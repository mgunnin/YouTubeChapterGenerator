[1.199 - 6.779] morning everybody David Shapiro here

[3.419 - 8.82] with your weekly video So today we're

[6.779 - 11.04] going to talk about the data flywheel

[8.82 - 14.280000000000001] the number one concept you need to know

[11.04 - 16.68] in the age of AI

[14.28 - 19.439999999999998] right off the bat what is a data

[16.68 - 22.88] flywheel in short the concept of the

[19.44 - 26.46] data flywheel is a simple virtuous cycle

[22.88 - 29.099] whereby you have users and you use those

[26.46 - 31.679000000000002] users to get more data you use that data

[29.099 - 33.059] to get better AI you use that better AI

[31.679 - 35.64] to get better products and services

[33.059 - 39.54] which in turn gets you more users and

[35.64 - 41.82] more data and so on and so forth and on

[39.54 - 44.1] into Infinity you get compounding

[41.82 - 45.36] returns and exponential growth

[44.1 - 47.28] so

[45.36 - 49.019999999999996] um I had to make this on my own graphic

[47.28 - 50.64] because I think most of the ones out

[49.02 - 52.2] there are probably copyrighted and I

[50.64 - 54.6] didn't want my video to get taken down

[52.2 - 55.68] but if you just Google image search data

[54.6 - 56.94] flywheel you'll see what I'm talking

[55.68 - 59.219] about there's plenty of good articles

[56.94 - 62.099999999999994] out there but let's Dive Right In

[59.219 - 63.78] okay so history of the flywheel

[62.1 - 67.02] turns out that flywheels are actually

[63.78 - 68.58] like super old like 8 000 years old

[67.02 - 70.56] um most of the time they're used for

[68.58 - 72.84] pottery wheels sharpening sticks and

[70.56 - 75.54] stones but basically it's this little

[72.84 - 77.93900000000001] bit down here that heavy Stone right and

[75.54 - 79.26] so what you do is you spin it and hold

[77.939 - 81.77999999999999] some of that energy and it'll keep

[79.26 - 84.18] spinning and you add more and more

[81.78 - 87.119] energy and it speeds up over time so

[84.18 - 90.0] that's kind of where it started uh but

[87.119 - 92.759] the concept of the flywheel applies

[90.0 - 95.52] today uh just as much as ever so

[92.759 - 97.799] flywheels are part of engines uh

[95.52 - 99.72] particularly large diesel engines but

[97.799 - 102.119] also uh flywheels are really important

[99.72 - 104.759] for things like race cars pretty much

[102.119 - 107.88] any electromechanical device or chemical

[104.759 - 110.57900000000001] mechanical device because it Smooths out

[107.88 - 112.439] the performance and and helps conserve

[110.579 - 115.38] some of that rotational energy some of

[112.439 - 117.119] that power but in all cases they start

[115.38 - 119.88] at zero and they have to speed up you

[117.119 - 122.399] can even have really big flywheels act

[119.88 - 123.899] as generators for when you lose power

[122.399 - 126.18] so all right so now you know what a

[123.899 - 127.86] flywheel is electromechanical device or

[126.18 - 130.08] chemical mechanical device that stores

[127.86 - 131.879] rotational energy sure you don't care

[130.08 - 134.94000000000003] about the physics of it

[131.879 - 137.76] where did the data flywheel begin

[134.94 - 141.54] um so apparently the whole thing was

[137.76 - 143.28] pitched to Jeff Bezos back in 2003 by

[141.54 - 144.54] Jim Collins

[143.28 - 147.3] um and then of course everyone's

[144.54 - 149.28] familiar with the Silicon Valley or are

[147.3 - 152.16000000000003] they in Silicon Valley anyways the the

[149.28 - 154.98] the tech darling of Amazon right Jeff

[152.16 - 158.34] Bezos has obviously been incredibly

[154.98 - 160.2] successful and Amazon has pioneered and

[158.34 - 162.84] championed all sorts of innovative

[160.2 - 164.64] things such as agile microservices

[162.84 - 167.70000000000002] continuous deployment continuous

[164.64 - 169.98] Improvement the data flywheel idea is

[167.7 - 171.959] one of the foundational principles of

[169.98 - 175.319] Amazon's success

[171.959 - 176.459] which is I don't understand why people

[175.319 - 178.56] more people don't know that that's why

[176.459 - 182.099] I'm making this video so now you know

[178.56 - 185.4] um okay so generative AI is basically a

[182.099 - 190.67999999999998] fire hose of data every inference that

[185.4 - 193.26000000000002] you send to uh gpt3 gpt4 uh for image

[190.68 - 195.48000000000002] generation every single thing that you

[193.26 - 197.34] send and get back is more data it's

[195.48 - 199.61999999999998] literally just a data producer it's a

[197.34 - 202.379] fire hose of data and so you should

[199.62 - 205.22] record every single inference or

[202.379 - 207.84] generation for LM

[205.22 - 210.659] image generators everything

[207.84 - 213.20000000000002] save it all save the input the output

[210.659 - 216.659] the context the metadata the parameters

[213.2 - 218.879] everything so there is so much data

[216.659 - 220.79899999999998] going on here and this is above and

[218.879 - 223.44] beyond the existing data that you get

[220.799 - 225.65900000000002] from like your insights and Telemetry

[223.44 - 228.299] from uh from your applications in web

[225.659 - 230.94] right because everyone by now is

[228.299 - 234.72] familiar with the fact that like uh you

[230.94 - 236.76] know linger time time on page uh all

[234.72 - 238.68] those other data points are available

[236.76 - 241.56] through things but now you have even

[238.68 - 243.06] more data which is your product is more

[241.56 - 245.58] directly related to your data your

[243.06 - 247.56] products and services so there's lots

[245.58 - 250.37900000000002] and lots and lots of data to consume

[247.56 - 253.379] already but then there's even more data

[250.379 - 257.09999999999997] to consume in the age of generative AI

[253.379 - 259.68] so how did I use this so I use this to

[257.1 - 261.47900000000004] go from 20 000 subscribers at the

[259.68 - 264.54] beginning of this year to over 50 000

[261.479 - 266.82] subscribers right now so I more than

[264.54 - 269.22] doubled my subscriber base in just a few

[266.82 - 271.86] months now obviously some of that is

[269.22 - 274.199] algorithmic luck right some of that was

[271.86 - 276.66] I noticed a trend and I made use of it

[274.199 - 279.41900000000004] but that was consuming the data so let

[276.66 - 281.1] me tell you how it wasn't entirely on

[279.419 - 283.38] accident

[281.1 - 286.86] for those of you who don't know YouTube

[283.38 - 288.3] gives you a dashboard for creators and

[286.86 - 290.639] some of the information that it gives

[288.3 - 293.16] you it's it tells you one which of your

[290.639 - 295.68] videos are doing best over time it tells

[293.16 - 298.5] you which uh channels and other videos

[295.68 - 301.199] are leading to yours so you can see okay

[298.5 - 302.4] who are my peers and competitors I don't

[301.199 - 304.56] really think of it as a competitive

[302.4 - 306.12] landscape because usually users want

[304.56 - 308.04] more of the content that you give them

[306.12 - 310.38] so it's more like peers right we're all

[308.04 - 312.47900000000004] offering similar similar content it's

[310.38 - 314.28] like a buffet

[312.479 - 316.32] um so it's like okay so they're they're

[314.28 - 317.75899999999996] doing this they're doing that

[316.32 - 319.44] um and there's a lot of information that

[317.759 - 321.3] you can consume above and beyond what

[319.44 - 322.979] the dashboard gives you so there is a

[321.3 - 324.84000000000003] service out there called vid IQ which I

[322.979 - 326.21999999999997] tried and I didn't like it

[324.84 - 328.56] um I didn't I didn't go for the paid

[326.22 - 329.699] tier but I was just like I saw like I

[328.56 - 331.259] was looking at the dashboard and I was

[329.699 - 333.539] like oh they're obviously using like an

[331.259 - 335.46000000000004] llm to generate some recommendations I

[333.539 - 337.8] was like I can do better than this so

[335.46 - 340.32] what I did was I took the transcripts

[337.8 - 342.66] from my own videos and I compared that

[340.32 - 345.71999999999997] with the comments that I was getting so

[342.66 - 347.28000000000003] I I took the transcript and comments and

[345.72 - 349.5] I said what about my videos is

[347.28 - 352.19899999999996] resonating with my users and so I use

[349.5 - 355.56] chat GPT to distill down and said okay

[352.199 - 358.139] this is what people like this is why and

[355.56 - 361.02] then I use those insights to generate

[358.139 - 362.82] um ideas for follow-up videos and to

[361.02 - 366.0] really kind of shape my narrative and

[362.82 - 368.09999999999997] delivery and it worked I got from 20 000

[366.0 - 370.979] Subs to 50 000 Subs in just a couple

[368.1 - 373.259] months that was uh how I really kind of

[370.979 - 376.02] nailed the algorithm them by using this

[373.259 - 378.18] data flywheel because more users more

[376.02 - 379.979] subscribers meant that I got more data

[378.18 - 382.1] right and the data in this case was in

[379.979 - 384.78] the form of comments but also the the

[382.1 - 386.759] numerical Telemetry right because you

[384.78 - 389.15999999999997] put out more videos you see which videos

[386.759 - 391.38] resonate which ones don't and I feed

[389.16 - 393.53900000000004] that into the AI in this case chat gbt

[391.38 - 395.94] which led to better videos better

[393.539 - 398.34] transcripts or Scripts

[395.94 - 400.74] which led to more users

[398.34 - 404.34] um so that's just I did it by hand right

[400.74 - 408.06] didn't just manual copying and pasting

[404.34 - 409.67999999999995] of of raw data into chat GPT obviously

[408.06 - 411.6] this is not the most sophisticated or

[409.68 - 413.58] sustainable model but it's just an

[411.6 - 416.52000000000004] example of how easy it is to get started

[413.58 - 420.419] with the data flywheel

[416.52 - 422.34] so with this concept of the data

[420.419 - 424.38] flywheel the goal the business goal is

[422.34 - 426.59999999999997] compounding Returns the positive

[424.38 - 428.34] feedback loop The Virtuous cycle or most

[426.6 - 430.44] conventionally The Snowball Effect

[428.34 - 432.17999999999995] because the more subscribers you have

[430.44 - 433.8] the better reach you have the more data

[432.18 - 436.08] you've got and that's just for YouTube

[433.8 - 438.36] this applies to every business out there

[436.08 - 441.599] whether it's for your marketing team

[438.36 - 445.56] your product team everything

[441.599 - 446.819] so how can businesses do this obviously

[445.56 - 448.44] not everyone out there is a YouTube

[446.819 - 450.66] Creator so you're like Dave come on get

[448.44 - 451.8] on with the show so there's a few rules

[450.66 - 454.91900000000004] of thumb

[451.8 - 456.3] um out there so one record everything if

[454.919 - 458.15999999999997] you're not recording your data you need

[456.3 - 459.41900000000004] to be recording it and not just the

[458.16 - 461.699] output from the models you need to

[459.419 - 464.28] record what goes in and out because

[461.699 - 466.68] that's how you're going to get the

[464.28 - 468.71999999999997] feedback later you also need to record

[466.68 - 470.94] the metadata the metadata the context

[468.72 - 472.44000000000005] and the parameters because that

[470.94 - 474.78] information will be critical with for

[472.44 - 476.88] making sense of the data later on number

[474.78 - 478.73999999999995] two you need to actually use the data

[476.88 - 480.65999999999997] there are so many companies out there

[478.74 - 482.639] that have a lot of data that they just

[480.66 - 485.34000000000003] never even look at so then they're

[482.639 - 487.86] spending money on storage

[485.34 - 489.17999999999995] and backups and they're not using it you

[487.86 - 491.699] might as well just delete the data if

[489.18 - 493.62] you're not going to use it number three

[491.699 - 494.88] and this is the hardest part is make

[493.62 - 497.28000000000003] changes

[494.88 - 499.979] pretty dashboards and charts and graphs

[497.28 - 502.5] don't mean a damn thing if you don't

[499.979 - 504.599] actually change your behaviors so

[502.5 - 508.02] sometimes that means you need to say hey

[504.599 - 511.02] like this email campaign didn't work

[508.02 - 512.8199999999999] let's just stop doing it or you know

[511.02 - 514.88] we're we're totally missing out on this

[512.82 - 517.2] sector we need to go after that sector

[514.88 - 518.88] you can change your outward Behavior

[517.2 - 521.0390000000001] which is how you engage with the market

[518.88 - 524.039] and your customers you can also change

[521.039 - 527.399] your internal Behavior so in the age of

[524.039 - 529.62] language technology that can be changing

[527.399 - 532.86] how you run and use meetings it can

[529.62 - 535.14] change it can be how you uh use jira and

[532.86 - 536.76] slack and teams and all that stuff

[535.14 - 539.279] so you have to change your behaviors

[536.76 - 542.64] your rules your structures change the

[539.279 - 544.26] system right and if you don't do that if

[542.64 - 546.0] you're if you if you just consume the

[544.26 - 547.62] data and look at it but then don't make

[546.0 - 549.6] any changes again you might as well just

[547.62 - 551.279] delete it and I'll tell you why that's

[549.6 - 553.8000000000001] the worst decision you can make in just

[551.279 - 555.0] a minute and number four iterate you're

[553.8 - 556.9799999999999] not going to get this right the first

[555.0 - 559.32] time right you're going to experiment

[556.98 - 561.9590000000001] you're going to have a lot of uh of uh

[559.32 - 564.0] false starts a lot of damp squibs that

[561.959 - 565.8599999999999] just it just doesn't hit but then when

[564.0 - 567.42] you do nail the algorithm you'll go

[565.86 - 569.04] you'll do what I did which is go from

[567.42 - 571.3199999999999] twenty thousand Subs to fifty thousand

[569.04 - 573.66] Subs in just a couple months and that's

[571.32 - 575.4590000000001] that's honestly the dream of every tech

[573.66 - 578.5799999999999] product out there right that's what chat

[575.459 - 580.38] GPT did they kept iterating on GPT

[578.58 - 583.26] technology until they found the version

[580.38 - 586.2] chat GPT that went to 100 million users

[583.26 - 588.42] in a couple of months

[586.2 - 590.1] all right so I'm talking about iteration

[588.42 - 591.36] and all this other stuff in data

[590.1 - 593.22] flywheels and you've probably never

[591.36 - 595.26] heard about either of these things but

[593.22 - 596.76] the good news is for all you business

[595.26 - 598.56] types out there there are a few

[596.76 - 600.66] Frameworks out there that you can just

[598.56 - 603.54] go read about and hire a consultant and

[600.66 - 605.16] uh and say Hey I want to improve my

[603.54 - 608.54] business processes both internally

[605.16 - 611.399] externally uh customer product whatever

[608.54 - 613.0799999999999] and you say I want to do this from a

[611.399 - 615.54] data Centric perspective because this is

[613.08 - 618.48] the age of AI so first one is agile

[615.54 - 621.7199999999999] agile is a software uh development thing

[618.48 - 624.1800000000001] which focuses on tight feedback loops so

[621.72 - 627.5600000000001] that is agile is how you can do the data

[624.18 - 631.0799999999999] flywheel for your your software teams

[627.56 - 632.959] Kaizen is about iterative Improvement

[631.08 - 636.24] more broadly across your whole business

[632.959 - 639.42] Six Sigma is a very similar thing where

[636.24 - 641.94] it focuses on reducing defects

[639.42 - 644.459] um and and flaws in the process and then

[641.94 - 646.32] finally I till the it infrastructure

[644.459 - 648.959] Library

[646.32 - 652.38] um is about service process Improvement

[648.959 - 654.0] internally so all of these read a book

[652.38 - 656.279] or two on it you'll see the common thing

[654.0 - 658.74] the what these all have in common is

[656.279 - 661.62] rapid feedback loops and those feedback

[658.74 - 663.42] loops are often human-based processes

[661.62 - 666.36] but there's no reason that you can't

[663.42 - 668.579] start adding more data and consuming

[666.36 - 671.4590000000001] that data with AI to get that feedback

[668.579 - 673.8599999999999] and make those Behavior changes

[671.459 - 675.4799999999999] all right so I know some of you guys are

[673.86 - 677.5790000000001] hot on the biscuit to get going so for

[675.48 - 679.8000000000001] all you business Chads out there like

[677.579 - 682.019] cool your britches for a second

[679.8 - 684.4799999999999] so while

[682.019 - 686.16] a data flywheel is really critical like

[684.48 - 689.1] if you want to survive in the age of AI

[686.16 - 693.42] you absolutely 100 need a data flywheel

[689.1 - 695.76] I guarantee you that uh 80 or 90 of the

[693.42 - 697.9799999999999] businesses that fail in the age of AI

[695.76 - 699.66] won't have a data flywheel that being

[697.98 - 701.64] said this isn't this alone isn't going

[699.66 - 703.26] to save you right

[701.64 - 704.6999999999999] um doing the if you say like hey we need

[703.26 - 705.899] to do a data flywheel before you even

[704.7 - 708.24] have a product

[705.899 - 710.24] you're missing the point you need a

[708.24 - 713.339] decent enough product or service first

[710.24 - 714.6] to prime the pump right if you if you

[713.339 - 716.4590000000001] look at that graphic where you start

[714.6 - 718.2] with more users right I've already got

[716.459 - 720.66] users on my YouTube channel I earned

[718.2 - 722.88] that the hard way right if your product

[720.66 - 724.56] doesn't have any users

[722.88 - 726.3] data flywheel isn't going to matter

[724.56 - 727.92] because remember the data flywheel is

[726.3 - 730.019] based on inertia it's based on momentum

[727.92 - 732.7199999999999] if it's sitting there inert it's

[730.019 - 735.48] actually going to slow you down more

[732.72 - 738.36] um it's not an it's not a shiny new toy

[735.48 - 739.8000000000001] it is nice but as a business person you

[738.36 - 741.899] shouldn't even be thinking about it once

[739.8 - 743.399] it gets set up let your teams handle it

[741.899 - 746.04] because they're going to be the ones to

[743.399 - 748.56] to know how to do it

[746.04 - 750.54] um most importantly that concept all

[748.56 - 752.0999999999999] these philosophies of iterative

[750.54 - 756.0] improvements start with executive

[752.1 - 758.4590000000001] leadership if you don't buy in on a on a

[756.0 - 760.32] visceral level and understand process

[758.459 - 761.9399999999999] Improvement and iterative Improvement at

[760.32 - 763.5] an executive level

[761.94 - 766.62] doesn't matter you might as well not

[763.5 - 769.2] even do it all right so

[766.62 - 770.76] in order to really power up obviously

[769.2 - 774.6] eventually you're going to want really

[770.76 - 776.7] fat fat data pipelines to feed your uh

[774.6 - 779.399] flywheel right

[776.7 - 781.019] there's a few mantras that you can adopt

[779.399 - 783.48] and this is for executives all the way

[781.019 - 786.66] down to engineers and product owners and

[783.48 - 788.639] Architects data is the new oil it

[786.66 - 791.04] baffles me how few people have heard

[788.639 - 793.8] this term in the age of generative AI

[791.04 - 798.18] data is the new oil

[793.8 - 801.18] um live it learn it embody it embrace it

[798.18 - 804.2399999999999] think about it talk about it another one

[801.18 - 806.9399999999999] is slow is smooth smooth is fast this is

[804.24 - 809.22] the idea of kick starting your data

[806.94 - 811.5600000000001] flywheel slowly at first remember it's a

[809.22 - 813.779] big heavy thing right all your products

[811.56 - 815.579] all your services all your data it's

[813.779 - 817.4399999999999] really cumbersome you're not going to

[815.579 - 819.779] light this fire real fast you got to

[817.44 - 821.519] start slow that'll be smooth but the

[819.779 - 824.1] idea is that it cranks up over time

[821.519 - 826.44] right it starts accelerating

[824.1 - 827.76] garbage and garbage out for those of you

[826.44 - 829.8000000000001] who are not familiar with machine

[827.76 - 831.3] learning and data science if you feed it

[829.8 - 832.9799999999999] a bunch of garbage data you're going to

[831.3 - 834.66] get a lot of garbage results so don't

[832.98 - 836.16] put pressure to say like we need to

[834.66 - 837.24] consume all of our data I know that I

[836.16 - 839.459] said

[837.24 - 842.04] record all your data that doesn't mean

[839.459 - 844.079] consume all your data right you have a

[842.04 - 846.8389999999999] big pile of data you need to figure out

[844.079 - 848.579] which signals to pay attention to

[846.839 - 851.1600000000001] and that goes to the last thing which is

[848.579 - 854.3389999999999] what gets measured gets managed this

[851.16 - 857.2199999999999] actually comes from ITIL so ITIL talks

[854.339 - 859.3800000000001] about things like manage your uh your

[857.22 - 861.72] time to resolution your mean your mttx

[859.38 - 865.74] mean time to resolution and a few other

[861.72 - 867.3000000000001] things in your it service Portal same

[865.74 - 869.22] thing can happen for customers right

[867.3 - 870.7199999999999] whether it's an internal customer or

[869.22 - 872.82] external customer

[870.72 - 874.86] how long does it take to satisfy

[872.82 - 877.6800000000001] customer demand how much does it cost

[874.86 - 879.3000000000001] you those kinds of things if you're not

[877.68 - 881.699] measuring the right things you're

[879.3 - 883.199] completely blind and this these are all

[881.699 - 885.0] some of the mantras this is not an

[883.199 - 887.3389999999999] exhaustive list but these are some of

[885.0 - 890.639] the mantras that can go into building

[887.339 - 894.899] that mentality of the data flywheel

[890.639 - 897.1800000000001] so in the age of AI uh being where oil

[894.899 - 899.279] is the new data stop hemorrhaging your

[897.18 - 900.7199999999999] data or your oil because then you're

[899.279 - 902.639] just losing money it's money out the

[900.72 - 903.899] door and that's all there is to it I

[902.639 - 907.339] believe yes that's the end of the video

[903.899 - 907.339] all right thanks for watching
