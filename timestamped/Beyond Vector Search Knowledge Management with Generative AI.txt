[0.179 - 4.5600000000000005] good morning everybody David Shapiro

[2.399 - 7.56] here with another video this is going to

[4.56 - 9.0] be a comprehensive Deep dive based on my

[7.56 - 11.579999999999998] experience both my professional

[9.0 - 13.98] experience before Ai and my Consulting

[11.58 - 17.16] experience uh now that I am an AI

[13.98 - 19.619] specialist so today's topic is Knowledge

[17.16 - 22.14] Management uh specifically when Vector

[19.619 - 24.359] search alone is not enough

[22.14 - 25.8] so if you're watching this video I'm

[24.359 - 27.900000000000002] imagining that these are some of the

[25.8 - 29.96] problems you're facing you've built a

[27.9 - 32.46] chat bot or some other similar

[29.96 - 36.3] generative AI tool probably with the

[32.46 - 38.219] chat GPT API or similar API it can do

[36.3 - 41.699999999999996] some stuff you've cut your teeth you've

[38.219 - 44.34] got your feet wet on this technology it

[41.7 - 46.14] can do some things very well but you're

[44.34 - 48.6] you know working on figuring out how to

[46.14 - 50.94] steer these things you even have some

[48.6 - 52.68] Integrations maybe you figured out how

[50.94 - 54.8] to you know have dynamically composed

[52.68 - 57.42] prompts you've done search augmentation

[54.8 - 58.86] and then maybe you're even using you

[57.42 - 61.559000000000005] know API calls and that sort of thing

[58.86 - 64.199] but you're finding really profound

[61.559 - 66.29899999999999] limitations because on its own operating

[64.199 - 68.58] in a vacuum these chat Bots and other

[66.299 - 70.26] tools they're really kind of useless

[68.58 - 72.84] because they don't have the context of

[70.26 - 75.18] the rest of your organization or other

[72.84 - 76.74000000000001] context of the of whatever task or

[75.18 - 78.60000000000001] pipeline that it's in and that sort of

[76.74 - 80.1] thing so you've got constraints on

[78.6 - 82.02] Windows size how do you keep it from

[80.1 - 84.29899999999999] hallucinating how do you keep it

[82.02 - 86.64] grounded and so basically now you have a

[84.299 - 88.2] sad little lost robot and you need to

[86.64 - 89.34] figure out how to teach it to get to the

[88.2 - 92.22] next level

[89.34 - 93.9] so here's a little bit about me I was an

[92.22 - 96.84] Enterprise I.T infrastructure engineer

[93.9 - 99.0] for about 15 years for those of you that

[96.84 - 101.22] are not familiar with it infrastructure

[99.0 - 103.979] we work with basically everyone network

[101.22 - 106.979] security database software Enterprise

[103.979 - 108.84] Architects we have to have meetings with

[106.979 - 111.299] if you've got you know brick and mortar

[108.84 - 112.979] stores we help with that we help with

[111.299 - 115.14] the data center pretty much everything

[112.979 - 116.82] my focus was on automation cloud and

[115.14 - 119.28] virtualization

[116.82 - 121.13999999999999] uh now I consult on AI products and

[119.28 - 123.479] strategy on top of of course my YouTube

[121.14 - 125.28] uh Channel

[123.479 - 127.2] um and for those of you that are new

[125.28 - 128.88] actually how my channel got started was

[127.2 - 130.25900000000001] a lot of coding tutorials which if you

[128.88 - 133.07999999999998] go to my the home page of my YouTube

[130.259 - 135.89999999999998] channel I've got it all in a list I've

[133.08 - 138.66000000000003] got like 50 or so coding tutorials still

[135.9 - 139.86] out there now the reason that I made

[138.66 - 142.02] this video is because I had like three

[139.86 - 144.54000000000002] or four clients in a row basically ask

[142.02 - 146.52] the same or very similar questions and

[144.54 - 148.07999999999998] so when that happens I know that uh this

[146.52 - 149.58] is resonating

[148.08 - 153.59900000000002] um and then finally I married a

[149.58 - 155.64000000000001] librarian uh and so a lot of what we uh

[153.599 - 157.85999999999999] talk about has to do with data and

[155.64 - 160.07999999999998] information uh storage retrieval

[157.86 - 162.66000000000003] curation that sort of stuff so I'm

[160.08 - 165.0] bringing a tremendous amount of of uh

[162.66 - 167.819] different disciplines and experience uh

[165.0 - 169.86] in order to bring you this video so

[167.819 - 171.06] here's before this is the last slide

[169.86 - 172.56] before we get started I promise we're

[171.06 - 174.36] about to get in there

[172.56 - 175.8] um but you need to know what kind of

[174.36 - 179.04000000000002] information I'm going to give you and

[175.8 - 180.3] how you need to use it so uh right up

[179.04 - 182.7] next I'm going to give you a lot of

[180.3 - 185.34] Concepts so I understand that many of

[182.7 - 187.56] you watching are either CEOs directors

[185.34 - 189.12] managers developers

[187.56 - 190.8] um many of you probably don't know the

[189.12 - 192.78] first thing about librarianship or

[190.8 - 193.739] information science many of you probably

[192.78 - 196.379] don't know the first thing about

[193.739 - 197.4] philosophy and epistemics which you

[196.379 - 200.51899999999998] might be thinking why is that even

[197.4 - 202.31900000000002] relevant you will see and then some of

[200.519 - 203.519] you many of you probably are from

[202.319 - 205.01899999999998] computer science and information

[203.519 - 206.87900000000002] technology

[205.019 - 209.76] um so I'll be talking with you basically

[206.879 - 211.739] translating all this into your language

[209.76 - 213.599] or if you're a business leader you might

[211.739 - 215.879] not know any of these disciplines

[213.599 - 217.26] uh now your mission should you choose to

[215.879 - 218.459] accept it you got to wrap your head

[217.26 - 219.48] around these Concepts you're probably

[218.459 - 220.98] going to need to watch this video

[219.48 - 223.79899999999998] several times you might need to have

[220.98 - 226.319] chat GPT or Claude or perplexity open on

[223.799 - 227.76000000000002] the side so you can jot down Concepts to

[226.319 - 230.76] follow up on

[227.76 - 234.42] um but basically we're going to push you

[230.76 - 237.84] towards being a transdisciplinary uh AI

[234.42 - 239.099] product design manager and strategist so

[237.84 - 240.72] it'll take you a little while to

[239.099 - 242.64] integrate these ideas and to synthesize

[240.72 - 244.98] something new so like I said you

[242.64 - 247.14] probably want to download the slide deck

[244.98 - 249.23899999999998] um uh it's the slide decks are all

[247.14 - 251.099] available on my GitHub Link in the

[249.239 - 253.5] description you can also sign up on my

[251.099 - 255.72] patreon I do consultation at any given

[253.5 - 258.78] time I have about 20 clients

[255.72 - 260.94] um and so I'm happy to jump on a call

[258.78 - 262.03999999999996] with you to explain these Concepts more

[260.94 - 264.54] specifically

[262.04 - 265.97900000000004] in the past so this is for all you

[264.54 - 268.02000000000004] people that heard me in the past say

[265.979 - 270.3] that I don't sign ndas I've actually

[268.02 - 272.88] I've contacted a lawyer friend and we're

[270.3 - 274.38] getting a consultation NDA set up so I

[272.88 - 277.86] know that that has been a reason that

[274.38 - 280.08] many people have hesitated so in the

[277.86 - 282.96000000000004] next week or two I'll have a official

[280.08 - 284.34] NDA that I can sign that will protect

[282.96 - 285.96] both of our interests because obviously

[284.34 - 288.23999999999995] I need to keep Consulting with clients

[285.96 - 291.59999999999997] and I need to make sure that I don't

[288.24 - 294.6] transfer any of my personal IP while

[291.6 - 296.1] also protecting your IP okay now we've

[294.6 - 298.02000000000004] laid all the groundwork let's get on to

[296.1 - 299.40000000000003] the show also I apologize if the

[298.02 - 300.65999999999997] microphone phases in and out of

[299.4 - 304.25899999999996] existence I'm trying to figure out how

[300.66 - 305.82000000000005] to mask that off but yeah so I do have a

[304.259 - 308.22] proper green screen behind me which is

[305.82 - 310.139] why uh I can gesture in the background

[308.22 - 312.78000000000003] doesn't um glitch in and out of

[310.139 - 314.16] existence all right sorry tangent now

[312.78 - 317.03999999999996] for the concepts and solutions there's

[314.16 - 319.38000000000005] about 10 or 15 slides here so buckle in

[317.04 - 321.12] and let's go through these the first

[319.38 - 322.32] concept you need to know is data

[321.12 - 323.94] ontologies

[322.32 - 325.979] now I'm not going to read all of these

[323.94 - 328.38] per se you can pause the video and read

[325.979 - 330.18] them but mostly I'm just going to tell

[328.38 - 333.419] you like okay when I say data ontology

[330.18 - 335.22] what do I mean ontology is the uh fill

[333.419 - 338.34] out the philosophical or epistemic

[335.22 - 341.1] discipline of state of being what does

[338.34 - 342.84] something actually exist as and so this

[341.1 - 345.53900000000004] comes from database Theory it also comes

[342.84 - 347.46] from philosophy and epistemics which is

[345.539 - 349.68] basically okay if you had to

[347.46 - 352.44] characterize data and information in a

[349.68 - 354.24] vacuum or scientifically this is what

[352.44 - 355.62] you would call your ontologies

[354.24 - 358.08] so if you've got any database

[355.62 - 359.88] administrators or database engineers in

[358.08 - 361.68] your team you can talk with them more

[359.88 - 363.65999999999997] about like what is a data ontology and

[361.68 - 366.539] how do you understand data because

[363.66 - 368.759] here's the thing is many people who are

[366.539 - 370.68] new to generative AI they're thinking in

[368.759 - 372.6] terms of text and qualitative data

[370.68 - 374.58] whereas you might be familiar with

[372.6 - 376.8] thinking in terms of quantitative data

[374.58 - 379.74] and relational databases but data is

[376.8 - 381.84000000000003] data and particularly your data

[379.74 - 384.18] Engineers your data automation

[381.84 - 385.56] Specialists your data analysts they're

[384.18 - 387.419] going to be able to understand and help

[385.56 - 390.18] you understand like what ontologies are

[387.419 - 392.15999999999997] so for instance if you work with a lot

[390.18 - 394.02] of like squishy text Data like user

[392.16 - 396.3] comments or

[394.02 - 398.15999999999997] um you know KB articles or stuff that is

[396.3 - 400.02000000000004] still data it is not relational

[398.16 - 401.22] mathematical data and I know that there

[400.02 - 402.96] are going to be some purists out there

[401.22 - 404.699] who say well if it's not math it's not

[402.96 - 407.46] data but that's not really how the world

[404.699 - 408.96000000000004] works so if you talk to Librarians too

[407.46 - 410.63899999999995] we'll love to talk to you about the

[408.96 - 412.38] different kinds of data and how to

[410.639 - 414.78000000000003] categorize them

[412.38 - 415.919] all right next up is you need to be

[414.78 - 418.38] familiar with the concepts of

[415.919 - 421.08] reconciliation and validation so

[418.38 - 423.479] reconciliation often is is a process

[421.08 - 425.94] that's more used in the finance side of

[423.479 - 428.15999999999997] your business and so you reconcile

[425.94 - 430.21999999999997] spreadsheets you reconcile numbers but

[428.16 - 433.319] reconciliation applies to literally

[430.22 - 435.18] every uh discipline that has to deal

[433.319 - 437.03900000000004] with data where you've got data coming

[435.18 - 440.039] from different sources with different

[437.039 - 441.78] levels of validation different levels of

[440.039 - 443.15999999999997] trustworthiness

[441.78 - 444.9] um so for instance one of the products

[443.16 - 447.06] that my wife works on I forgot to

[444.9 - 450.12] mention she she went from librarianship

[447.06 - 452.4] to um to a data product owner so like

[450.12 - 454.139] her experience is also directly relevant

[452.4 - 456.71999999999997] so one of the products that she works on

[454.139 - 458.58] they have sources of information that

[456.72 - 460.08000000000004] come from vendors but some of the

[458.58 - 462.479] information is wrong and it is

[460.08 - 464.88] hilariously wrong and so they they have

[462.479 - 467.28] to basically reconcile uh multiple

[464.88 - 469.919] sources of data and say okay which which

[467.28 - 471.84] data source are we going to hold as the

[469.919 - 474.65999999999997] source of truth how do we validate it

[471.84 - 476.52] because you know know regard taking a

[474.66 - 479.46000000000004] step outside of language technology like

[476.52 - 483.539] llms you have to do data validation

[479.46 - 484.85999999999996] regardless uh so Hallucination is just a

[483.539 - 486.539] new kind of thing that you have to

[484.86 - 488.759] address so another way to think of that

[486.539 - 490.02] is imagine that you've got various

[488.759 - 491.819] sources of information you've got

[490.02 - 493.85999999999996] multiple internal sources of information

[491.819 - 496.319] you might have vendors and apis that you

[493.86 - 498.0] get information from how do you how do

[496.319 - 500.03900000000004] you cross validate and how do you

[498.0 - 502.02] reconcile those differences so that's

[500.039 - 504.65999999999997] something that you can talk about

[502.02 - 506.46] um like I said reconciliation is a

[504.66 - 507.90000000000003] really big thing in your finance

[506.46 - 509.69899999999996] department so if you got any Finance

[507.9 - 511.02] people talk to them about how they

[509.699 - 513.24] reconcile different pieces of

[511.02 - 514.86] information and different sources and

[513.24 - 517.26] you'll get a tremendous amount of

[514.86 - 518.94] insight about how you know so for

[517.26 - 520.4399999999999] instance like error detection cleansing

[518.94 - 521.8800000000001] all that sort of stuff all the

[520.44 - 523.5] Transformations that it goes through so

[521.88 - 526.98] on and so forth

[523.5 - 529.86] uh factual grounding and so what factual

[526.98 - 532.74] grounding is this is this is uh more

[529.86 - 534.839] from uh philosophy but it's also super

[532.74 - 537.66] super important with language technology

[534.839 - 539.4590000000001] which is you just need to State what

[537.66 - 542.279] your factual grounding is what is the

[539.459 - 544.0189999999999] Bedrock set of facts data and assertions

[542.279 - 545.459] that you're operating from

[544.019 - 547.5] um so you know what data are you using

[545.459 - 549.54] what empirical evidence where are your

[547.5 - 551.76] sources is it consistent that sort of

[549.54 - 554.2199999999999] thing but really just like think about

[551.76 - 556.019] when you're building either chat Bots or

[554.22 - 557.339] other language technology what is the

[556.019 - 558.839] factual grounding and you have to be

[557.339 - 561.24] explicit you have to give it the factual

[558.839 - 563.399] grounding even if it's just a few like

[561.24 - 567.12] like sentence fragments where you say

[563.399 - 569.82] like X is true or assume Y is the case

[567.12 - 572.16] or uh giving it some context like this

[569.82 - 575.22] is a construction company it's amazing

[572.16 - 577.38] how much just a few little keywords will

[575.22 - 579.9590000000001] will shape and steer language models

[577.38 - 582.3] because if you tell it like Hey we're a

[579.959 - 583.8599999999999] Wall Street firm like that's two words

[582.3 - 586.68] or three words Wall Street from term

[583.86 - 587.94] versus like you know uh you know

[586.68 - 590.519] military

[587.94 - 592.62] um Hardware you know consultant those

[590.519 - 594.54] two like just those two things give it

[592.62 - 596.58] so much context and it's going to

[594.54 - 598.38] perform a lot better by grounding

[596.58 - 600.1800000000001] whatever it's doing in some of those

[598.38 - 602.22] facts so that's what I mean by factual

[600.18 - 605.3389999999999] grounding just give it really objective

[602.22 - 607.6800000000001] empirical Baseline like what is what is

[605.339 - 609.72] going on because remember you as a as a

[607.68 - 611.5799999999999] person you implicitly have all that

[609.72 - 613.2] factual grounding because you know your

[611.58 - 615.1800000000001] job you see your physical surroundings

[613.2 - 617.339] the language model exists in a tiny

[615.18 - 620.519] little bottle bottled up brain out in

[617.339 - 623.6400000000001] The Ether somewhere so it has no context

[620.519 - 627.12] source of Truth so source of Truth this

[623.64 - 629.9399999999999] comes from uh well I used it a lot in

[627.12 - 632.1] IIT infrastructure because uh so say for

[629.94 - 634.98] instance you've got uh different login

[632.1 - 636.839] databases you've got uh different uh

[634.98 - 639.1800000000001] user roles you've got authentication

[636.839 - 641.1] servers and that sort of stuff so then

[639.18 - 642.8389999999999] you have to have a source of Truth who

[641.1 - 646.019] is allowed to log into what so this is

[642.839 - 648.3000000000001] like role-based access control and so if

[646.019 - 650.339] you don't have a single source of Truth

[648.3 - 652.079] um which you can end up

[650.339 - 653.94] story from the front if you give

[652.079 - 655.3199999999999] developers the keys to the kingdom you

[653.94 - 657.0] end up with no single source of truth

[655.32 - 660.24] because developers generally don't

[657.0 - 662.579] understand authentication schemes and so

[660.24 - 664.62] you end up with local logins on every

[662.579 - 666.959] server or multiple key servers and that

[664.62 - 669.36] sort of thing and that is bad because

[666.959 - 671.2199999999999] one that is a security nightmare to it

[669.36 - 673.92] is an access Nightmare and so on and so

[671.22 - 675.5400000000001] forth so this is why accessibility audit

[673.92 - 678.7199999999999] Trails data Integrity that sort of stuff

[675.54 - 681.18] it's a source of Truth for any given

[678.72 - 683.399] data ontology or type you need to

[681.18 - 684.959] identify who is the who is the key

[683.399 - 686.579] Authority here

[684.959 - 688.5] um so say say for instance you're

[686.579 - 690.2399999999999] getting a stock market data right

[688.5 - 692.88] there's going to be certain apis like

[690.24 - 694.32] what is it the Eddie system where you

[692.88 - 696.899] can download you know all the financial

[694.32 - 698.399] filings from the SEC that is a source of

[696.899 - 701.16] truth that is what I mean by a source of

[698.399 - 703.5] truth if you're trying to keep time nist

[701.16 - 705.48] is the is the source of Truth for the

[703.5 - 706.86] current time but why because they sync

[705.48 - 708.839] their clocks to all the nuclear clocks

[706.86 - 710.399] around the world so by identifying

[708.839 - 712.86] sources of Truth for each information

[710.399 - 715.56] piece of information you can establish

[712.86 - 718.38] layers of truthfulness and reliability

[715.56 - 720.42] and validity and you can also establish

[718.38 - 722.399] some internal sources of Truth so say

[720.42 - 724.74] for instance you have like a master KB

[722.399 - 727.019] article or a set of documents that is

[724.74 - 729.24] well curated and you say if there's ever

[727.019 - 731.339] any disagreement default to this it's

[729.24 - 734.4590000000001] like having a constitution right

[731.339 - 737.0400000000001] this is how America makes uh judicial

[734.459 - 738.7199999999999] decisions is that the constitution is

[737.04 - 740.64] held up as the ultimate source of Truth

[738.72 - 743.64] and then there's layers of truthiness

[740.64 - 746.04] below the US Constitution

[743.64 - 747.959] um axiomatic principles so axiomatic

[746.04 - 749.8199999999999] principles are the uh are the core

[747.959 - 751.68] assertions the first the first uh

[749.82 - 754.2] principles or the fundamental

[751.68 - 755.76] assumptions that you're making

[754.2 - 757.5] um when you're doing a particular

[755.76 - 760.019] business task or working with certain

[757.5 - 761.76] information and so one thing that I

[760.019 - 763.86] recommend people doing is any

[761.76 - 766.3199999999999] assumptions that you're making say them

[763.86 - 770.22] out loud tell the tell the model that

[766.32 - 772.019] like hey assume that X is true or assume

[770.22 - 773.94] that this is the the ethical framework

[772.019 - 776.4590000000001] that we're using when we're making this

[773.94 - 777.899] decision or um you know one of the

[776.459 - 780.18] things that we're operating on is like

[777.899 - 782.22] this model of SEO because if you just

[780.18 - 784.4399999999999] say like write an optimized web page

[782.22 - 786.899] it'll it'll do its best but then if you

[784.44 - 790.019] say write an SEO optimized web page

[786.899 - 792.54] according to this Theory right by by

[790.019 - 794.279] giving the model axiomatic principles

[792.54 - 797.3389999999999] you're going to get much better results

[794.279 - 799.92] that are adherent to specific paradigms

[797.339 - 802.0790000000001] schools of thought that sort of thing

[799.92 - 805.139] and this applies to whatever business

[802.079 - 806.8199999999999] domain you're in whether you're doing uh

[805.139 - 808.139] copywriting whether you're doing

[806.82 - 809.94] hospitals

[808.139 - 811.0790000000001] whether you're and also which country

[809.94 - 812.8800000000001] you're in

[811.079 - 815.3389999999999] um so different countries have different

[812.88 - 817.4399999999999] uh regulations and so if you say adhere

[815.339 - 819.3000000000001] to like you know the cultural norms of

[817.44 - 820.98] Sweden these are the you know these are

[819.3 - 822.779] the cultural axiomatic beliefs that

[820.98 - 826.019] we're operating by when you interact

[822.779 - 829.32] with your users or whatever uh okay so

[826.019 - 831.0] next data taxonomy so taxonomy the the

[829.32 - 833.7600000000001] most familiar taxonomy that people are

[831.0 - 836.279] familiar with is the uh is the the

[833.76 - 838.3199999999999] taxonomy of life right so you've got you

[836.279 - 839.9399999999999] know the the five kingdoms of life and

[838.32 - 842.4590000000001] then you've got various file and Order

[839.94 - 844.74] below that and so what you can do is you

[842.459 - 846.3599999999999] can create data taxonomies that are very

[844.74 - 848.399] similar where you've got you know

[846.36 - 850.5600000000001] basically nested categories where like

[848.399 - 852.54] at the highest level of your AI

[850.56 - 854.88] infrastructure or data infrastructure

[852.54 - 857.579] you've got like is this a financial

[854.88 - 861.779] record is this an employee record or

[857.579 - 863.579] whatever uh you can generally follow uh

[861.779 - 866.1] kind of the Departments because each

[863.579 - 869.76] department is can be considered a data

[866.1 - 872.4590000000001] domain or a domain of expertise and then

[869.76 - 875.7] of course each department may be further

[872.459 - 877.56] subdivided and this is not necessarily

[875.7 - 880.139] I'm not saying like put it in a file

[877.56 - 882.66] system this is really good for metadata

[880.139 - 884.82] and if you have a standardized taxonomy

[882.66 - 887.1] that you can use across your entire

[884.82 - 888.1800000000001] organization this is a non-trivial

[887.1 - 890.22] problem

[888.18 - 892.38] but imagine how

[890.22 - 894.839] um Linnaeus felt when he was trying to

[892.38 - 897.48] create a taxonomy for literally all life

[894.839 - 899.1] on Earth if you treat your business's

[897.48 - 901.86] data and you say we're going to come up

[899.1 - 903.4200000000001] with a singular taxonomy for literally

[901.86 - 905.639] every piece of data in our company

[903.42 - 908.16] that's going to really increase the

[905.639 - 910.0790000000001] search ability in the future which is

[908.16 - 913.3389999999999] going to make it much more accessible to

[910.079 - 913.3389999999999] all of your AI technology

[913.38 - 917.82] a classification system so a

[915.72 - 920.5790000000001] classification system is very similar to

[917.82 - 922.1990000000001] a taxonomy and so the the two most

[920.579 - 923.16] familiar classification systems that

[922.199 - 925.199] you're going to be familiar with in

[923.16 - 926.88] terms of information are going to be the

[925.199 - 929.399] Dewey Decimal System

[926.88 - 931.8] which is a way of just rapidly bucketing

[929.399 - 933.18] hey this piece of information here's a

[931.8 - 934.92] number that just kind of gives it a

[933.18 - 936.2399999999999] rapid category the other one that's a

[934.92 - 938.399] little bit more comprehensive is the

[936.24 - 940.44] Library of Congress which is also which

[938.399 - 944.76] is a more taxonomical system because it

[940.44 - 947.5790000000001] has some some nested hierarchies now the

[944.76 - 949.9399999999999] advantages here is that this allows you

[947.579 - 952.8599999999999] to address novel pieces of information

[949.94 - 955.5600000000001] so whether you have a very rigid

[952.86 - 956.94] taxonomy uh in which like you're saying

[955.56 - 959.16] like hey this is the structure in which

[956.94 - 961.3800000000001] we put we we slot literally everything

[959.16 - 963.18] in our business or you have a more

[961.38 - 966.24] general purpose classification system

[963.18 - 967.68] that says hey given the context of this

[966.24 - 969.779] piece of information where it came from

[967.68 - 972.18] what it's for this is its classification

[969.779 - 974.639] again you can use both of these in your

[972.18 - 977.6389999999999] metadata which is going to add more

[974.639 - 981.899] layers of how do you use this

[977.639 - 983.519] data curation so uh one thing that a lot

[981.899 - 986.459] of people have asked me about is like

[983.519 - 988.74] Version Control and so uh having married

[986.459 - 991.199] a librarian and talking about uh like

[988.74 - 993.54] archival studies and reference

[991.199 - 994.8] librarianship and all that for kind of

[993.54 - 996.5999999999999] fun stuff

[994.8 - 998.459] um I know and what you were probably

[996.6 - 1001.0400000000001] discovering is the data curation is a

[998.459 - 1003.0189999999999] non-trivial task uh data gets updated

[1001.04 - 1005.06] over time it gets invalidated it comes

[1003.019 - 1007.519] from different sources and so this is

[1005.06 - 1009.38] why I talk so much about librarianship

[1007.519 - 1012.079] is because you basically have to have

[1009.38 - 1013.88] your master collection and you know you

[1012.079 - 1015.7399999999999] you might keep the older books or the

[1013.88 - 1017.48] older documents that are out of date but

[1015.74 - 1019.94] then you need metadata to say hey this

[1017.48 - 1022.4590000000001] is out of date this has expired if you

[1019.94 - 1024.26] use servicenow servicenow actually has

[1022.459 - 1026.24] settings where you can have KB articles

[1024.26 - 1027.8799999999999] automatically expire it's one of the

[1026.24 - 1030.199] most annoying things

[1027.88 - 1031.699] for people who have like no this is a

[1030.199 - 1033.919] permanent KB article and then it like

[1031.699 - 1036.439] automatically archives it but the idea

[1033.919 - 1039.0200000000002] is that data and information has an

[1036.439 - 1040.22] expiration date or it might have an

[1039.02 - 1042.1399999999999] expiration date and you need to be

[1040.22 - 1043.819] explicit about this

[1042.14 - 1046.3390000000002] um and so this is what I mean by data

[1043.819 - 1048.9189999999999] curation and so by by constantly

[1046.339 - 1051.08] updating your collection updating the

[1048.919 - 1053.179] tags updating the metadata updating the

[1051.08 - 1055.46] expiration dates this is get these are

[1053.179 - 1058.7] all going to be clues that allow you to

[1055.46 - 1060.74] sift through and say okay well if we

[1058.7 - 1063.32] have two otherwise identical articles

[1060.74 - 1065.299] trust the more recent one or if we have

[1063.32 - 1067.46] two you know like relatively identical

[1065.299 - 1071.179] articles trust the one that came from

[1067.46 - 1074.1200000000001] the the more trusted source of Truth

[1071.179 - 1076.76] ETL so ETL stands for extract transform

[1074.12 - 1079.1599999999999] and load this is a this is a data

[1076.76 - 1081.14] warehousing where it basically

[1079.16 - 1083.419] um this is this is how you move data

[1081.14 - 1085.46] around the data warehouse which is why I

[1083.419 - 1087.6200000000001] imagine this nice futuristic data

[1085.46 - 1090.38] warehouse with heavy equipment moving

[1087.62 - 1093.9189999999999] data around uh and so

[1090.38 - 1095.48] ETL is an existing practice that your

[1093.919 - 1098.48] data people are going to be familiar

[1095.48 - 1100.4] with and now generative AI is just going

[1098.48 - 1102.44] to be a new tool for them to move data

[1100.4 - 1103.88] around their data warehouses it's going

[1102.44 - 1106.22] to give them more options in terms of

[1103.88 - 1108.14] transformations of the data it's going

[1106.22 - 1110.66] to give them more options in terms of

[1108.14 - 1112.88] validating the data automating the data

[1110.66 - 1114.2] processing and that sort of thing so

[1112.88 - 1116.3600000000001] again this is an established business

[1114.2 - 1119.059] practice that you can just research and

[1116.36 - 1122.059] say oh generative AI is just a new tool

[1119.059 - 1123.799] in this bucket and it's an existing uh

[1122.059 - 1126.26] discipline

[1123.799 - 1128.059] and then finally information foraging so

[1126.26 - 1131.48] this one comes from information science

[1128.059 - 1132.98] uh so information foraging everyone if

[1131.48 - 1134.419] you exist today you know what

[1132.98 - 1136.7] information foraging is you might not

[1134.419 - 1138.44] have the um the word for it so

[1136.7 - 1140.6000000000001] information foraging is when you go out

[1138.44 - 1142.22] into an information environment looking

[1140.6 - 1144.1399999999999] for information and you're not exactly

[1142.22 - 1145.94] sure what you're looking for but you

[1144.14 - 1147.44] have an information need and you're

[1145.94 - 1150.14] trying to solve that information need

[1147.44 - 1152.419] and so then you go to your favorite

[1150.14 - 1155.0] favorite hunting grounds whether it's

[1152.419 - 1157.5200000000002] Google or YouTube or you know you've got

[1155.0 - 1160.039] a a Discord or slack channel that you go

[1157.52 - 1161.6] ask questions and so then information

[1160.039 - 1163.64] foraging is something that you're

[1161.6 - 1165.9189999999999] actually going to have to automate and

[1163.64 - 1167.419] enable your autonomous agents your chat

[1165.919 - 1169.8200000000002] Bots and your other generative AI

[1167.419 - 1172.039] cognitive architectures to be able to

[1169.82 - 1173.059] engage in information foraging because

[1172.039 - 1174.44] they're going to have an information

[1173.059 - 1176.539] need

[1174.44 - 1179.059] um you know in order to serve a user

[1176.539 - 1180.62] query or whatever and so then it's like

[1179.059 - 1181.52] okay well where do they go looking for

[1180.62 - 1183.86] that information

[1181.52 - 1186.2] is the information spoon fed to them by

[1183.86 - 1188.36] automatic search queries does the agent

[1186.2 - 1190.16] have a model where it's able to say hey

[1188.36 - 1193.1] I need this kind of information where

[1190.16 - 1195.3400000000001] can I go find it that sort of thing

[1193.1 - 1198.4399999999998] okay so I just threw a whole lot of

[1195.34 - 1199.6399999999999] complex Concepts at you it's like

[1198.44 - 1200.66] drinking from a fire hose you're

[1199.64 - 1202.1000000000001] probably going to need to watch this

[1200.66 - 1204.44] several times or go check out the slide

[1202.1 - 1206.539] deck and do a lot of googling now let's

[1204.44 - 1209.0] get to the Practical implementation

[1206.539 - 1211.52] all right so the the number one thing

[1209.0 - 1214.46] absolutely that I recommend to literally

[1211.52 - 1215.96] every customer is start with a data

[1214.46 - 1218.299] Centric model

[1215.96 - 1221.179] um so this is based on the Von Neumann

[1218.299 - 1223.4] architecture of computing where uh

[1221.179 - 1226.76] Computing happens in memory and then the

[1223.4 - 1229.46] memory is uh operated on by computation

[1226.76 - 1231.919] but really the the the center of it is

[1229.46 - 1235.7] your data it is your information treat

[1231.919 - 1238.2800000000002] all of your business processes and tasks

[1235.7 - 1239.96] as fundamentally as information problems

[1238.28 - 1242.36] so basically you have information

[1239.96 - 1244.16] flowing into your organization or

[1242.36 - 1245.539] circulating around your organization and

[1244.16 - 1248.72] then flowing out of your organization

[1245.539 - 1250.16] and that information can be any kind of

[1248.72 - 1252.559] information it can be a bill that needs

[1250.16 - 1255.14] to be paid it can be a customer query it

[1252.559 - 1257.1789999999999] can be regulatory requirements literally

[1255.14 - 1258.919] everything you do is fundamentally an

[1257.179 - 1261.26] information problem and there are

[1258.919 - 1263.24] information needs and I apologize I

[1261.26 - 1265.28] meant to add information needs as one of

[1263.24 - 1267.2] the concepts so let me do that real

[1265.28 - 1269.6] quick I've said information needs a few

[1267.2 - 1272.66] times so information needs comes from

[1269.6 - 1275.299] the world of librarianship where anytime

[1272.66 - 1277.1000000000001] a patron walks into a library the reason

[1275.299 - 1279.08] that they walk into the library and go

[1277.1 - 1281.299] to the circulation desk is because they

[1279.08 - 1282.98] have an information need now that

[1281.299 - 1285.02] information you talk to a librarian they

[1282.98 - 1287.0] have the most hilarious stories those

[1285.02 - 1289.039] information needs could be anything from

[1287.0 - 1291.08] there's a snake in the lobby what do I

[1289.039 - 1293.539] do about it to there's a three-year-old

[1291.08 - 1295.9399999999998] throwing up in the kids section to I'm

[1293.539 - 1298.7] looking for a book on like you know

[1295.94 - 1300.98] penis enhancement or whatever Librarians

[1298.7 - 1303.98] get the weirdest thing so they they you

[1300.98 - 1305.9] uh a client or a customer or Patron

[1303.98 - 1307.94] comes to you with an information need

[1305.9 - 1309.8600000000001] and then there is a process to one

[1307.94 - 1312.14] figure out what that information need

[1309.86 - 1314.84] truly is and then serve that information

[1312.14 - 1316.94] need so by treating literally everything

[1314.84 - 1319.1589999999999] that happens in your company as an

[1316.94 - 1321.26] information need you're going to really

[1319.159 - 1323.0590000000002] change your orientation to it because

[1321.26 - 1325.4] then what is the outcome also the

[1323.059 - 1327.6789999999999] outcome if you use the librarianship

[1325.4 - 1329.0590000000002] model is very clear the patron walks

[1327.679 - 1330.74] away with the piece of information that

[1329.059 - 1333.08] they need the book that they need or

[1330.74 - 1334.159] their problem is solved that kind of

[1333.08 - 1336.5] thing

[1334.159 - 1338.0590000000002] um so that's that's number one of the

[1336.5 - 1339.919] data Centric model number two

[1338.059 - 1342.5] information thy God

[1339.919 - 1344.96] um in in uh the fiction space for us

[1342.5 - 1347.72] novel writers we have this phrase that

[1344.96 - 1349.52] says um thy God the reader which is

[1347.72 - 1351.799] basically we might be writing for

[1349.52 - 1353.36] ourself but it's ultimately the reader

[1351.799 - 1355.82] that's going to decide what it is that

[1353.36 - 1358.039] we write and do and what succeeds and in

[1355.82 - 1360.1399999999999] this case information and data that is

[1358.039 - 1361.52] your God because everything in your

[1360.14 - 1364.88] business is an information problem

[1361.52 - 1366.98] information is the actual thing that you

[1364.88 - 1368.6000000000001] are serving in order to provide the

[1366.98 - 1371.059] goods and services that make your

[1368.6 - 1372.9189999999999] company viable so goods and services are

[1371.059 - 1374.48] the the output that's the economic

[1372.919 - 1376.64] interface between your company and the

[1374.48 - 1379.22] world but information is how you do that

[1376.64 - 1380.72] and information is how you do that well

[1379.22 - 1383.1200000000001] um so another way to think about this is

[1380.72 - 1386.48] data is the new oil so information I got

[1383.12 - 1389.2399999999998] data is the new oil by adopting a data

[1386.48 - 1392.9] Centric approach to literally every

[1389.24 - 1394.76] um good service process protocol task

[1392.9 - 1398.24] um you'll have a better understanding of

[1394.76 - 1400.28] how uh generative AI can intersect and

[1398.24 - 1401.659] augment your business and then finally

[1400.28 - 1402.98] this is just a really kind of

[1401.659 - 1404.6000000000001] boilerplate

[1402.98 - 1406.159] um way to think about what generative AI

[1404.6 - 1408.5] can do and this these are the types of

[1406.159 - 1410.419] Transformations that generative AI can

[1408.5 - 1412.52] do so there's three fundamental types

[1410.419 - 1414.679] and the way that you can categorize it

[1412.52 - 1417.3799999999999] is what is what is the size of the input

[1414.679 - 1419.1200000000001] versus the size of the output so there's

[1417.38 - 1421.3400000000001] shrinking operations or shrinking

[1419.12 - 1423.62] Transformations which is summarization

[1421.34 - 1425.78] extraction and classification so you put

[1423.62 - 1428.1789999999999] in a big chunk of text and you get out a

[1425.78 - 1430.3999999999999] small chunk of text that is that

[1428.179 - 1432.799] the second type is translation or Tran

[1430.4 - 1434.6000000000001] or other transformation where this the

[1432.799 - 1436.4] the input size and the output size is

[1434.6 - 1438.5] roughly the same

[1436.4 - 1440.539] um and so in this case this might be a

[1438.5 - 1442.46] format change it might be changing to

[1440.539 - 1444.559] another language so for instance you

[1442.46 - 1447.02] might translate from like XML to Json

[1444.559 - 1448.34] that's a translation example you might

[1447.02 - 1450.679] translate it from English to Japanese

[1448.34 - 1453.1399999999999] that's a translation example another

[1450.679 - 1455.1200000000001] example from for a shrinking thing is

[1453.14 - 1457.94] evaluation and so I forget to I forgot

[1455.12 - 1460.58] to add that but a shrinking operation is

[1457.94 - 1462.8600000000001] I use this extensively in using Claude

[1460.58 - 1464.6589999999999] and chat GPT to provide feedback so

[1462.86 - 1466.2199999999998] feedback and critique is another example

[1464.659 - 1468.44] of a shrinking transformation where it's

[1466.22 - 1470.419] like assess the quality of this thing

[1468.44 - 1472.52] give me critique and so the output is

[1470.419 - 1474.919] smaller than the input and then finally

[1472.52 - 1477.08] expanding the input is smaller than the

[1474.919 - 1479.3200000000002] output and so this is stuff like

[1477.08 - 1483.1399999999999] brainstorming synthesizing drafting

[1479.32 - 1486.5] being creative uh you know drafting Pros

[1483.14 - 1489.14] which Claude can do that sometimes but I

[1486.5 - 1490.34] but I tell it not to because it's really

[1489.14 - 1493.1000000000001] hot on the biscuit to just draft

[1490.34 - 1495.799] whatever it wants and it is not good

[1493.1 - 1497.78] um often but you can draft legal

[1495.799 - 1499.76] documentation you can draft KB articles

[1497.78 - 1502.1589999999999] so by understanding that you have these

[1499.76 - 1503.9] three fundamental types of data

[1502.159 - 1505.8200000000002] Transformations that is available to you

[1503.9 - 1507.3200000000002] through generative AI then you can

[1505.82 - 1510.2] sub-categorize okay what other

[1507.32 - 1512.6589999999999] operations do we have access to maybe

[1510.2 - 1514.7] I'll do a video on on all the different

[1512.659 - 1517.22] kinds of operations and I'll create my

[1514.7 - 1518.8400000000001] own generative AI data transformation

[1517.22 - 1522.14] taxonomy

[1518.84 - 1524.36] okay search strategies so there are four

[1522.14 - 1526.46] fundamental search strategies that are

[1524.36 - 1529.2199999999998] available to you today with generative

[1526.46 - 1531.98] AI and so basically as I mentioned just

[1529.22 - 1534.14] a minute ago you have information needs

[1531.98 - 1535.88] as a person as a business your chat Bots

[1534.14 - 1537.8600000000001] have information needs your users have

[1535.88 - 1538.94] information needs everyone has user

[1537.86 - 1541.52] information needs and we talked about

[1538.94 - 1543.2] information foraging so these are the

[1541.52 - 1544.7] the actual strategies the techniques

[1543.2 - 1547.1000000000001] that you can use to approach your

[1544.7 - 1548.539] information foraging problems now the

[1547.1 - 1549.9189999999999] first one obviously is Vector search

[1548.539 - 1551.6589999999999] you're probably watching this video

[1549.919 - 1553.94] because you realize that Vector search

[1551.659 - 1556.0390000000002] is not cutting the Mustard anymore

[1553.94 - 1558.14] so there's a few primary things that

[1556.039 - 1560.24] people don't understand about Vector

[1558.14 - 1563.659] search Vector search is not like Google

[1560.24 - 1566.059] and it is not like SQL where Vector

[1563.659 - 1569.2990000000002] search people try and treat it like

[1566.059 - 1572.4189999999999] query document so where you have like in

[1569.299 - 1573.679] SQL you might have a a specific you know

[1572.419 - 1576.38] structured query like find everything

[1573.679 - 1578.779] that includes X Y and Z with you know a

[1576.38 - 1580.64] b and c criteria for Google you're kind

[1578.779 - 1582.919] of matching you know keywords to a

[1580.64 - 1585.679] document but really what Vector search

[1582.919 - 1588.3200000000002] really shines for is clustering similar

[1585.679 - 1591.14] documents and so what I mean by that is

[1588.32 - 1593.4189999999999] that uh in order like here's here's a

[1591.14 - 1595.64] perfect example documents with similar

[1593.419 - 1598.159] formats and similar contexts are going

[1595.64 - 1601.76] to be the best thing to kind of cluster

[1598.159 - 1603.94] and use so take imagine that you're a

[1601.76 - 1606.98] scientist and you're looking for like

[1603.94 - 1609.02] every paper that is similar to a paper

[1606.98 - 1611.059] you're looking at so for literature

[1609.02 - 1612.86] review you say hey give me every paper

[1611.059 - 1615.799] like this one so you feed them you feed

[1612.86 - 1617.7199999999998] the vector search an entire paper of you

[1615.799 - 1619.279] know you vectorize an entire paper and

[1617.72 - 1621.98] then it's going to find everything that

[1619.279 - 1624.14] is semantically similar to that paper

[1621.98 - 1625.76] um and it's going to be perfect so that

[1624.14 - 1627.0800000000002] is one of the primary things that Vector

[1625.76 - 1629.36] search that people get wrong about

[1627.08 - 1631.76] Vector search yes there are vectors and

[1629.36 - 1635.12] embeddings that are made for for a query

[1631.76 - 1636.799] document matching but those are not good

[1635.12 - 1639.08] um they might get good in the future but

[1636.799 - 1641.059] that but from a mathematical perspective

[1639.08 - 1642.74] that is not what Vector searching is for

[1641.059 - 1644.96] Vector searching is more for clustering

[1642.74 - 1647.36] similar things together you might do the

[1644.96 - 1649.64] same thing for KB articles so imagine

[1647.36 - 1651.9189999999999] that like you know you have an internal

[1649.64 - 1653.6000000000001] KB system and you bring up a KB article

[1651.919 - 1655.7] and then at the end it's like here's the

[1653.6 - 1657.98] five most similar KB articles and so

[1655.7 - 1660.38] rather than than clustering similar KBS

[1657.98 - 1662.84] or similar scientific papers or other

[1660.38 - 1664.5800000000002] documentation on keywords or other

[1662.84 - 1667.34] things you can cluster them based on

[1664.58 - 1669.62] what's actually written on the page this

[1667.34 - 1672.559] can also be useful for things like

[1669.62 - 1673.6999999999998] fictional documents so some people keep

[1672.559 - 1675.6789999999999] you know

[1673.7 - 1677.659] piles and piles and piles of fictional

[1675.679 - 1680.0590000000002] documents together and so then it's like

[1677.659 - 1682.159] hey you know I've got this this

[1680.059 - 1683.6] character sheet and this chapter you

[1682.159 - 1685.88] know find find all the other chapters

[1683.6 - 1686.539] like this other chapter uh that sort of

[1685.88 - 1688.8200000000002] thing

[1686.539 - 1690.26] number two is knowledge graphs so

[1688.82 - 1692.779] knowledge graphs are kind of a hybrid

[1690.26 - 1694.82] between relational databases and some of

[1692.779 - 1696.08] these these squishier more web-like

[1694.82 - 1697.76] things

[1696.08 - 1699.74] um the the if you're not familiar with

[1697.76 - 1701.48] knowledge wraps probably the easiest way

[1699.74 - 1703.76] to think about a knowledge graph is

[1701.48 - 1706.1] think of a Wikipedia page where

[1703.76 - 1707.72] Wikipedia has references and crosslinks

[1706.1 - 1709.3999999999999] to other pages and each of those

[1707.72 - 1712.7] crosslinks has a semantic meaning

[1709.4 - 1714.98] there's a reason that you know that the

[1712.7 - 1717.32] Eiffel Tower page is linked to the Paris

[1714.98 - 1719.6] France page and so that is what I mean

[1717.32 - 1721.96] by knowledge graphs so like a knowledge

[1719.6 - 1724.6999999999998] graph is just basically the web

[1721.96 - 1726.74] with a with a little bit more like you

[1724.7 - 1728.9] know whatever anyways you can use

[1726.74 - 1730.88] language technology to create Traverse

[1728.9 - 1731.9] and reach knowledge graphs I know that

[1730.88 - 1733.3400000000001] there's going to be some purists out

[1731.9 - 1735.26] there saying that that's not what it is

[1733.34 - 1737.299] at all but from a functional standpoint

[1735.26 - 1739.64] a knowledge graph is just a web of

[1737.299 - 1741.08] content number three is metadata

[1739.64 - 1743.8400000000001] filtering so most Vector search

[1741.08 - 1746.48] databases have uh the ability to filter

[1743.84 - 1748.9399999999998] based on metadata and certainly you know

[1746.48 - 1750.74] a relational databases do as well and so

[1748.94 - 1754.88] this is why I talked so much about

[1750.74 - 1756.74] metadata and data curation is because if

[1754.88 - 1759.44] you have you know Vector search

[1756.74 - 1761.0] Collections and you're you're surfacing

[1759.44 - 1763.279] things that are not necessarily relevant

[1761.0 - 1764.84] it's because you're searching documents

[1763.279 - 1766.58] you're you're surfacing documents that

[1764.84 - 1768.4399999999998] are very similar to what your search

[1766.58 - 1769.76] query is but they're not necessarily

[1768.44 - 1771.799] relevant because you don't have the

[1769.76 - 1773.539] correct ontologies or taxonomy or

[1771.799 - 1776.36] classification system where it's like

[1773.539 - 1779.539] okay do you know do a search with this

[1776.36 - 1781.82] Vector but I only want you know this

[1779.539 - 1784.279] particular type of data this particular

[1781.82 - 1786.5] category and then finally number four is

[1784.279 - 1788.539] indexes or a table of contents so this

[1786.5 - 1790.7] is something that as far as I know I

[1788.539 - 1792.86] pioneered in some of my coding

[1790.7 - 1795.679] experiments but basically you you

[1792.86 - 1797.9599999999998] generate a table of contents or a menu

[1795.679 - 1800.299] that your that your language model can

[1797.96 - 1802.3990000000001] choose from and it says oh I need you

[1800.299 - 1804.32] know this KB article and then it you

[1802.399 - 1806.4189999999999] know it can request and fetch that

[1804.32 - 1807.98] specific KB article where basically

[1806.419 - 1810.14] you're kind of cutting out the middleman

[1807.98 - 1812.539] instead of having semantic search you're

[1810.14 - 1814.46] saying hey read this read this document

[1812.539 - 1816.559] read this menu read this table of

[1814.46 - 1818.299] contents tell me which information you

[1816.559 - 1820.1] need I'll go get it and then you can

[1818.299 - 1822.32] have like nested layers of tables of

[1820.1 - 1823.82] contents and whatever this may or may

[1822.32 - 1825.2] not pan out as useful but in the

[1823.82 - 1828.1399999999999] experiments that I've done with it it's

[1825.2 - 1829.3400000000001] been extremely useful because then with

[1828.14 - 1832.3990000000001] the given context of whatever

[1829.34 - 1835.52] information problem your language model

[1832.399 - 1837.9799999999998] is facing it will be able to say this is

[1835.52 - 1840.02] probably what I need access to

[1837.98 - 1842.8990000000001] uh the next thing for practical

[1840.02 - 1845.0] implementation is a gated process so

[1842.899 - 1847.399] there's many things that you can do in

[1845.0 - 1848.72] one step and of course like if you ask

[1847.399 - 1850.8799999999999] the machine learning engineers and

[1848.72 - 1852.98] scientists the AI is going to be able to

[1850.88 - 1855.679] do everything in one step one day but uh

[1852.98 - 1857.8990000000001] from a business perspective first just

[1855.679 - 1859.46] know and even from a biological

[1857.899 - 1862.1589999999999] perspective that's not how human brains

[1859.46 - 1863.6000000000001] work we all have internal workflows and

[1862.159 - 1865.7] processes even if you're not fully

[1863.6 - 1867.559] conscious of them and so there's three

[1865.7 - 1870.38] primary steps that you can think of for

[1867.559 - 1873.08] addressing any information need first is

[1870.38 - 1875.0590000000002] the uh is the information query so in

[1873.08 - 1876.4399999999998] that example that I gave you for uh

[1875.059 - 1878.1789999999999] someone approaching the circulation desk

[1876.44 - 1879.3200000000002] at a library

[1878.179 - 1881.659] um there's What's called the reference

[1879.32 - 1884.539] interview which Librarians use to figure

[1881.659 - 1886.7600000000002] out what uh what the what the patron

[1884.539 - 1888.3799999999999] needs so like what is your question what

[1886.76 - 1890.12] what is the context behind your question

[1888.38 - 1892.3400000000001] what is what is the outcome you're

[1890.12 - 1893.36] looking for is it a valid request right

[1892.34 - 1896.0] because if you walk up to the

[1893.36 - 1897.62] circulation desk and you say like hey

[1896.0 - 1899.539] like you know something's happening on

[1897.62 - 1901.2199999999998] the other side of the city the librarian

[1899.539 - 1902.779] might be like okay that sounds important

[1901.22 - 1905.179] but I can't help you

[1902.779 - 1907.22] um so number one is the first gate is

[1905.179 - 1909.5] the information query you you judge the

[1907.22 - 1910.76] valid the the validity of it is it an

[1909.5 - 1913.58] appropriate question is it information

[1910.76 - 1916.1589999999999] that we can actually serve or not

[1913.58 - 1918.62] number two is distill extract and

[1916.159 - 1920.5390000000002] utilize so this is imagine when you go

[1918.62 - 1921.86] get a stack of books the library you

[1920.539 - 1923.0] know you've talked to the librarian

[1921.86 - 1925.399] you've got a legitimate information

[1923.0 - 1927.62] query and then you go get a stack of

[1925.399 - 1928.8799999999999] books so then what you do is you take a

[1927.62 - 1930.799] dozen books and you flip through them

[1928.88 - 1933.0200000000002] and you take notes you copy the pages

[1930.799 - 1935.299] that you need and you compile the most

[1933.02 - 1937.8799999999999] Salient bits of information so that now

[1935.299 - 1939.32] you have uh you've you've Consolidated

[1937.88 - 1940.88] the information that you need to

[1939.32 - 1942.86] actually solve your information problem

[1940.88 - 1945.0800000000002] and then finally format and deliver

[1942.86 - 1947.36] let's let's imagine that you went to the

[1945.08 - 1950.059] library to help you with

[1947.36 - 1951.74] um filing building plans for a new house

[1950.059 - 1953.96] right so

[1951.74 - 1955.58] while you're at the library you got all

[1953.96 - 1957.2] the code books you got all the

[1955.58 - 1959.24] architectural diagrams you got it all

[1957.2 - 1960.799] copied now what you do is you package it

[1959.24 - 1962.059] up and send it out to the architect or

[1960.799 - 1964.1] you send it out

[1962.059 - 1966.32] um to the inspector or whatever so

[1964.1 - 1968.48] that's what I mean by inspect or sorry

[1966.32 - 1970.82] the query to still extract utilize and

[1968.48 - 1972.799] then format and deliver by using a gated

[1970.82 - 1975.2] process with with uh you know

[1972.799 - 1977.4189999999999] checkpoints decision points workflows

[1975.2 - 1979.52] but by by treating them as as

[1977.419 - 1981.5590000000002] fundamentally different phases and

[1979.52 - 1984.62] handoff processes you're going to have a

[1981.559 - 1986.6] lot more better uh results with your

[1984.62 - 1989.3799999999999] Automation and then finally assembly

[1986.6 - 1992.48] lines look at all of your business

[1989.38 - 1994.8200000000002] whether it's internal or external

[1992.48 - 1998.3600000000001] whether it's customer facing or not

[1994.82 - 2000.519] everything that you do is work tasks and

[1998.36 - 2002.1999999999998] work products moving through an assembly

[2000.519 - 2004.24] line now it's a digital assembly line

[2002.2 - 2006.7] sometimes it's a verbal assembly line

[2004.24 - 2008.98] but if you if you look at your business

[2006.7 - 2010.779] as a collection of assembly lines you're

[2008.98 - 2013.299] going to have a much better way of

[2010.779 - 2015.34] automating it so there's a few primary

[2013.299 - 2017.679] components of assembly lines one is

[2015.34 - 2019.24] inputs where do work items come from

[2017.679 - 2021.46] where do the materials come from where

[2019.24 - 2024.22] does the information come from emails

[2021.46 - 2026.019] calls bills API calls does it come from

[2024.22 - 2028.3600000000001] vendors does it come from users does it

[2026.019 - 2030.94] come from internal stakeholders there's

[2028.36 - 2032.32] always inputs to every assembly line

[2030.94 - 2034.3600000000001] and again like I said there's going to

[2032.32 - 2036.399] be multiple assembly lines number two

[2034.36 - 2038.1399999999999] there's stations the whole point of an

[2036.399 - 2041.6789999999999] assembly line is that you quickly move

[2038.14 - 2044.22] work products or work items or materials

[2041.679 - 2046.539] um from one station to the next and just

[2044.22 - 2048.82] deciding which station it goes to next

[2046.539 - 2050.679] is one part of the problem but then also

[2048.82 - 2052.48] what information tools and

[2050.679 - 2055.54] Transformations are done at that station

[2052.48 - 2057.399] so for instance in automobile assembly

[2055.54 - 2059.139] lines you know the first part is you

[2057.399 - 2060.7] build the frame then you start bolting

[2059.139 - 2062.2000000000003] on the you know the motor and the

[2060.7 - 2064.48] electronics and then you put in the

[2062.2 - 2065.859] wiring and then finally you paint it so

[2064.48 - 2067.419] like you have the painting station you

[2065.859 - 2069.7599999999998] have the welding station you have the

[2067.419 - 2071.74] the engine station that sort of thing so

[2069.76 - 2073.8990000000003] think about the Stations of your

[2071.74 - 2076.839] business you know where to when does a

[2073.899 - 2079.06] work product move from procurement to

[2076.839 - 2082.659] Material Handling Windows when does it

[2079.06 - 2085.96] move from Finance to billing to wherever

[2082.659 - 2088.06] else it goes interfaces so look at the

[2085.96 - 2090.639] interfaces so an interface is a handoff

[2088.06 - 2093.099] point this is when it changes from one

[2090.639 - 2095.8] person or one Department to another is

[2093.099 - 2097.96] it coming from your vendor to your CFO

[2095.8 - 2100.119] is it going from your finance department

[2097.96 - 2101.859] to your it Department that's what I mean

[2100.119 - 2103.96] by interfaces

[2101.859 - 2105.94] and then finally outputs what is the

[2103.96 - 2108.28] final result of a of a given work

[2105.94 - 2111.2200000000003] product or process is it that a Bill

[2108.28 - 2113.7400000000002] gets paid is that is it that a patient

[2111.22 - 2116.2] gets discharged from the hospital is it

[2113.74 - 2117.7] that you know material is delivered on

[2116.2 - 2119.3199999999997] site and then you're you know it's out

[2117.7 - 2121.7799999999997] of your hands what are the input

[2119.32 - 2123.28] stations interfaces and outputs treat it

[2121.78 - 2124.8390000000004] all like information moving through a

[2123.28 - 2127.0600000000004] digital assembly line or a digital

[2124.839 - 2130.119] Factory and you will be able to start

[2127.06 - 2131.74] working towards those polymorphic

[2130.119 - 2132.76] applications that I talked about in a

[2131.74 - 2134.6189999999997] previous video

[2132.76 - 2136.78] all right thanks for watching I hope you

[2134.619 - 2138.339] got a lot out of this like I said links

[2136.78 - 2140.5600000000004] all the most important links are in the

[2138.339 - 2142.72] description uh cheers have a good one

[2140.56 - 2146.64] reach out on LinkedIn and patreon I'm

[2142.72 - 2146.64] happy to help you out have a good one
