[0.9 - 4.74] hey everyone David Shapiro here with

[3.0 - 7.34] another video today we're going to be

[4.74 - 9.54] doing chat GPT for writing fiction

[7.34 - 11.519] specifically writing long-form fiction

[9.54 - 13.739999999999998] like novels obviously this is a practice

[11.519 - 16.08] that takes a while so in this first

[13.74 - 17.58] video I'm hoping to just get to a solid

[16.08 - 20.22] outline and then we'll call it a day

[17.58 - 23.82] before we get started though I wanted to

[20.22 - 26.4] explain that uh I have monetized some of

[23.82 - 28.8] my YouTube videos uh people are getting

[26.4 - 31.259999999999998] a lot of value out of them

[28.8 - 33.96] um and I want to take the ads out but I

[31.26 - 36.899] was not able to get my uh patreon goals

[33.96 - 38.76] met so my goal is to get to four

[36.899 - 41.579] thousand dollars a month so that I can

[38.76 - 43.8] uh pay all the pail of my bills have

[41.579 - 46.26] health insurance that sort of thing

[43.8 - 49.019999999999996] um and then I can permanently demonetize

[46.26 - 51.718999999999994] all of my videos that is my goal now if

[49.02 - 53.7] people would prefer ads we can do that I

[51.719 - 56.82] don't really care one way or another but

[53.7 - 58.68000000000001] it would be good if uh if if we can do

[56.82 - 59.879] it this way all right so without further

[58.68 - 62.399] ado

[59.879 - 64.559] let's talk about writing stories so this

[62.399 - 66.84] is something that I have spent a

[64.559 - 67.86] tremendous amount of time on uh

[66.84 - 70.08] personally

[67.86 - 72.799] um writing is uh is one of my top

[70.08 - 76.92] hobbies and it's how I met my now fiance

[72.799 - 78.24000000000001] and so uh in fact one of the things that

[76.92 - 81.18] attracted a lot of people to my channel

[78.24 - 84.17999999999999] was using these language models to write

[81.18 - 87.24000000000001] fiction and uh in point of fact chat GPT

[84.18 - 91.14] completely changed some of my plans

[87.24 - 93.78] around my auto Muse Suite of tools

[91.14 - 95.82] um so because of that like I'm not going

[93.78 - 97.43900000000001] to try and compete with chat GPT why

[95.82 - 100.25899999999999] bother right I'm gonna do something else

[97.439 - 103.32] in the meantime let me show you how to

[100.259 - 105.72] think about this uh tool so that you can

[103.32 - 107.1] write fiction long form fiction anyone

[105.72 - 109.2] can do it

[107.1 - 111.78] um but you kind of you got you got to

[109.2 - 113.7] know about like writing a story so

[111.78 - 116.04] um I have the advantage of I had a

[113.7 - 118.74000000000001] premise already in mind so the premise

[116.04 - 122.10000000000001] that I had in mind was that I wanted to

[118.74 - 124.38] write a story from the POV of a

[122.1 - 126.65899999999999] courtesan during the Golden Age of Rome

[124.38 - 129.239] and I wanted it to be like a palace

[126.659 - 130.979] Intrigue kind of story but also the

[129.239 - 133.92000000000002] Golden Age of Rome or the the height of

[130.979 - 136.31900000000002] the Roman power there's a huge amount of

[133.92 - 138.89999999999998] stories that can be told in that you

[136.319 - 140.7] know there's um uh there's you know

[138.9 - 143.459] whether it's Augustus or Caesar and Gaul

[140.7 - 145.07999999999998] or whatever is going on in Egypt or you

[143.459 - 147.959] know the Revolt of the Jews or whatever

[145.08 - 149.70000000000002] there's all kinds of cool stuff so

[147.959 - 151.739] um the way that I like to start these

[149.7 - 155.04] kinds of conversations is you just tell

[151.739 - 156.959] it what you're doing so you say hey I'm

[155.04 - 157.92] writing a novel

[156.959 - 160.44] um

[157.92 - 163.14] I need your help I found that if you're

[160.44 - 164.7] polite it like it it it copies your tone

[163.14 - 167.45899999999997] so if you just if you're very thorough

[164.7 - 169.01899999999998] and polite it tends to be more helpful

[167.459 - 171.48] um if you just give it like flat

[169.019 - 172.92000000000002] instructions it's usually willing to

[171.48 - 174.48] help as well but I mean there's no

[172.92 - 175.5] nothing wrong with being polite to the

[174.48 - 177.89999999999998] machine

[175.5 - 179.34] um it also feels good to be polite

[177.9 - 180.54] um I'm writing a novel and I need your

[179.34 - 185.70000000000002] help

[180.54 - 189.84] um this is a uh Palace Intrigue slash uh

[185.7 - 193.5] historical fiction slash Adventure uh

[189.84 - 195.48] set during uh the Golden Age of the

[193.5 - 197.459] Roman Empire

[195.48 - 198.07999999999998] it follows

[197.459 - 201.239] um

[198.08 - 202.37900000000002] uh a courtesan

[201.239 - 207.36] um

[202.379 - 210.42] so help me brainstorm this story the

[207.36 - 212.76000000000002] goal today is to get a very solid

[210.42 - 213.54] outline so if you tell it what your goal

[212.76 - 215.22] is

[213.54 - 219.239] um it's like sure let's do that

[215.22 - 221.76] um what questions do you have so if you

[219.239 - 224.34] if you tell it if you if you finalize it

[221.76 - 226.14] with saying that ask me questions if

[224.34 - 229.08] this is where the power of a dialogue

[226.14 - 232.01899999999998] comes in because you might be making

[229.08 - 233.64000000000001] assumptions in your mind that are not

[232.019 - 235.14000000000001] going to translate

[233.64 - 236.76] um so let's see it says sure I'm happy

[235.14 - 238.14] to help brainstorm ideas for your novel

[236.76 - 240.599] to get started can you give me some more

[238.14 - 242.33999999999997] information about the Curtis courtesan

[240.599 - 244.07999999999998] and her role in the story what is her

[242.34 - 245.81900000000002] goal or motivation do you have any

[244.08 - 247.68] specific historical events or figures

[245.819 - 250.79899999999998] that you would like to incorporate these

[247.68 - 251.48000000000002] are phenomenal questions okay

[250.799 - 254.70000000000002] um

[251.48 - 256.38] great questions and I'm saying this as a

[254.7 - 258.419] I'm not a

[256.38 - 260.76] I guess I am a semi-pro writer I have

[258.419 - 263.52] made some money from writing fiction

[260.76 - 266.759] um but uh I'm also just a very

[263.52 - 268.5] passionate writer and I uh a good like

[266.759 - 270.90000000000003] more than half of my friends are writers

[268.5 - 275.28] that's like my social life

[270.9 - 277.919] um the other half is all AI people

[275.28 - 279.29999999999995] um okay great questions so

[277.919 - 284.84] um

[279.3 - 289.38] well I really wanted to have a close

[284.84 - 295.25899999999996] visceral experience of

[289.38 - 298.259] um the Roman world uh during its height

[295.259 - 303.36] um for instance I really love the

[298.259 - 304.97900000000004] Intrigue of Assassin's Creed

[303.36 - 309.36] Odyssey

[304.979 - 312.12] um I also really loved the book

[309.36 - 313.62] cushiel's Dart and if you know what

[312.12 - 315.0] cushel's DART is you know that it's a

[313.62 - 317.46] very spicy story we're not going to go

[315.0 - 319.139] that spicy at least Well Chad GPT will

[317.46 - 322.79999999999995] get mad at me if I try and go that spicy

[319.139 - 325.02] We're not gonna we're gonna toe them no

[322.8 - 327.66] I'm not gonna get demonetized over that

[325.02 - 331.32] um so we'll just leave it at that um

[327.66 - 332.58000000000004] so that's the kind of story I want to

[331.32 - 334.56] tell

[332.58 - 337.74] um I'll need help

[334.56 - 340.02] uh fleshing out

[337.74 - 342.06] um the characters so for for some

[340.02 - 343.979] reference the reason that I have some of

[342.06 - 346.74] this knowledge already is because I was

[343.979 - 349.86] using my own tools Auto Muse tools while

[346.74 - 351.419] I was brainstorming this those are still

[349.86 - 353.28000000000003] being built but they've been kind of put

[351.419 - 356.34] on the back burner we'll get to that

[353.28 - 357.65999999999997] later but the tools are coming

[356.34 - 359.46] um I'll need help fleshing out the

[357.66 - 363.84000000000003] characters

[359.46 - 367.25899999999996] um backstories motivations goals

[363.84 - 367.919] um now in terms of

[367.259 - 372.72] um

[367.919 - 374.88] uh historical events or characters I was

[372.72 - 375.56] thinking maybe

[374.88 - 377.21999999999997] um

[375.56 - 379.8] Augustus

[377.22 - 382.86] or Hadrian

[379.8 - 385.259] um or some of the uh

[382.86 - 389.96000000000004] five good

[385.259 - 394.91900000000004] Emperors uh basically I want a setting

[389.96 - 395.96] that is um that allows for anything to

[394.919 - 402.539] go

[395.96 - 405.71999999999997] celebrations opulence battles piracy

[402.539 - 407.699] Etc make sense all right so let's see

[405.72 - 409.56] what chat GPT says yes I understand what

[407.699 - 411.539] you're looking for it sounds like you

[409.56 - 412.8] want to create a sweeping epic story set

[411.539 - 414.539] during the height of the Roman Empire

[412.8 - 416.40000000000003] with a courtesan as the main character

[414.539 - 417.36] to help flesh out the story and

[416.4 - 418.79999999999995] characters we could start by

[417.36 - 420.84000000000003] brainstorming some ideas for the

[418.8 - 422.759] courtesan's background and motivations

[420.84 - 424.73999999999995] for example what was her life like

[422.759 - 426.24] before she became a courtesan what

[424.74 - 428.759] letter did that profession and what are

[426.24 - 431.40000000000003] her goals within it does she have any

[428.759 - 432.78000000000003] personal or professional relationships

[431.4 - 434.58] um let's see in terms of historical

[432.78 - 436.44] events the Reigns of Augustus and

[434.58 - 438.24] Hadrian would provide a rich backdrop as

[436.44 - 439.74] they were both significant figures and

[438.24 - 441.90000000000003] the rule coincided with a time of

[439.74 - 445.08] prosperity and expansion including

[441.9 - 447.17999999999995] events um could add to the historical

[445.08 - 449.46] reality okay cool is there anything

[447.18 - 452.46] specific you would like to include

[449.46 - 453.96] um okay great so

[452.46 - 459.35999999999996] um

[453.96 - 462.0] first let's brainstorm the MC a

[459.36 - 465.199] shorthand for main character

[462.0 - 469.02] um uh during another

[465.199 - 473.699] brainstorming session one idea was that

[469.02 - 477.539] she was a slave seeking Liberation uh

[473.699 - 481.62] but I'm not sure if that works

[477.539 - 484.62] um another idea was that she was from

[481.62 - 488.639] um a lower family

[484.62 - 491.22] um maybe uh I guess

[488.639 - 494.88] maybe a patrician

[491.22 - 495.78000000000003] um maybe a poor Patrician family I don't

[494.88 - 500.94] remember

[495.78 - 503.05999999999995] if the attritions were still around

[500.94 - 503.06] um

[503.46 - 514.26] so uh maybe let's brainstorm some around

[508.319 - 516.539] that can you uh give me some more ideas

[514.26 - 519.18] so one thing with chat GPT is you have

[516.539 - 520.56] to be very specific about what you ask

[519.18 - 522.9789999999999] for

[520.56 - 526.38] um whereas interacting with a human

[522.979 - 528.899] there's a lot of uh based on my recent

[526.38 - 530.58] interview with Anna Bernstein um which

[528.899 - 533.7] she pointed out that like with a human

[530.58 - 535.5] there's there's an implied intent

[533.7 - 537.36] um what with the machine you have to be

[535.5 - 539.279] very explicit

[537.36 - 540.72] um okay perhaps she was born into a poor

[539.279 - 542.1] Patrician family and was struggling to

[540.72 - 544.38] make ends meet she was forced to leave

[542.1 - 545.88] home at a young age make her way in the

[544.38 - 549.06] world she may have turned to courtesan

[545.88 - 549.899] work to earn a living

[549.06 - 552.779] um

[549.899 - 555.06] then her goal may be Beauty charm gained

[552.779 - 556.22] powerful uh gain the favor of powerful

[555.06 - 558.1199999999999] men and women

[556.22 - 559.44] alternatively she should have grown up

[558.12 - 561.42] she could have grown up in a wealthy

[559.44 - 562.8000000000001] family but fallen on hard times due to

[561.42 - 565.3199999999999] financial mismanagement political

[562.8 - 569.0999999999999] scheming oh that's good that's some good

[565.32 - 570.9590000000001] Intrigue oh yeah I like that and so

[569.1 - 572.94] here's where like just asking it to give

[570.959 - 575.0999999999999] me ideas and then I pay attention to

[572.94 - 578.22] what resonates with me and so then it

[575.1 - 579.839] follows my lead another possibility was

[578.22 - 582.899] orphaned and had to make her way on the

[579.839 - 584.519] streets that's not quite as interesting

[582.899 - 586.74] um you know like a Rags to Riches thing

[584.519 - 589.26] but since I want to do a palace Intrigue

[586.74 - 591.32] this this middle one looks good

[589.26 - 591.3199999999999] um

[591.74 - 596.399] yeah I like that middle one

[595.74 - 601.38] um

[596.399 - 603.839] of somewhat Fallen fortunes that's very

[601.38 - 608.22] consistent with

[603.839 - 613.019] um Palace Intrigue uh and also sets her

[608.22 - 617.82] up with a strong motivation for revenge

[613.019 - 618.42] and Justice and getting back to her

[617.82 - 621.899] um

[618.42 - 625.019] uh what's the word uh desire not desired

[621.899 - 626.339] um deserved station

[625.019 - 630.74] um

[626.339 - 635.4590000000001] okay so that's a powerful through line

[630.74 - 639.899] let's now think about the theme

[635.459 - 644.3599999999999] um of this story the universal truth can

[639.899 - 644.36] you help me Workshop that now

[645.899 - 650.399] um so I want to pause and and point out

[648.18 - 652.9799999999999] that like okay how did how do how do you

[650.399 - 656.94] as the person following along know what

[652.98 - 659.1] to do so I am following uh kind of my

[656.94 - 661.2600000000001] personal pattern of when I'm coming up

[659.1 - 664.0790000000001] with a new story so you start with a

[661.26 - 666.0] premise so premise is usually just the

[664.079 - 667.26] setting and the main character

[666.0 - 669.12] um that's like oh I've got this great

[667.26 - 671.519] idea for a story so setting in main

[669.12 - 673.62] character then you develop that main

[671.519 - 675.42] character and explore their interaction

[673.62 - 678.0600000000001] with the setting because there's three

[675.42 - 679.62] pillars of writing fiction and that is

[678.06 - 681.3599999999999] plot setting and character we'll get the

[679.62 - 682.92] plot in a little while hopefully that's

[681.36 - 685.74] where we'll end today

[682.92 - 686.9399999999999] but setting in character so character is

[685.74 - 688.2] the human

[686.94 - 689.8800000000001] um and then the setting is the world

[688.2 - 691.86] that they're in and

[689.88 - 693.899] um they're those are intrinsically

[691.86 - 696.0] intertwined

[693.899 - 698.64] um and then the the thing that guides

[696.0 - 701.22] the whole story the purpose of the story

[698.64 - 702.42] is like the beacon on the hill or the

[701.22 - 704.399] lighthouse that you're heading towards

[702.42 - 707.9399999999999] that is theme

[704.399 - 709.32] and so theme is the universal truth the

[707.94 - 711.6] universal

[709.32 - 714.779] um lesson that is in it and so

[711.6 - 717.0600000000001] in uh popular fiction lately

[714.779 - 719.399] um you might have remembered this uh it

[717.06 - 721.8599999999999] was vaguely popular uh movie called

[719.399 - 724.74] Avengers end game where this uh big

[721.86 - 727.5600000000001] purple dude named Thanos wants to erase

[724.74 - 730.26] half of Life uh in the universe so the

[727.56 - 733.14] theme there is the arbitrariness of

[730.26 - 735.6] catastrophe right storms will just kill

[733.14 - 738.38] at random plagues will kill at random

[735.6 - 741.5400000000001] volcanoes will kill at random Thanos

[738.38 - 743.88] represents that uh the cataclysm right

[741.54 - 747.12] he is the death blight of of

[743.88 - 748.92] um of just our existence

[747.12 - 750.899] um and so let's see what it says so

[748.92 - 752.579] because we have to figure out

[750.899 - 754.56] the theme

[752.579 - 757.019] um like why is it that I wanted to set

[754.56 - 758.76] this at the Golden Age of Rome and of

[757.019 - 760.32] these somewhat Fallen fortunes so let's

[758.76 - 762.36] see if we can figure out let's see if we

[760.32 - 764.88] can pull a theme out that is going to be

[762.36 - 767.04] the guiding force or The Guiding energy

[764.88 - 769.2] of this story

[767.04 - 770.2199999999999] um okay so to identify the theme it

[769.2 - 771.899] might be helpful to think about the

[770.22 - 773.5790000000001] central message or lesson you want your

[771.899 - 774.959] readers to take well duh that's what I'm

[773.579 - 776.6999999999999] asking

[774.959 - 779.04] um what is the main character struggling

[776.7 - 780.839] with and how does she overcome what does

[779.04 - 783.12] the main character learn about herself

[780.839 - 784.9200000000001] in the world uh as the story progresses

[783.12 - 786.8] what is the story saying about human

[784.92 - 788.76] nature or The Human Condition

[786.8 - 790.9799999999999] answering these questions can help you

[788.76 - 793.38] identify the underlying ideas or

[790.98 - 794.5790000000001] principles okay sure for example the

[793.38 - 795.899] main character is struggling with the

[794.579 - 798.5999999999999] challenges of living in a rigid

[795.899 - 799.68] hierarchical Society oh here we go we're

[798.6 - 802.26] getting into the good stuff here

[799.68 - 804.899] ultimately find able to find her place

[802.26 - 806.639] in it the theme of the story might be

[804.899 - 808.56] something like finding one owns one's

[806.639 - 810.9590000000001] own path in life or the power of

[808.56 - 811.9799999999999] self-determination on the other hand if

[810.959 - 814.8599999999999] the main character is struggling with

[811.98 - 816.54] issues of identity or belonging

[814.86 - 818.399] um the theme might be something like the

[816.54 - 821.279] search for one's true self or the

[818.399 - 823.2] importance of community okay so what

[821.279 - 826.86] this isn't what what this is implying

[823.2 - 830.1] here is that um a character's Arc their

[826.86 - 832.6800000000001] personal journey is is what exemplifies

[830.1 - 835.32] and carries the theme and so you can

[832.68 - 837.7199999999999] look you can often look at them as this

[835.32 - 840.24] is not always true but one of the

[837.72 - 841.74] easiest ways to do theme is what is it

[840.24 - 844.62] that they learn what is it that they

[841.74 - 847.5] overcome along the way now you can have

[844.62 - 849.42] a theme that does not directly impact a

[847.5 - 851.94] character's Arc and that and that the

[849.42 - 853.74] theme is actually in the setting so a

[851.94 - 857.1600000000001] good example of that is that one of the

[853.74 - 858.42] one of the the overarching themes in The

[857.16 - 861.06] Witcher

[858.42 - 862.62] um the Netflix show is one of nihilism

[861.06 - 865.38] and that is that everything is pointless

[862.62 - 867.66] and this is and that is put in the uh

[865.38 - 869.639] the world the setting the where the

[867.66 - 871.5] setting punishes people for having hope

[869.639 - 873.3] because that is the opposite of of

[871.5 - 876.54] nihilism right

[873.3 - 879.18] um and so geralt then is a reflection of

[876.54 - 881.3389999999999] the the world that he lives in but he

[879.18 - 883.56] kind of has a flat character Arc because

[881.339 - 885.839] he's just I know what the world is like

[883.56 - 887.2199999999999] and it's an awful place and I'm not

[885.839 - 888.899] gonna fight it

[887.22 - 890.399] um but his personal truth is that you

[888.899 - 891.72] can't fight Destiny

[890.399 - 892.74] um so that's you can have multiple

[891.72 - 894.6600000000001] themes

[892.74 - 896.88] okay great

[894.66 - 898.86] um so it did it it's it's framing it

[896.88 - 900.42] we're getting there but let's let's do

[898.86 - 903.0] this a little bit more

[900.42 - 905.279] um because it it one of the things that

[903.0 - 906.48] I don't like about chat GPT is that

[905.279 - 908.579] sometimes it'll just kind of tell you

[906.48 - 910.5] how to approach a problem rather than

[908.579 - 912.779] solving the problem now this is okay

[910.5 - 916.62] because sometimes just knowing what to

[912.779 - 918.06] do is is important but um sometimes I'm

[916.62 - 919.139] just like no just solve the problem for

[918.06 - 923.04] me

[919.139 - 924.42] um so I'll say let's think through this

[923.04 - 928.86] um let's think through this

[924.42 - 931.8] um uh let's see the setting

[928.86 - 934.86] is the um is the apogee

[931.8 - 938.279] of the Roman Empire

[934.86 - 942.1800000000001] what does that tell people

[938.279 - 944.82] there's an abundance of wealth and power

[942.18 - 948.3599999999999] and possibility

[944.82 - 950.4590000000001] um so that feels important

[948.36 - 952.44] and then

[950.459 - 957.4799999999999] um the MC

[952.44 - 959.82] uh has lost her station but wants it

[957.48 - 963.0600000000001] back

[959.82 - 964.98] um so again what does this

[963.06 - 969.8389999999999] um say about

[964.98 - 975.6] um Humanity or Universal truths

[969.839 - 978.12] um can you help me articulate this theme

[975.6 - 979.74] let's see what it says

[978.12 - 981.0600000000001] the setting of your story during the

[979.74 - 982.5600000000001] height of the Roman Empire suggests a

[981.06 - 984.42] time of great prosperity and opportunity

[982.56 - 986.459] but also time of strict social hierarchy

[984.42 - 988.3199999999999] and rigid rules of behavior

[986.459 - 989.5189999999999] this could be seen as a metaphor for the

[988.32 - 991.38] larger Human Experience where

[989.519 - 992.88] opportunities and limitations are often

[991.38 - 996.0] determined by factors such as birth

[992.88 - 998.04] wealth and status and gender the main

[996.0 - 999.779] characters struggle to regain her former

[998.04 - 1002.0] status in place in society could be seen

[999.779 - 1005.66] as a reflection of the human desire for

[1002.0 - 1007.16] recognition and respect ooh okay and the

[1005.66 - 1009.259] lengths that people will go to in order

[1007.16 - 1010.88] to achieve their goals this could be

[1009.259 - 1012.88] lead to a theme the pursuit of power and

[1010.88 - 1014.959] success or the cost of ambition

[1012.88 - 1016.579] alternatively the main character's

[1014.959 - 1019.6389999999999] Journey could be seen as a commentary on

[1016.579 - 1022.399] the capriciousness of Fate ouch

[1019.639 - 1025.16] um so capriciousness is um Mercurial

[1022.399 - 1028.699] emotions that's what capricious means is

[1025.16 - 1030.679] when when um something is very fickle

[1028.699 - 1032.419] um so the capriciousness of fate and the

[1030.679 - 1034.5790000000002] dangers of relying on external factors

[1032.419 - 1035.66] for one sense of worth and identity in

[1034.579 - 1037.28] this case the theme could be something

[1035.66 - 1039.5] like the fragility of success or the

[1037.28 - 1041.1789999999999] importance of self-acceptance I hope

[1039.5 - 1043.52] these ideas give you inspiration so this

[1041.179 - 1047.0590000000002] is actually zeroing in on what we had

[1043.52 - 1050.299] worked on before before Chad gbt

[1047.059 - 1054.559] um so let's do both actually

[1050.299 - 1056.66] let's have her pursue power

[1054.559 - 1059.24] um and status

[1056.66 - 1061.94] and then

[1059.24 - 1067.46] um when she gets it

[1061.94 - 1069.8600000000001] she realizes that she's alone hunted and

[1067.46 - 1071.059] uh and empty

[1069.86 - 1072.52] um

[1071.059 - 1076.7] so then

[1072.52 - 1079.84] she must make a choice

[1076.7 - 1084.919] um to let it all go and

[1079.84 - 1088.8799999999999] pursue uh genuine human connection

[1084.919 - 1093.6200000000001] I think this will parallel

[1088.88 - 1096.8600000000001] um today's Zeitgeist of uh

[1093.62 - 1100.1599999999999] quiet quitting and um

[1096.86 - 1101.12] and reclaiming our lives

[1100.16 - 1104.14] um

[1101.12 - 1104.1399999999999] what do you think

[1109.34 - 1112.52] okay it says I think that could be a

[1111.2 - 1113.72] powerful and resonant theme for your

[1112.52 - 1115.7] story having the main character

[1113.72 - 1117.44] initially pursue power and Status only

[1115.7 - 1120.0800000000002] to eventually realize the emptiness and

[1117.44 - 1121.52] isolation that comes with it could be a

[1120.08 - 1123.86] compelling Arc that reflects the idea of

[1121.52 - 1125.179] the cost of ambition this could be a

[1123.86 - 1126.6999999999998] great way to explore the theme of the

[1125.179 - 1129.02] importance of genuine human connection

[1126.7 - 1130.46] and the dangers of relying on external

[1129.02 - 1132.86] markers success for one sense of worth

[1130.46 - 1135.2] and fulfillment to further develop oh

[1132.86 - 1136.9399999999998] now it's suggesting stuff to further

[1135.2 - 1138.32] develop this theme you might consider

[1136.94 - 1140.299] exploring the main character's Journey

[1138.32 - 1142.28] from striving for external validation to

[1140.299 - 1144.5] finding a sense of purpose and meaning

[1142.28 - 1146.12] within herself this could involve

[1144.5 - 1148.1] showing her struggles with feelings of

[1146.12 - 1149.4799999999998] inadequacy or loneliness as well as

[1148.1 - 1151.1599999999999] moments of self-discovery and connection

[1149.48 - 1153.6200000000001] that help her to see the value of her

[1151.16 - 1158.0] own worth and relationships

[1153.62 - 1160.58] yes this is great I think we need to uh

[1158.0 - 1164.84] break this into a duology

[1160.58 - 1168.9189999999999] the first book will be called

[1164.84 - 1171.5] Ascension or something uh grandiose like

[1168.919 - 1174.2] that and the second

[1171.5 - 1177.38] book could be called

[1174.2 - 1178.66] um descent or something

[1177.38 - 1182.7800000000002] um

[1178.66 - 1184.3400000000001] and so I really like this and I'm

[1182.78 - 1186.3799999999999] totally gonna finish this and you guys

[1184.34 - 1188.6599999999999] are gonna go on this journey with me as

[1186.38 - 1190.5800000000002] however long it takes

[1188.66 - 1192.14] because this is a story I've wanted to

[1190.58 - 1194.12] write for a while but it's like I don't

[1192.14 - 1196.76] even know where to begin

[1194.12 - 1198.1999999999998] um because uh it's also because it's a

[1196.76 - 1199.8799999999999] historical fiction there's a lot of

[1198.2 - 1201.679] research that you need to do in order to

[1199.88 - 1203.2990000000002] keep it accurate

[1201.679 - 1205.52] um so like you know we haven't even

[1203.299 - 1208.28] explored dates and times of like you

[1205.52 - 1209.6] know uh Augustus or Marcus Aurelius or

[1208.28 - 1210.44] Hadrian

[1209.6 - 1211.9399999999998] um

[1210.44 - 1213.3200000000002] so we'll figure that out in a minute

[1211.94 - 1214.76] because we we do have to flesh out the

[1213.32 - 1215.36] setting

[1214.76 - 1220.22] um

[1215.36 - 1221.299] okay that's all nice and solid now

[1220.22 - 1224.419] um

[1221.299 - 1227.6] Let's uh

[1224.419 - 1232.22] let's summarize everything we've got up

[1227.6 - 1235.8799999999999] to this point please write a detailed uh

[1232.22 - 1237.08] summary of The Story So Far So you want

[1235.88 - 1238.64] to do this every now and then because

[1237.08 - 1240.1999999999998] especially when you're doing long form

[1238.64 - 1242.6000000000001] fiction

[1240.2 - 1244.64] um it it does chat GPT does have a

[1242.6 - 1246.86] limited memory so you want to you want

[1244.64 - 1249.0200000000002] to kind of like okay let's stop let's

[1246.86 - 1252.34] circle the wagons let's figure out

[1249.02 - 1252.34] exactly what's going on

[1254.66 - 1260.539] and see it got one thing wrong where

[1257.24 - 1262.16] it's um it says poor Patrician family

[1260.539 - 1264.26] um so we actually want to say that she

[1262.16 - 1266.5] started as a with a as a in a powerful

[1264.26 - 1266.5] family

[1267.26 - 1270.32] um through her beauty charm and wit the

[1268.88 - 1272.0] main character is able to gain the favor

[1270.32 - 1273.799] of powerful men and women and she Rises

[1272.0 - 1275.84] to position of influence

[1273.799 - 1277.7] however she becomes more successful she

[1275.84 - 1280.58] becomes she begins to realize the

[1277.7 - 1282.14] emptiness and isolation

[1280.58 - 1283.6399999999999] um yep she must ultimately make a choice

[1282.14 - 1285.14] between her ambition and genuine human

[1283.64 - 1286.88] connection

[1285.14 - 1289.5800000000002] um the first book titled Ascension

[1286.88 - 1291.74] follows the character's rise to power

[1289.58 - 1293.539] um the second book descent explores her

[1291.74 - 1295.22] journey from striving for external

[1293.539 - 1297.32] validation to finding a sense of purpose

[1295.22 - 1299.419] and meaning with herself as she grapples

[1297.32 - 1302.6] with the choices she has made and the

[1299.419 - 1307.5200000000002] consequences from them excellent

[1302.6 - 1309.9189999999999] um we just need to change one detail

[1307.52 - 1313.76] um she starts

[1309.919 - 1315.74] um or she was born to a powerful

[1313.76 - 1318.2] and so this is where I thought something

[1315.74 - 1320.179] and said something but didn't tell it

[1318.2 - 1325.82] um she was born to a powerful and

[1320.179 - 1330.14] Wealthy family uh but uh her family was

[1325.82 - 1333.5] um dispossessed uh due to uh betrayal

[1330.14 - 1337.8200000000002] and Palace intrigue

[1333.5 - 1339.1] can you update the summary based on this

[1337.82 - 1341.6589999999999] info

[1339.1 - 1342.799] excuse me um certainly here's an updated

[1341.659 - 1345.5] summary

[1342.799 - 1348.74] and so by getting it to restate it we

[1345.5 - 1350.9] can then see how the machine understands

[1348.74 - 1353.48] the story and this is the same thing as

[1350.9 - 1355.4] as we what we do with humans

[1353.48 - 1358.88] um which is called reflective listening

[1355.4 - 1361.7] so um I am asking it to reflect back to

[1358.88 - 1363.919] me what it understands that I want so

[1361.7 - 1366.02] using reflective listening with chat GPT

[1363.919 - 1368.179] is a really powerful technique I'm going

[1366.02 - 1371.12] to do a quick time check because

[1368.179 - 1372.26] um oh wow we're already 22 minutes in

[1371.12 - 1374.2399999999998] um I want to keep these videos

[1372.26 - 1376.76] reasonable

[1374.24 - 1378.86] um so we're we're we've got like the

[1376.76 - 1380.179] main through line we've got a little bit

[1378.86 - 1382.039] of the setting

[1380.179 - 1384.02] um so let's try and get a little bit

[1382.039 - 1386.419] further with the setting and then let's

[1384.02 - 1387.3799999999999] start trying to outline a plot

[1386.419 - 1391.1000000000001] um

[1387.38 - 1394.5800000000002] great let's flesh out the setting now

[1391.1 - 1398.48] um can you help me figure out when

[1394.58 - 1399.62] exactly to set this story when do you

[1398.48 - 1403.159] think

[1399.62 - 1406.1589999999999] um the Roman Empire hit its absolute

[1403.159 - 1406.159] Peak

[1410.24 - 1414.799] raging okay

[1412.34 - 1417.1999999999998] trajan was an effective ruler uh and

[1414.799 - 1419.36] popular ruler and he ruled for almost 20

[1417.2 - 1421.1000000000001] years okay so that's a that's a good

[1419.36 - 1422.059] period of time

[1421.1 - 1426.08] um

[1422.059 - 1428.48] so Augustus was earlier Hadrian came

[1426.08 - 1429.74] after oh let's do hatred let's do trajan

[1428.48 - 1431.48] to Hadrian

[1429.74 - 1432.98] um so her life takes place during the

[1431.48 - 1435.94] entirety

[1432.98 - 1435.94] um of these guys

[1437.12 - 1444.08] okay great

[1439.58 - 1445.539] um uh let's set this so that uh her

[1444.08 - 1449.1789999999999] birth

[1445.539 - 1453.02] coincides with the um

[1449.179 - 1454.0] Ascension of trajan

[1453.02 - 1459.62] um

[1454.0 - 1463.0] so uh so she's partly uh marked the

[1459.62 - 1463.0] Romans were very superstitious

[1466.88 - 1473.2990000000002] um

[1467.559 - 1475.58] as being tied to the fate of the emperor

[1473.299 - 1479.84] um so then

[1475.58 - 1481.58] so then her life goes

[1479.84 - 1485.08] um

[1481.58 - 1492.26] uh so then her her character Arc

[1485.08 - 1494.0] follows Rome through its absolute Peak

[1492.26 - 1495.82] and the beginning

[1494.0 - 1502.94] of the decline

[1495.82 - 1505.24] so her choices mirror that of Rome okay

[1502.94 - 1510.559] with this in mind

[1505.24 - 1514.159] can you list all the major events and

[1510.559 - 1518.299] people and uh well I get yeah events and

[1514.159 - 1523.46] people that we should think about from

[1518.299 - 1526.46] let's see 98 A.D to 138.

[1523.46 - 1526.46] 80.

[1526.7 - 1531.919] um

[1527.84 - 1533.72] this will help us figure out what uh

[1531.919 - 1535.64] beats later

[1533.72 - 1536.96] okay

[1535.64 - 1538.94] certainly here are some of the major

[1536.96 - 1541.82] events and people from the period of 98

[1538.94 - 1545.779] 80 to 30 138.80

[1541.82 - 1548.32] um so this is her 40-year life basically

[1545.779 - 1552.02] um and then we can have because you know

[1548.32 - 1554.26] during Roman times Roman matrons tended

[1552.02 - 1557.72] to live a lot longer than Roman men

[1554.26 - 1560.419] mostly due to uh conflict but not always

[1557.72 - 1563.6000000000001] because you also had much shorter life

[1560.419 - 1567.44] expectancies of of women in general due

[1563.6 - 1569.059] to death during childbirth but once a

[1567.44 - 1570.44] woman made it past childbearing years

[1569.059 - 1572.6589999999999] she was

[1570.44 - 1574.7] their life expectancy was pretty similar

[1572.659 - 1577.22] to that of today with the exception of

[1574.7 - 1578.059] like things like plagues happening

[1577.22 - 1580.88] um okay

[1578.059 - 1582.5] antonine wall the bar Cobo Revolt the

[1580.88 - 1585.14] Jewish Rebellion Ayah there's that one

[1582.5 - 1586.279] take takes place in Palestine

[1585.14 - 1588.2] um because one of the things that I

[1586.279 - 1589.4] thought of is if she's a if she's a

[1588.2 - 1591.32] courtesan

[1589.4 - 1592.88] then maybe she's attached to very

[1591.32 - 1594.26] powerful people and goes all over the

[1592.88 - 1596.6000000000001] Roman World which could be really

[1594.26 - 1600.14] interesting

[1596.6 - 1602.0] um yep okay so this is this is the the

[1600.14 - 1603.679] Roman parthian War so that's way out

[1602.0 - 1605.419] east

[1603.679 - 1607.52] um which is not yet now I Ran So there

[1605.419 - 1610.4] were there's lots of uh horses and stuff

[1607.52 - 1612.02] so because cushiel's Legacy is one of my

[1610.4 - 1614.24] favorite stories I'm thinking about like

[1612.02 - 1616.94] what if she goes on these Adventures to

[1614.24 - 1619.88] like save the Empire or something

[1616.94 - 1621.6200000000001] um and and this is how she gets powerful

[1619.88 - 1623.779] um and then she starts touring with with

[1621.62 - 1626.4189999999999] Hadrian or something

[1623.779 - 1627.559] um I really like this actually

[1626.419 - 1630.46] um okay

[1627.559 - 1630.46] so

[1631.039 - 1635.539] so these are just a few examples

[1634.279 - 1639.98] um

[1635.539 - 1641.12] let's focus on her earlier life for a

[1639.98 - 1643.88] minute

[1641.12 - 1650.6] um she would have

[1643.88 - 1653.5390000000002] been about 12 during 110 whoops 110 A.D

[1650.6 - 1655.1] um what happened around

[1653.539 - 1659.48] then

[1655.1 - 1664.84] um anything political or economic that

[1659.48 - 1664.84] we can base the fall of her family on

[1673.4 - 1676.7] okay so if it says like I don't know

[1675.32 - 1677.8999999999999] what's happening in your character's

[1676.7 - 1679.94] life

[1677.9 - 1682.1000000000001] um okay so it's confused I'm I'm

[1679.94 - 1684.26] actually asking for

[1682.1 - 1686.36] um real real events

[1684.26 - 1688.58] so I'm going to do a quick refresh this

[1686.36 - 1691.9399999999998] is a trick that I have you can interrupt

[1688.58 - 1693.6789999999999] it with a with a solid refresh and then

[1691.94 - 1696.38] um and then you can go and regenerate it

[1693.679 - 1697.1000000000001] I'm like no no no let's not do that

[1696.38 - 1700.8400000000001] um

[1697.1 - 1703.58] okay what was happening in Rome around

[1700.84 - 1705.6999999999998] 110 80.

[1703.58 - 1705.6999999999998] um

[1705.74 - 1712.52] I am mostly curious about political and

[1709.94 - 1717.76] economic events

[1712.52 - 1717.76] um in and around the Imperial City

[1718.52 - 1723.2] foreign

[1720.88 - 1726.3200000000002] if you're watching please add a cancel

[1723.2 - 1728.8400000000001] button because you you don't want the

[1726.32 - 1730.58] conversation to be polluted in fact if

[1728.84 - 1732.1999999999998] we could go back and delete the bad

[1730.58 - 1734.4189999999999] messages

[1732.2 - 1736.64] um and and clean it up as we go so if we

[1734.419 - 1738.5590000000002] can flag something to say remove this

[1736.64 - 1741.0800000000002] from the conversation that would be

[1738.559 - 1743.12] fantastic okay During the period around

[1741.08 - 1744.86] one uh was enjoying a time of relative

[1743.12 - 1747.1999999999998] peace and prosperity trajan was an

[1744.86 - 1749.0] effective and popular ruler there was

[1747.2 - 1751.46] likely a great deal of political and

[1749.0 - 1755.72] economical activity

[1751.46 - 1758.8400000000001] um let's see many public works okay the

[1755.72 - 1761.8990000000001] expansion of the city's Aqueduct system

[1758.84 - 1764.36] um oh okay sure let's go with that

[1761.899 - 1766.6399999999999] sure let's go with that um

[1764.36 - 1770.899] let's say the MC's

[1766.64 - 1774.919] um family was involved in um these Major

[1770.899 - 1777.799] Works they were sponsoring and

[1774.919 - 1778.46] um and organizing

[1777.799 - 1782.779] um

[1778.46 - 1783.98] big projects but uh wealthier

[1782.779 - 1787.299] um

[1783.98 - 1791.84] wealthier or more well-connected family

[1787.299 - 1796.34] wanted in because they were very

[1791.84 - 1799.1] um a very lucrative and high highly

[1796.34 - 1800.12] coveted projects

[1799.1 - 1805.1589999999999] um

[1800.12 - 1808.8799999999999] so let's imagine that um her family's

[1805.159 - 1809.419] Fall From Grace was

[1808.88 - 1812.8990000000001] um

[1809.419 - 1815.0200000000002] was part of that scheme

[1812.899 - 1815.02] um

[1815.179 - 1823.3600000000001] let's go ahead and name these families

[1818.779 - 1828.32] and people can you recommend some uh

[1823.36 - 1830.86] clan names and uh given names for our

[1828.32 - 1830.86] characters

[1831.74 - 1836.059] um

[1832.48 - 1838.34] we need at least the MC

[1836.059 - 1843.1] her family name

[1838.34 - 1843.1] um and then the Rival faction name

[1843.44 - 1846.679] well certainly here are a few

[1845.12 - 1848.7199999999998] suggestions for clan names and given

[1846.679 - 1850.5800000000002] names you might use plant names Claudius

[1848.72 - 1852.14] this was a common clan name in agent

[1850.58 - 1854.6] Rome and it was associated with several

[1852.14 - 1855.919] influential families flavius this was

[1854.6 - 1859.039] another one

[1855.919 - 1861.5590000000002] um Aurelius so the claudians and the

[1859.039 - 1864.02] flavians these are uh

[1861.559 - 1865.46] I don't want to be necessarily that on

[1864.02 - 1866.72] the nose

[1865.46 - 1869.659] um

[1866.72 - 1871.82] and I'm not going to name her her Marcus

[1869.659 - 1875.8990000000001] um we need we need a female's names but

[1871.82 - 1878.1789999999999] uh Valerius or Aurelius or I mean yeah

[1875.899 - 1880.299] these are these are good

[1878.179 - 1880.299] um

[1881.559 - 1889.34] okay what about uh women's

[1886.159 - 1890.179] names remember the

[1889.34 - 1893.779] um

[1890.179 - 1895.64] the MC is a courtesan

[1893.779 - 1897.559] um so one thing that I that I noticed is

[1895.64 - 1899.659] that you have to sometimes remind chat

[1897.559 - 1901.1589999999999] GPT because it's like it'll kind of

[1899.659 - 1903.2600000000002] start going down its own rabbit hole and

[1901.159 - 1904.88] you have to pull it back and say no this

[1903.26 - 1906.559] is what we're doing

[1904.88 - 1913.0] um

[1906.559 - 1913.0] Let's uh let's get some women's names

[1916.94 - 1923.539] Julia so my fiance pointed out that um

[1920.96 - 1926.059] one thing that a lot of Roman homes did

[1923.539 - 1928.1] was that they just gave the women the

[1926.059 - 1930.1399999999999] feminized version so you see Julia

[1928.1 - 1932.48] Flavia Aurelia

[1930.14 - 1936.38] um so they were very super uncreative

[1932.48 - 1938.44] when it came to uh women's names

[1936.38 - 1938.44] um

[1942.039 - 1949.279] so we could do something like Aurelia

[1945.279 - 1951.46] Aurelius or Aurelia flavius I don't know

[1949.279 - 1951.46] um

[1951.5 - 1956.6] uh let's see so uh female names were

[1955.34 - 1960.62] often

[1956.6 - 1964.58] um just feminine uh versions of house

[1960.62 - 1968.84] names are there any other kinds of names

[1964.58 - 1970.46] we can choose something more distinctive

[1968.84 - 1973.4599999999998] Maybe

[1970.46 - 1973.46] foreign

[1979.0 - 1983.36] now this is something that I happen to

[1981.14 - 1984.98] know already so if you didn't know this

[1983.36 - 1987.6789999999999] you could have asked that question like

[1984.98 - 1990.38] why are why are the names weird

[1987.679 - 1993.3200000000002] um let's see symprio simpronia

[1990.38 - 1996.14] this was an uncommon given name

[1993.32 - 2001.0] um associated with uh sister of Cato the

[1996.14 - 2002.679] younger interesting tortulo sytheris

[2001.0 - 2005.08] or kytheris I don't know if that would

[2002.679 - 2006.3400000000001] be cythrus or kytheris

[2005.08 - 2008.019] um

[2006.34 - 2010.899] I want something that's not too

[2008.019 - 2014.38] difficult to say so Cornelia

[2010.899 - 2017.86] mother of the graci brothers

[2014.38 - 2021.46] so let's say like Cornelia flavius or

[2017.86 - 2022.4189999999999] something or Valerius Cornelia Valerius

[2021.46 - 2025.38] um

[2022.419 - 2030.3990000000001] would Cornelia

[2025.38 - 2032.94] Valerius be a legit name anything wrong

[2030.399 - 2032.9399999999998] with that

[2038.5 - 2041.94] father or husband okay

[2043.84 - 2051.339] in the genitive case and it would be uh

[2048.46 - 2053.2] valyria

[2051.339 - 2057.54] so I guess her name would be Cornelia

[2053.2 - 2057.54] valyria or Cornelia of the valyria

[2060.58 - 2064.659] Okay blah blah so it's telling me what's

[2062.74 - 2066.8199999999997] wrong with it for example it's common

[2064.659 - 2068.679] for Roman names to be comprised of a

[2066.82 - 2070.96] given name a clan name and sometimes a

[2068.679 - 2073.659] cognomen a nickname or additional

[2070.96 - 2075.659] surname that's right

[2073.659 - 2075.659] um

[2076.0 - 2080.08] um so with the given name coming first

[2078.46 - 2081.52] followed by the clan name followed by

[2080.08 - 2083.56] the cognomen

[2081.52 - 2086.08] good so I didn't even have to ask it

[2083.56 - 2089.619] realized that I was struggling

[2086.08 - 2090.52] um okay help me understand

[2089.619 - 2093.2400000000002] um

[2090.52 - 2097.119] what the genitive

[2093.24 - 2099.18] genitive case means

[2097.119 - 2099.1800000000003] um

[2099.58 - 2106.14] the Leary eye looks plural

[2104.32 - 2108.5800000000004] I'm lost

[2106.14 - 2111.0989999999997] in Latin the genitive cases used to

[2108.58 - 2114.2799999999997] indicate possession or ownership in

[2111.099 - 2116.7000000000003] English we use uh the possessive form of

[2114.28 - 2116.7000000000003] a noun

[2118.96 - 2123.16] um genitive cases often indicated by so

[2120.94 - 2124.96] it knows a lot about Latin

[2123.16 - 2126.22] um I've seen a lot of people so while

[2124.96 - 2129.28] it's writing I've seen a lot of people

[2126.22 - 2131.5] talking about how large language models

[2129.28 - 2133.78] don't have mental models of the world

[2131.5 - 2135.94] and I completely disagree this is

[2133.78 - 2138.28] explaining Latin to me and it not only

[2135.94 - 2141.52] that it intuited that I needed to learn

[2138.28 - 2145.119] Latin so please explain to me how it's

[2141.52 - 2147.94] doing this without internal models you

[2145.119 - 2150.9] can't trust me I have a bookcase full of

[2147.94 - 2150.9] Neuroscience over there

[2151.359 - 2156.339] okay let me do a quick time check we are

[2153.88 - 2157.9] at 35 minutes we'll try and wrap this up

[2156.339 - 2158.619] pretty quick

[2157.9 - 2161.8] um

[2158.619 - 2164.38] okay great please summarize everything

[2161.8 - 2167.5600000000004] up to this point

[2164.38 - 2170.7400000000002] um uh everything let's say uh everything

[2167.56 - 2173.0789999999997] about the story up to this point

[2170.74 - 2175.18] um you can ignore the sidebar

[2173.079 - 2177.3] conversations

[2175.18 - 2177.2999999999997] um

[2178.02 - 2183.04] let's go ahead and

[2181.0 - 2183.76] um so for example

[2187.24 - 2191.4399999999996] second declension nouns like Valerius I

[2189.76 - 2193.0] don't even um I'm not going to learn

[2191.44 - 2194.68] that much about Latin right now but I

[2193.0 - 2196.3] guess I'm going to

[2287.099 - 2294.88] participating in the grand public works

[2315.7 - 2319.839] um so again by asking it to restate

[2317.74 - 2321.9399999999996] things it kind of says okay the document

[2319.839 - 2323.14] is written here

[2321.94 - 2325.78] um

[2323.14 - 2327.7] and it's I confused it again

[2325.78 - 2329.619] um by because it says oh it's it's set

[2327.7 - 2331.66] in in one 1080.

[2329.619 - 2334.8] um

[2331.66 - 2334.7999999999997] uh let's see

[2355.839 - 2359.92] what I mean is like okay I could

[2358.18 - 2361.66] probably reword this but like this is

[2359.92 - 2363.78] good enough

[2361.66 - 2363.7799999999997] um

[2377.32 - 2381.88] I really like this as a as a backstory

[2379.66 - 2384.5789999999997] because it gives her a very very complex

[2381.88 - 2388.079] set of motivations and

[2384.579 - 2388.079] um let's say baggage to work through

[2388.359 - 2392.56] um but yeah I think we'll call this a
