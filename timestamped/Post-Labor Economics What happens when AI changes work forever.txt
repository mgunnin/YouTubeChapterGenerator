[0.24 - 5.58] hello everybody David Shapiro here with

[2.7 - 8.04] a brand new video today's video by

[5.58 - 11.639] popular demand is about post-labor

[8.04 - 13.799] economics what happens when AI changes

[11.639 - 15.54] work forever

[13.799 - 17.16] real quick before we jump into the show

[15.54 - 19.439999999999998] I just want to plug my patreon real

[17.16 - 22.259999999999998] quick I have a private Discord server

[19.44 - 24.66] for all patreon supporters and I do also

[22.26 - 26.82] have several other Discord servers that

[24.66 - 28.740000000000002] I am a part of one is the gato community

[26.82 - 30.9] and the other is the cognitive AI lab

[28.74 - 33.42] Discord which I started at the beginning

[30.9 - 34.68] of my YouTube career so anyways hop on

[33.42 - 36.059000000000005] over to patreon if you want to support

[34.68 - 38.219] me get involved in the private

[36.059 - 40.28] conversations I also have a few higher

[38.219 - 43.64] tier slots available where I have

[40.28 - 48.660000000000004] exclusive access one-on-ones group Chats

[43.64 - 50.34] on patreon and on um calendly so on with

[48.66 - 52.31999999999999] the show

[50.34 - 53.940000000000005] in order to talk about post labor

[52.32 - 55.739] economics we need to start by talking

[53.94 - 57.419999999999995] about the history of labor-based

[55.739 - 60.36] Economics for the majority of human

[57.42 - 62.039] history human labor and our energetic

[60.36 - 63.899] output the physical force that we can

[62.039 - 68.04] apply on the world has been the biggest

[63.899 - 69.6] driver of productivity this was 100 True

[68.04 - 72.119] for our oldest ancestors

[69.6 - 74.28] hunter-gatherers who had not yet figured

[72.119 - 76.619] out how to harness energy and nature or

[74.28 - 80.52] the energy of animals it became slightly

[76.619 - 82.5] less true for our agrarian ancestors as

[80.52 - 85.38] they started to use draft animals such

[82.5 - 88.08] as Horses and Ox as well as basic

[85.38 - 90.119] machines like water wheels and levers

[88.08 - 93.29899999999999] and carts now granted a lever and a cart

[90.119 - 95.159] don't actually add energy to the

[93.299 - 97.2] equation but they do allow you to

[95.159 - 99.60000000000001] multiply your own Force

[97.2 - 100.979] the Industrial Revolution happened which

[99.6 - 102.479] of course everyone talks about that

[100.979 - 104.759] because we're in the midst of the fourth

[102.479 - 106.979] Industrial Revolution was primarily

[104.759 - 109.799] about Force amplification or Force

[106.979 - 111.53999999999999] multiplication so in other words we

[109.799 - 114.06] started inventing machines that could

[111.54 - 117.18] use thermal energy from various fuel

[114.06 - 119.93900000000001] sources such as coal and oil and they

[117.18 - 122.399] were able to Output more energy or more

[119.939 - 124.86] work than we could with just our muscles

[122.399 - 126.18] and certainly more than even large

[124.86 - 128.52] animals could

[126.18 - 130.739] another advantage of machines is that

[128.52 - 134.22] they could metabolize fuel at a far

[130.739 - 136.739] higher rate so say for instance a gallon

[134.22 - 139.739] of gasoline a gallon of gasoline has

[136.739 - 142.52] about 31 000 calories of energy in it

[139.739 - 145.379] which is about how much I eat in 10 days

[142.52 - 147.84] but a large machine can use that gallon

[145.379 - 149.51999999999998] of gasoline in a matter of minutes or

[147.84 - 151.98] hours depending on what that machine is

[149.52 - 154.26000000000002] doing such as if it's a large tractor or

[151.98 - 157.26] combine that's being used to manage a

[154.26 - 159.959] farm for instance and so not just a mat

[157.26 - 162.26] the amount of work that can be done but

[159.959 - 166.019] the amount of energy that can be used

[162.26 - 169.019] was the big game changing factor for the

[166.019 - 170.81900000000002] Industrial Revolution but as everyone

[169.019 - 173.4] knows a tractor is not particularly

[170.819 - 175.2] smart it pulls something it's not any

[173.4 - 178.68] different than what a human can do or an

[175.2 - 182.64] ox it's just bigger faster and stronger

[178.68 - 185.04000000000002] so that is where uh the industrial

[182.64 - 187.85999999999999] Revelation Revolution sorry Revelation

[185.04 - 190.019] the Industrial Revolution changed

[187.86 - 191.70000000000002] labor-based Econo economics but you

[190.019 - 194.22] still needed an intelligent human

[191.7 - 196.98] driving that tractor

[194.22 - 200.099] now the industrial revolution of course

[196.98 - 203.34] is a Marvel of mechanical engineering

[200.099 - 205.5] metal metal Sciences electronics and so

[203.34 - 208.14000000000001] on but one thing that we need to point

[205.5 - 210.84] out that is critical is that it all

[208.14 - 212.819] still comes down to the application and

[210.84 - 215.64000000000001] use of energy

[212.819 - 218.45899999999997] so human population growth over the last

[215.64 - 220.67999999999998] two centuries has been tied directly to

[218.459 - 223.26] the amount of energy we had access to

[220.68 - 225.239] because that also is directly correlated

[223.26 - 227.879] to the amount of food we can produce the

[225.239 - 231.019] amount of water we can um transport and

[227.879 - 234.599] clean and drink and so

[231.019 - 238.08] basically uh what I want to do here is

[234.599 - 239.819] point out that yes labor is about what

[238.08 - 241.37900000000002] humans can do with our hands our bodies

[239.819 - 244.44] and what we can do with the use of

[241.379 - 248.159] machines but we're also still completely

[244.44 - 249.9] dependent upon the underlying sources of

[248.159 - 252.29899999999998] energy so this is an important thing to

[249.9 - 255.54] keep in mind

[252.299 - 257.519] in the long history of labor and moving

[255.54 - 259.62] up through to today there's a few basic

[257.519 - 261.479] kinds of Labor and of course I'm not

[259.62 - 265.02] going to get into every little Nuance or

[261.479 - 267.71999999999997] detail but there's three overarching

[265.02 - 270.29999999999995] categories of Labor so first is manual

[267.72 - 273.96000000000004] unskilled labor this includes moving

[270.3 - 276.54] heavy things using your hands and body

[273.96 - 278.28] uh that doesn't basically something that

[276.54 - 280.02000000000004] you can pick up in an afternoon

[278.28 - 282.0] so for instance one of the jobs that I

[280.02 - 284.46] had when I was much younger was I was

[282.0 - 286.44] restocking the shelves at a pet store at

[284.46 - 288.59999999999997] night didn't take a whole lot of brains

[286.44 - 291.24] took a lot of muscles moving heavy

[288.6 - 293.04] things put here you know object a in

[291.24 - 295.5] place B repeat

[293.04 - 298.44] then the next level above that is

[295.5 - 299.699] skilled labor so this is crafts such as

[298.44 - 302.88] carpentry

[299.699 - 305.28000000000003] um electrical work Plumbing that sort of

[302.88 - 306.65999999999997] thing this also could include uh

[305.28 - 308.34] hospitality and food service because

[306.66 - 310.62] it's still very kinetic it's still very

[308.34 - 312.59999999999997] much oriented in your body but these are

[310.62 - 315.84000000000003] things that require training some of

[312.6 - 317.699] them require certification but they one

[315.84 - 320.4] thing that they all almost always have

[317.699 - 322.979] in common is that it requires you to use

[320.4 - 327.29999999999995] tools and materials when you're doing

[322.979 - 329.34] skilled labor now there are jobs such as

[327.3 - 333.06] being a doctor or a nurse that are also

[329.34 - 335.15999999999997] very kinetic but those uh require years

[333.06 - 337.44] and years and years of training and

[335.16 - 339.90000000000003] certification and so those

[337.44 - 341.82] um while they are still embodied work

[339.9 - 344.58] um they are still professions or

[341.82 - 347.15999999999997] knowledge work and so then that leads to

[344.58 - 349.62] the third category which is professional

[347.16 - 351.41900000000004] labor or knowledge work which includes

[349.62 - 353.34000000000003] things like Architects lawyers doctors

[351.419 - 355.19899999999996] things that you do on computers even

[353.34 - 357.13899999999995] being an influencer technically could be

[355.199 - 359.46000000000004] considered a profession

[357.139 - 362.40000000000003] depending on the kind of influencer you

[359.46 - 364.919] are right but one rule of thumb is that

[362.4 - 366.419] you do it in a desk or in an office or

[364.919 - 368.639] in front of a computer and again this is

[366.419 - 371.4] not always true key example being

[368.639 - 373.86] medical professionals who many of whom

[371.4 - 375.539] interact with people all day every day

[373.86 - 379.38] and it requires a tremendous amount of

[375.539 - 381.59999999999997] training excuse me ditto for uh for uh

[379.38 - 383.28] trial lawyers right trial lawyers have

[381.6 - 385.5] to do a lot of office work but they also

[383.28 - 388.67999999999995] have to go to trial to go to court

[385.5 - 390.9] before judges and so on magistrates

[388.68 - 392.639] so one thing that I need to point out

[390.9 - 394.979] though is that we have transitioned

[392.639 - 396.539] largely from a unskilled labor and

[394.979 - 398.039] skilled labor economy to a

[396.539 - 400.139] knowledge-based economy or a

[398.039 - 402.78] services-based economy

[400.139 - 404.88] so this is one of my favorite graphs of

[402.78 - 407.34] all time and many people are shocked

[404.88 - 409.62] when I tell them about this so there's a

[407.34 - 412.19899999999996] few things to unpack here so there's a

[409.62 - 415.08] couple of trend lines this solid green

[412.199 - 418.259] trend line is the agricultural uh share

[415.08 - 422.639] of total employment so basically what

[418.259 - 426.3] has happened is that as uh as time has

[422.639 - 430.139] progressed the number of farm jobs has

[426.3 - 432.84000000000003] collapsed to around two percent of total

[430.139 - 436.139] employment and it was much much much

[432.84 - 437.81899999999996] higher this was if I'm reading this

[436.139 - 440.88] correctly I believe it was over 30

[437.819 - 443.099] percent just over 100 years ago so from

[440.88 - 445.68] 30 percent of jobs were farm jobs to

[443.099 - 448.08] around two percent and then this dotted

[445.68 - 449.34000000000003] green axis is non-agricultural

[448.08 - 451.68] employment

[449.34 - 453.35999999999996] the left axis

[451.68 - 456.78000000000003] um all right right Axis so that's this

[453.36 - 461.46000000000004] is percentage yes and then the left axis

[456.78 - 464.21999999999997] is over here so the total uh number of

[461.46 - 467.52] employees that were not uh Farm

[464.22 - 469.199] employees has gone up from around 20

[467.52 - 470.639] million now also keep in mind that the

[469.199 - 473.94] population was growing at the same time

[470.639 - 476.36] but from 20 million to over 140 million

[473.94 - 478.8] non-farm jobs and then finally

[476.36 - 481.759] agriculture employment

[478.8 - 485.039] um has collapsed from around

[481.759 - 488.28000000000003] uh let's say about 10 to 12 million jobs

[485.039 - 491.46] total to almost non-existent in terms of

[488.28 - 494.88] total number of employees so this shows

[491.46 - 497.06] how just a single sector farming has

[494.88 - 499.379] completely been changed over the years

[497.06 - 503.18] largely just due to Industrial

[499.379 - 506.22] Automation through tractors combines and

[503.18 - 508.379] economies of scale with mechanized

[506.22 - 511.379] farming and this is just one sector so

[508.379 - 514.08] what people are hoping is that

[511.379 - 516.419] today all the service jobs that we all

[514.08 - 518.279] hate all the all the BS jobs the desk

[516.419 - 520.5] jobs that we hate today are going to

[518.279 - 522.539] follow this trend line the way that

[520.5 - 523.919] Farms have jobs have gone but then

[522.539 - 525.66] there's going to be entirely new

[523.919 - 528.959] categories of jobs

[525.66 - 530.76] that come up now as many of you know I'm

[528.959 - 532.7399999999999] rather skeptical of this

[530.76 - 535.019] um certainly it would be an interesting

[532.74 - 536.64] future if there's entirely if there's

[535.019 - 539.94] millions and millions or even billions

[536.64 - 541.56] of new jobs created by AI I am skeptical

[539.94 - 544.08] that this is going to be the outcome and

[541.56 - 546.4799999999999] let me tell you why

[544.08 - 549.72] knowledge work or service sector jobs

[546.48 - 553.5] are uh rooted in what's called cognitive

[549.72 - 556.08] labor or knowledge work so as farm jobs

[553.5 - 558.72] have been crashing knowledge work has

[556.08 - 561.48] been rising so the majority of work

[558.72 - 565.399] today is knowledge work or cognitive

[561.48 - 568.14] labor this could also be argue arguably

[565.399 - 570.36] included emotional labor so emotional

[568.14 - 571.74] labor is a form of cognitive labor that

[570.36 - 573.6] is more common in nurturing and

[571.74 - 576.6800000000001] caregiving roles

[573.6 - 580.019] tools like chat GPT and its successors

[576.68 - 583.019] are going to continue to invade the

[580.019 - 585.839] domain of cognitive labor so we've

[583.019 - 588.12] already seen some examples of chat GPT

[585.839 - 590.48] used for tutoring used for medical

[588.12 - 593.7] advice used for relationship advice

[590.48 - 597.24] people have even automated companies you

[593.7 - 599.7] know the automatic CEO thing so it is

[597.24 - 603.0600000000001] pretty obvious to everyone by now that

[599.7 - 606.24] these models that chat GPT gpt4 and so

[603.06 - 608.04] on are capable of cognitive labor it

[606.24 - 611.16] would be pretty silly to assume that

[608.04 - 614.04] this does not continue so that leaves

[611.16 - 616.56] physical labor skilled labor unskilled

[614.04 - 618.8389999999999] labor and cognitive later labor but if

[616.56 - 621.779] AI is invading cognitive labor first

[618.839 - 625.74] what are we gonna do

[621.779 - 627.8389999999999] we go back to manual labor do we all

[625.74 - 630.0600000000001] pick up arts and crafts and others

[627.839 - 632.7600000000001] semi-skilled and skilled labor

[630.06 - 633.8389999999999] you know it's not necessarily what I

[632.76 - 638.279] want to do

[633.839 - 642.019] right if there is a a future state where

[638.279 - 644.7] I'm not going to get paid by anyone but

[642.019 - 646.38] an AI is going to come through and you

[644.7 - 648.72] know basically take my YouTube gig from

[646.38 - 651.06] me right like I don't want to go back to

[648.72 - 652.26] shoveling dirt and anyways there's

[651.06 - 654.4799999999999] machines that are better at it than

[652.26 - 655.92] humans so why would I do that so when

[654.48 - 658.0790000000001] you when you look at those three

[655.92 - 660.42] categories skilled unskilled and

[658.079 - 662.16] cognitive labor and you say okay well

[660.42 - 664.26] machines are better stronger and faster

[662.16 - 666.48] and cheaper at all of those than humans

[664.26 - 667.92] and they're only getting better that

[666.48 - 670.9200000000001] leaves the question what are we going to

[667.92 - 673.68] do so as I was trying to figure out like

[670.92 - 676.4399999999999] just trying to find a way to do this

[673.68 - 679.38] it occurred to me that looking at this

[676.44 - 681.72] from supply side or capability of AI

[679.38 - 684.06] versus Humans might not be the right way

[681.72 - 687.12] to look at it so there's the other way

[684.06 - 689.76] to look at it is demand side so what

[687.12 - 692.279] kind of jobs will people demand or want

[689.76 - 695.399] humans to have specifically

[692.279 - 697.8] in many cases you might want a you might

[695.399 - 700.26] always prefer to have a human doing

[697.8 - 703.019] something like Child Care Hospitality

[700.26 - 705.06] sorry hospitality jobs and other

[703.019 - 707.1] performance oriented things such as

[705.06 - 709.68] influencers right I don't know about you

[707.1 - 712.2] but every time I find a video that has

[709.68 - 714.959] you know an AI face AI voice

[712.2 - 717.3000000000001] I click off of it I don't want you know

[714.959 - 719.399] smoke and mirror I don't want to be

[717.3 - 722.279] lectured at by a sock puppet I want to

[719.399 - 724.8] see a real human I want to see their uh

[722.279 - 726.12] facial expression their intonation and I

[724.8 - 727.5] want to develop a parasocial

[726.12 - 729.0600000000001] relationship with the people that I

[727.5 - 731.399] follow and so a parasocial relationship

[729.06 - 734.459] is what most of you have with me where

[731.399 - 736.98] you have in your mind a model of me and

[734.459 - 739.8] like you kind of understand where I'm

[736.98 - 741.72] coming from right uh even though I might

[739.8 - 743.579] not know necessarily know all of you I

[741.72 - 747.12] in fact I don't know most of you

[743.579 - 749.3389999999999] but the uh the desire for that

[747.12 - 750.899] parasocial relationship for that

[749.339 - 753.1800000000001] um that that connection that human

[750.899 - 755.399] connection is something that I suspect

[753.18 - 757.26] that most humans are gonna want no

[755.399 - 759.12] matter how good AI gets now that being

[757.26 - 760.26] said there are probably going to be

[759.12 - 761.82] people that are like you know what I

[760.26 - 762.959] don't really care about people I you

[761.82 - 766.2] know just give me the information just

[762.959 - 768.7199999999999] give me the entertainment that's fine

[766.2 - 771.0] so this leads one final question will

[768.72 - 773.82] there be enough of those human exclusive

[771.0 - 777.12] jobs to go around I don't think there

[773.82 - 778.8000000000001] will be uh sure we might be able to have

[777.12 - 780.9590000000001] some Back to Basics moments where it's

[778.8 - 782.579] like oh hey you know maybe we can spend

[780.959 - 783.899] more time with our families maybe we can

[782.579 - 786.3599999999999] spend more time with child care and

[783.899 - 788.339] education that's not enough to drive the

[786.36 - 790.139] whole economy and it's certainly not

[788.339 - 792.7790000000001] enough I don't think for everyone to

[790.139 - 794.4590000000001] have a meaningful career especially if

[792.779 - 795.899] your interests lie elsewhere that just

[794.459 - 797.3389999999999] doesn't sound good

[795.899 - 800.579] so

[797.339 - 803.5790000000001] now I will introduce you to what I call

[800.579 - 807.12] Post labor economics and I apologize for

[803.579 - 808.8599999999999] the wall of text on this uh slide but I

[807.12 - 810.779] figured just a list you can pause it and

[808.86 - 812.82] read it in much greater detail if you'd

[810.779 - 814.74] like but I'll just go uh just read the

[812.82 - 817.019] bullet points at the high level so

[814.74 - 818.88] automation dominance this is the idea

[817.019 - 821.04] that Automation in the form of Robotics

[818.88 - 822.6] Ai and other kinds of automation is

[821.04 - 824.459] going to take over including for

[822.6 - 826.62] cognitive labor

[824.459 - 828.7199999999999] the second aspect of post-labor

[826.62 - 831.72] Economics is the decreased economic

[828.72 - 833.399] value of human labor basically humans

[831.72 - 835.139] can't compete on an economic scale to

[833.399 - 836.519] tractors why do you expect that humans

[835.139 - 838.98] are going to get be able to compete on

[836.519 - 840.48] an economic scale to AI as its

[838.98 - 843.54] intelligence ramps up

[840.48 - 845.22] number three another criteria or uh

[843.54 - 846.899] characteristic of post-labor Economics

[845.22 - 848.88] is that we will probably see

[846.899 - 851.279] redistributive policies so

[848.88 - 852.8389999999999] redistribution is not necessarily a

[851.279 - 854.88] collective ownership I'm not advocating

[852.839 - 856.86] for socialism basically all I'm

[854.88 - 859.38] advocating for is some form of universal

[856.86 - 860.639] basic income or reverse income tax or

[859.38 - 863.519] that kind of thing

[860.639 - 866.519] or negative income tax sorry ownership

[863.519 - 868.079] shifts so this is where this is the

[866.519 - 870.12] closest thing to Socialism or Marxism

[868.079 - 872.459] that I will ever talk about

[870.12 - 874.68] um because I I do not believe in central

[872.459 - 876.4799999999999] management of the economy I don't think

[874.68 - 878.6999999999999] that it's a good idea

[876.48 - 881.88] um I do believe in kind of the wisdom of

[878.7 - 884.639] of Market forces but what I do

[881.88 - 886.68] anticipate is that the ownership class

[884.639 - 889.26] might shift and we might shift more

[886.68 - 891.0] towards decentralized ownership models

[889.26 - 893.04] or Collective ownership models such as

[891.0 - 894.42] co-ops and this is not something that I

[893.04 - 898.199] invented these are things that exist

[894.42 - 900.4799999999999] today but with the aid of AI it might be

[898.199 - 903.019] easier for ordinary people to band

[900.48 - 905.1] together to collectively buy

[903.019 - 907.44] resources property and other capital

[905.1 - 909.86] goods that allow them to be to

[907.44 - 912.0] participate in the means of production

[909.86 - 913.1990000000001] now I'm not going to say that this is

[912.0 - 916.38] going to totally replace all

[913.199 - 917.639] corporations but if we can stick The

[916.38 - 919.56] Landing with Technologies like

[917.639 - 920.639] blockchain and decentralized autonomous

[919.56 - 923.4799999999999] organizations

[920.639 - 926.639] then we can have expert you know AI CEOs

[923.48 - 930.36] managing our resources for us another

[926.639 - 932.699] component of post labor economics I

[930.36 - 935.279] suspect will be price deflation and so

[932.699 - 937.68] what I mean by this is that

[935.279 - 939.959] as AI gets better at producing more

[937.68 - 941.519] goods and services the marginal cost of

[939.959 - 942.959] those goods and services is going to

[941.519 - 945.0600000000001] collapse and it's not all goods and

[942.959 - 947.0999999999999] services some things are going to remain

[945.06 - 948.779] expensive or at least more expensive

[947.1 - 950.16] than others but other things are going

[948.779 - 952.86] to get very very cheap and I'll go into

[950.16 - 954.959] some details in just a moment we're also

[952.86 - 958.0790000000001] going to need new economic indicators so

[954.959 - 960.18] what I mean by this is that GDP sorry

[958.079 - 962.12] GDP and employment rates I tried to say

[960.18 - 964.1389999999999] both of those at the same time

[962.12 - 966.24] unemployment rates are not going to be

[964.139 - 969.0] quite as meaningful in the future as

[966.24 - 970.6800000000001] they are today right now total

[969.0 - 972.06] employment and unemployment rates are

[970.68 - 974.399] really important indicators for how well

[972.06 - 976.9799999999999] the economy is doing but in a post-labor

[974.399 - 979.5] economy employment rate won't matter as

[976.98 - 981.54] much so we might need other other

[979.5 - 984.18] metrics in order to measure how well the

[981.54 - 985.4399999999999] economy is doing there's probably also

[984.18 - 986.519] going to be changes in consumption

[985.44 - 988.44] patterns

[986.519 - 990.6] so for instance we're going to have more

[988.44 - 992.639] Leisure Time and less requirement to

[990.6 - 996.5400000000001] work and so that means that we'll

[992.639 - 998.94] probably change where we live how we eat

[996.54 - 1001.639] um access to other services like

[998.94 - 1003.6990000000001] healthcare will probably decline because

[1001.639 - 1007.519] we'll be living healthier lives I hope

[1003.699 - 1009.139] uh and so on and so forth uh one of the

[1007.519 - 1011.36] toughest nuts to crack is actually going

[1009.139 - 1013.16] to be item number eight here which is

[1011.36 - 1015.1990000000001] reshaping our identity and self-worth

[1013.16 - 1017.42] and we have actually a few slides

[1015.199 - 1019.8199999999999] dedicated to this coming right up and

[1017.42 - 1023.0] then finally number nine is regulatory

[1019.82 - 1026.6000000000001] changes that will basically have to be

[1023.0 - 1028.76] addressed as we transition from a human

[1026.6 - 1031.2199999999998] labor economy to a post-labor economy

[1028.76 - 1033.62] okay so let's unpack these

[1031.22 - 1036.919] I mentioned the ownership of production

[1033.62 - 1039.319] so this basic question is who owns the

[1036.919 - 1042.5590000000002] machines who owns the the means of

[1039.319 - 1044.72] production so if things continue the way

[1042.559 - 1046.579] that they are we run the risk of

[1044.72 - 1049.1000000000001] continued trends of capital

[1046.579 - 1050.54] concentration and or regulatory capture

[1049.1 - 1054.1399999999999] so regulatory capture is what everyone

[1050.54 - 1056.6] is afraid of with companies calling for

[1054.14 - 1059.24] regulation of AI because it's like okay

[1056.6 - 1062.299] well if only a few players are allowed

[1059.24 - 1064.76] to participate then by virtue of

[1062.299 - 1066.62] everyone else getting regulated out of

[1064.76 - 1068.539] existence only the top players are

[1066.62 - 1072.26] allowed to play that would probably be

[1068.539 - 1073.94] problematic for the rest of us now as I

[1072.26 - 1075.86] mentioned I'm not going to advocate for

[1073.94 - 1076.94] Marxism or Socialism or anything like

[1075.86 - 1078.1999999999998] that I'm not saying that we should

[1076.94 - 1080.419] collectively seize the means of

[1078.2 - 1082.28] production uh the reason being that

[1080.419 - 1084.5590000000002] market forces still work in centralized

[1082.28 - 1088.6399999999999] management uh pretty much never works at

[1084.559 - 1091.039] least not a full-scale national levels

[1088.64 - 1095.66] uh we will need more sophisticated

[1091.039 - 1097.7] models of uh ownership than exists today

[1095.66 - 1099.919] so for instance

[1097.7 - 1101.179] um you know as I mentioned uh co-ops

[1099.919 - 1103.46] Collective ownerships I've got a few

[1101.179 - 1105.679] examples in the next slide I believe but

[1103.46 - 1108.6200000000001] otherwise if corporate payrolls shrink

[1105.679 - 1110.72] and many of us lose jobs how then are we

[1108.62 - 1113.2399999999998] going to redistribute uh the the

[1110.72 - 1115.76] benefits obtained by the Technologies

[1113.24 - 1119.539] who's going to reap the rewards

[1115.76 - 1120.8799999999999] so one component of that is robust

[1119.539 - 1124.1] redistribution

[1120.88 - 1126.38] so whether or not we change ownership

[1124.1 - 1128.7199999999998] because obviously many people will still

[1126.38 - 1130.3400000000001] kind of have the idea of the value of

[1128.72 - 1132.02] private property and that sort of thing

[1130.34 - 1133.9399999999998] and certainly I think that private

[1132.02 - 1135.3799999999999] property is going to exist that being

[1133.94 - 1137.1200000000001] said not everyone is going to be a

[1135.38 - 1139.88] landowner right not everyone is going to

[1137.12 - 1142.82] own a robot Factory or or anything like

[1139.88 - 1145.7] that so we're going to need to have some

[1142.82 - 1147.74] kind of robust redistribution policy

[1145.7 - 1149.299] so that could come in the form of

[1147.74 - 1152.1200000000001] universal basic income or more

[1149.299 - 1155.24] sophisticated models and I always liken

[1152.12 - 1157.4599999999998] it to a hydrological cycle so money like

[1155.24 - 1160.82] water tends to flow towards some kind of

[1157.46 - 1163.1000000000001] accumulator now in our world those

[1160.82 - 1165.4399999999998] accumulators tend to be Federal

[1163.1 - 1168.74] governments and the capitalist class in

[1165.44 - 1171.2] form of shareholders and corporations so

[1168.74 - 1173.6] money tends to flow in those two polar

[1171.2 - 1176.539] directions and so then redistribution

[1173.6 - 1178.4599999999998] comes in the form of uh you know

[1176.539 - 1180.86] government handouts government subsidies

[1178.46 - 1182.179] that sort of thing and taxes right some

[1180.86 - 1184.34] being skimmed off the top of

[1182.179 - 1186.14] corporations in order to go to the

[1184.34 - 1189.26] government and then to be redistributed

[1186.14 - 1192.679] so the idea here is then you need a

[1189.26 - 1195.08] policy that uh basically makes it rain

[1192.679 - 1197.0590000000002] right you want it to rain a certain

[1195.08 - 1199.82] amount in every region and you want it

[1197.059 - 1201.44] to rain fairly you don't want too much

[1199.82 - 1202.76] rain because that's inflation and that's

[1201.44 - 1204.44] bad and you don't want too little rain

[1202.76 - 1207.02] because that's deflation and that's also

[1204.44 - 1209.539] bad so the idea is that these future

[1207.02 - 1212.3799999999999] redistributive policies need to

[1209.539 - 1216.44] distribute the the money like the water

[1212.38 - 1219.2] evenly fairly and uh in a controlled

[1216.44 - 1221.96] policy so this is uh not exactly your

[1219.2 - 1224.0] grandpa's trickle-down economics Theory

[1221.96 - 1225.74] uh I mentioned Collective ownership and

[1224.0 - 1227.48] there are a few examples of collective

[1225.74 - 1229.22] ownership out there now granted none of

[1227.48 - 1230.72] these are global scale but we've got a

[1229.22 - 1233.299] long time before we need to worry about

[1230.72 - 1235.76] global scale redistribution some of them

[1233.299 - 1237.02] are national scale uh which is a good

[1235.76 - 1239.6] thing but of course

[1237.02 - 1242.96] um Norway is not as big as America

[1239.6 - 1244.8799999999999] uh so there's a few examples so one is

[1242.96 - 1246.679] the Alaska Permanent Fund which is

[1244.88 - 1250.0390000000002] basically that uh pretty much every

[1246.679 - 1251.72] every Alaskan gets a annual check for

[1250.039 - 1252.74] Collective ownership of the oil reserves

[1251.72 - 1254.78] in Alaska

[1252.74 - 1256.4] the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund

[1254.78 - 1259.28] pretty much the same thing but for all

[1256.4 - 1260.66] citizens of Norway and it is a trust

[1259.28 - 1264.1399999999999] fund that is used to fund public

[1260.66 - 1266.78] services and it is funded by their oil

[1264.14 - 1268.64] reserves the mon Dragon Corporation is

[1266.78 - 1271.3999999999999] an owner-operated Corporation in Spain

[1268.64 - 1274.22] and then the Green Bay Packers are uh

[1271.4 - 1277.22] NFL team that is unique among the NFL

[1274.22 - 1278.78] that is collectively owned by 360

[1277.22 - 1281.48] 000 shareholders

[1278.78 - 1283.76] so on the topic of collective ownership

[1281.48 - 1287.179] and redistribution Sam Altman does want

[1283.76 - 1289.76] to do something uh in in line of this

[1287.179 - 1293.539] basically saying if openai owns the

[1289.76 - 1295.52] means of production AKA gbt4 5 6 and 7

[1293.539 - 1298.1589999999999] and whatever other Downstream models

[1295.52 - 1300.02] they come up with he has explicitly said

[1298.159 - 1302.48] that he wants to kind of create a trust

[1300.02 - 1304.8799999999999] fund of sorts that is then used to

[1302.48 - 1307.88] distribute that uh that surplus of

[1304.88 - 1311.0] wealth and this is part of one of his

[1307.88 - 1313.4] ideas which is World coin now what I

[1311.0 - 1315.32] will say is that I'm not sure that this

[1313.4 - 1318.679] entire project should be piloted and

[1315.32 - 1320.539] mediated by a Silicon Valley CEO Silicon

[1318.679 - 1323.7800000000002] Valley CEOs don't exactly have a good

[1320.539 - 1325.58] track record in terms of being fair and

[1323.78 - 1328.039] not allowing power to corrupt them over

[1325.58 - 1330.08] time now this is not a personal

[1328.039 - 1332.419] indictment of Sam Altman I very much

[1330.08 - 1334.6999999999998] often agree with what he says but that

[1332.419 - 1336.98] being said he is in a position of a lot

[1334.7 - 1338.6000000000001] of privilege and power and so therefore

[1336.98 - 1340.58] should be scrutinized there should we

[1338.6 - 1342.4399999999998] should should engage with a healthy

[1340.58 - 1343.6999999999998] level of skepticism and I have a feeling

[1342.44 - 1346.5800000000002] that he would invite that healthy

[1343.7 - 1348.799] skepticism as well but again I don't

[1346.58 - 1350.72] disagree with the sentiment were I in

[1348.799 - 1352.82] his place I would probably be trying to

[1350.72 - 1354.74] do the same exact thing

[1352.82 - 1357.4399999999998] um but again actions speak louder than

[1354.74 - 1359.1200000000001] words so another thing is that

[1357.44 - 1361.88] Collective ownership doesn't necessarily

[1359.12 - 1365.059] have to happen on a national scale or a

[1361.88 - 1367.1000000000001] state scale it can happen on uh local

[1365.059 - 1369.2] scales and does in the form of land

[1367.1 - 1370.8799999999999] trusts so there are plenty of examples

[1369.2 - 1372.0800000000002] of collective ownership that exists

[1370.88 - 1377.3200000000002] today

[1372.08 - 1381.1399999999999] now one thing that is uh kind of the

[1377.32 - 1383.2] primary let's say primary complaint that

[1381.14 - 1385.64] I get when I talk about redistributive

[1383.2 - 1388.1200000000001] policies such as universal basic income

[1385.64 - 1392.9] which is what about inflation

[1388.12 - 1395.7199999999998] so there is some some Merit to this idea

[1392.9 - 1398.9] so redistribution such as universal

[1395.72 - 1401.84] basic income can actually be a force for

[1398.9 - 1404.1200000000001] inflation we did see a small but not

[1401.84 - 1407.36] negligible effect from the stimulus

[1404.12 - 1408.9399999999998] checks here in America that caused some

[1407.36 - 1411.08] of the inflation now I will say that

[1408.94 - 1414.26] aggregate supply and aggregate demand

[1411.08 - 1415.76] and other supply chain issues are far

[1414.26 - 1417.919] larger effects of the current

[1415.76 - 1419.78] inflationary uh Paradigm that we're

[1417.919 - 1422.0590000000002] seeing that being said the stimulus

[1419.78 - 1425.299] checks did cause some inflation because

[1422.059 - 1427.039] they uh created higher aggregate demand

[1425.299 - 1428.539] which is basically that consumers

[1427.039 - 1431.179] overall have more money to spend

[1428.539 - 1433.52] therefore prices go up another thing

[1431.179 - 1436.88] that can drive inflation is inelastic

[1433.52 - 1440.179] supply so as Global wealth goes up due

[1436.88 - 1443.0590000000002] to AI as more productivity goes up and

[1440.179 - 1444.98] demand goes up broadly there are going

[1443.059 - 1447.44] to be goods and services and other

[1444.98 - 1449.78] supplies that do not scale

[1447.44 - 1451.8200000000002] so for instance one of the most limited

[1449.78 - 1454.6399999999999] resources on the planet is Rare Minerals

[1451.82 - 1456.26] like lithium and Cobalt no amount of AI

[1454.64 - 1458.179] is going to make there be more Ai and

[1456.26 - 1460.8799999999999] Cobalt unless of course it can dig

[1458.179 - 1463.1000000000001] deeper into the Earth's crust or go to

[1460.88 - 1465.14] saddle asteroids and mine them there

[1463.1 - 1467.4189999999999] which is entirely possible I did mention

[1465.14 - 1469.3400000000001] that in a previous video as one of the

[1467.419 - 1471.38] possible solutions to Mineral scarcity

[1469.34 - 1473.24] that being said there's only ever going

[1471.38 - 1475.46] to be so much desirable beachfront

[1473.24 - 1477.32] property in Monaco right

[1475.46 - 1479.179] um so there's there's going to be some

[1477.32 - 1481.46] kind of scarcity that we cannot overcome

[1479.179 - 1484.72] no matter how much cognitive Surplus

[1481.46 - 1487.159] that we have now all that being said

[1484.72 - 1489.2] there will be some inflationary

[1487.159 - 1492.14] pressures that we can't really get rid

[1489.2 - 1494.72] of but I think that in the long run they

[1492.14 - 1496.46] are going to be offset by and large by

[1494.72 - 1498.32] some really profound and strong

[1496.46 - 1500.48] deflationary pressures

[1498.32 - 1503.72] so for instance a deflationary pressure

[1500.48 - 1506.179] is something that lowers prices so the

[1503.72 - 1508.82] job loss that I am anticipating from AI

[1506.179 - 1511.52] is going to reduce consumer demand until

[1508.82 - 1515.72] that is somehow fixed or replaced

[1511.52 - 1517.58] because with job losses people are going

[1515.72 - 1520.52] to hoard their money A little bit more

[1517.58 - 1523.52] we saw this happen during the pandemic

[1520.52 - 1525.62] for instance where people spent a lot

[1523.52 - 1528.799] less money because it was a time of

[1525.62 - 1530.4799999999998] uncertainty if you lose your job as many

[1528.799 - 1532.76] people in some of the communities that

[1530.48 - 1534.679] I'm a part of have been laid off as part

[1532.76 - 1536.0] of the tech layoffs they don't know if

[1534.679 - 1538.24] or when they're ever going to get a job

[1536.0 - 1538.24] again

[1538.4 - 1542.779] like that's a pretty profound thing so

[1540.44 - 1544.22] job loss results in deflationary

[1542.779 - 1546.44] pressure because people are spending

[1544.22 - 1547.76] money less and driving demand down in

[1546.44 - 1548.96] fact one of the things that my wife and

[1547.76 - 1551.299] I are doing is we're going to be

[1548.96 - 1552.559] downsizing right rather than having a

[1551.299 - 1555.44] house payment we're going to move to a

[1552.559 - 1557.12] smaller house that we can fully pay off

[1555.44 - 1559.3400000000001] Market saturation is another

[1557.12 - 1560.84] deflationary pressure so for instance I

[1559.34 - 1563.1789999999999] did mention earlier that some goods and

[1560.84 - 1566.1789999999999] services will continue to go down in

[1563.179 - 1568.76] price one personal example that I have

[1566.179 - 1571.279] is that the first time I had my novel

[1568.76 - 1573.26] professionally edited I spent Seventeen

[1571.279 - 1575.36] hundred dollars to have a world-class

[1573.26 - 1576.62] professional editor take a look at my

[1575.36 - 1580.2199999999998] novel

[1576.62 - 1582.9799999999998] after I got that feedback uh from her I

[1580.22 - 1585.8600000000001] then not long after that I got access to

[1582.98 - 1588.14] gpt4 which has a much larger context

[1585.86 - 1590.84] window and I was able to uh pretty much

[1588.14 - 1594.14] get developmental feedback or um or line

[1590.84 - 1599.8999999999999] editing feedback on the entire thing for

[1594.14 - 1603.919] less than 17 twice so that is a 100x

[1599.9 - 1605.96] drop in price and it's really difficult

[1603.919 - 1608.419] for people to wrap their heads around

[1605.96 - 1610.82] the possibility that many goods and

[1608.419 - 1613.7] services are going to be a thousand X

[1610.82 - 1616.9399999999998] cheaper or 10 000 X cheaper in the

[1613.7 - 1620.9] coming years so this downward pressure

[1616.94 - 1622.4] due to the the abundance of AI is going

[1620.9 - 1624.6200000000001] to be something that is kind of like a

[1622.4 - 1627.02] default raise for everyone if it works

[1624.62 - 1629.1789999999999] out that way so in the case of medicine

[1627.02 - 1632.559] or the total cost of Health Care in

[1629.179 - 1634.94] America is 4.3 trillion dollars per year

[1632.559 - 1638.1789999999999] imagine if

[1634.94 - 1640.159] within a few years AI is able to reduce

[1638.179 - 1642.5590000000002] the total cost of Health Care in America

[1640.159 - 1644.48] by a factor of a hundred

[1642.559 - 1646.58] I know that this sounds completely

[1644.48 - 1647.779] ludicrous and it probably will take a

[1646.58 - 1649.3999999999999] little bit longer than a few years

[1647.779 - 1652.82] because the medical establishment is

[1649.4 - 1655.76] very slow very onerous and does not is

[1652.82 - 1658.58] very resistant to change but imagine if

[1655.76 - 1660.44] your health care costs whatever they

[1658.58 - 1661.76] were last year if you spend you know a

[1660.44 - 1663.3200000000002] few hundred dollars on a couple

[1661.76 - 1665.24] medications and one trip to the doctor

[1663.32 - 1666.799] or if you have chronic conditions that

[1665.24 - 1668.659] require a lot of medications and a lot

[1666.799 - 1670.8799999999999] of tests and you spend you know five

[1668.659 - 1673.0390000000002] thousand dollars imagine if you only had

[1670.88 - 1675.6200000000001] to spend fifty dollars last year instead

[1673.039 - 1678.799] of five thousand and that's not with uh

[1675.62 - 1680.4189999999999] with you know socialist policies or

[1678.799 - 1681.9189999999999] um or single-payer systems where the

[1680.419 - 1683.48] government foots the bill I'm talking

[1681.919 - 1686.779] about the actual cost of Health Care

[1683.48 - 1689.419] could collapse that much in the long run

[1686.779 - 1691.1] due to Ai and so that is a tremendous

[1689.419 - 1693.38] deflationary pressure so basically

[1691.1 - 1696.3799999999999] deflation means that your dollar goes

[1693.38 - 1699.2600000000002] much farther another thing to consider

[1696.38 - 1701.779] is that in many cases there are elastic

[1699.26 - 1703.299] supplies so imagine the knock-on effects

[1701.779 - 1707.0] of AI

[1703.299 - 1709.4] enhancing everything from Supply chains

[1707.0 - 1711.679] at every level reducing the need for

[1709.4 - 1713.179] middlemen reducing the need for humans

[1711.679 - 1715.039] and human labor which is really

[1713.179 - 1717.38] expensive so all the goods and services

[1715.039 - 1720.3799999999999] that you get even if an AI is not

[1717.38 - 1722.659] directly used in creating that final

[1720.38 - 1724.6000000000001] good or service it's still going to help

[1722.659 - 1728.5390000000002] the entire process

[1724.6 - 1730.1589999999999] which means that the entire economy is

[1728.539 - 1733.279] going to be a lot more elastic which

[1730.159 - 1736.279] will also drive down prices

[1733.279 - 1738.32] now we get to the hardest part of all of

[1736.279 - 1740.96] this the rest I think is going to happen

[1738.32 - 1743.48] no matter what we do right there is just

[1740.96 - 1745.58] so much economic incentive to drive down

[1743.48 - 1747.919] prices because that's what capitalism

[1745.58 - 1749.6589999999999] does right it seeks efficiency when it's

[1747.919 - 1751.8200000000002] working well it doesn't always work well

[1749.659 - 1754.7] so I'll throw I'll throw that caveat out

[1751.82 - 1757.1] now that being said the inevitable

[1754.7 - 1759.2] conclusion of all this seems to be that

[1757.1 - 1762.6789999999999] we are going to arrive at a situation

[1759.2 - 1764.659] where most of us are going to be looking

[1762.679 - 1767.0590000000002] in the rear view mirror and say bye job

[1764.659 - 1769.46] right like our conventional jobs are

[1767.059 - 1771.1399999999999] going to go the way of the dinosaurs and

[1769.46 - 1772.7] so one of the most common sentiments

[1771.14 - 1776.1200000000001] that I get and it's always worded

[1772.7 - 1777.8600000000001] slightly different but the their

[1776.12 - 1779.2399999999998] permutations of this thing which is I

[1777.86 - 1780.4399999999998] would rather die than live on government

[1779.24 - 1783.679] handouts

[1780.44 - 1785.179] this happens more often than not there

[1783.679 - 1787.64] are numerous reasons for this feeling

[1785.179 - 1790.7] and it is important to consider because

[1787.64 - 1794.0] what else is the point of being alive

[1790.7 - 1797.799] excuse me so there are cultural reasons

[1794.0 - 1801.08] ethical reasons religion spirituality

[1797.799 - 1802.7] and even familial history identity

[1801.08 - 1805.039] gender Norms

[1802.7 - 1809.539] um all kinds of stuff will push people

[1805.039 - 1812.799] to identify with their job or to really

[1809.539 - 1815.08] value their self-sufficiency right

[1812.799 - 1818.36] self-sufficiency rugged individualism

[1815.08 - 1819.98] self-reliance that sort of thing these

[1818.36 - 1821.4799999999998] beliefs come from numerous places

[1819.98 - 1823.82] whether it's you know the culture

[1821.48 - 1825.44] particularly here in America in many

[1823.82 - 1827.6589999999999] families like you're not considered a

[1825.44 - 1830.179] real man unless you're a provider right

[1827.659 - 1832.3400000000001] for particularly for men you might

[1830.179 - 1834.46] expect yourself and be expected to be

[1832.34 - 1837.5] the primary Breadwinner

[1834.46 - 1839.779] careers also do a lot for our sense of

[1837.5 - 1842.0] purpose our sense of excellence and

[1839.779 - 1843.559] confidence a career is a good source of

[1842.0 - 1844.76] challenge it's a good way to feel good

[1843.559 - 1845.72] about yourself like you've done

[1844.76 - 1848.899] something

[1845.72 - 1851.48] and then for even people that are not

[1848.899 - 1853.1] men Independence is often predicated on

[1851.48 - 1855.679] the ability to make ends meet and so

[1853.1 - 1858.32] what I mean by this is that if you need

[1855.679 - 1860.24] to get away from your family or a toxic

[1858.32 - 1861.6789999999999] friend group or whatever if you need to

[1860.24 - 1864.2] stay out of prison because you need to

[1861.679 - 1866.419] stay away you know from the street you

[1864.2 - 1867.799] might need that good job and so if you

[1866.419 - 1870.7990000000002] don't have that good job you might be

[1867.799 - 1872.899] forced to back into a bad situation so

[1870.799 - 1875.6] there's a lot of reasons that people are

[1872.899 - 1878.7199999999998] afraid of not having their job

[1875.6 - 1880.2199999999998] so what I've been able to identify is

[1878.72 - 1881.72] that after talking with some of these

[1880.22 - 1885.32] people and and thinking through it is

[1881.72 - 1887.48] there's two primary threads here one is

[1885.32 - 1888.9189999999999] what if I can't take care of myself and

[1887.48 - 1890.96] the people that I care about that's

[1888.919 - 1895.1000000000001] really the core fear at least one of

[1890.96 - 1897.44] them another one is another core fear is

[1895.1 - 1900.26] what if my sense of agency and autonomy

[1897.44 - 1902.24] is taken from me what if I am just

[1900.26 - 1904.7] subservient to the whims of the

[1902.24 - 1908.48] government right

[1904.7 - 1911.539] so one of the potential solutions to

[1908.48 - 1914.0] this is a concept from ancient Greece

[1911.539 - 1915.3799999999999] called erete which is Excellence or the

[1914.0 - 1918.02] pursuit of Excellence

[1915.38 - 1920.3600000000001] so in this case

[1918.02 - 1923.12] the ability to feel competent about

[1920.36 - 1927.1999999999998] something in order to feel a sense of

[1923.12 - 1930.9799999999998] Mastery and challenge this is a um

[1927.2 - 1933.799] this is a a social phenomenon

[1930.98 - 1937.159] um that was based on social reward and

[1933.799 - 1939.559] social incentive even if there was no

[1937.159 - 1943.22] Financial reward so what I mean by this

[1939.559 - 1945.9189999999999] is that uh particularly in uh the elite

[1943.22 - 1948.559] classes like aristocracy and capitalist

[1945.919 - 1950.24] class and owner class the the individual

[1948.559 - 1952.039] behaviors the individual sense of

[1950.24 - 1954.32] competence and achievement didn't

[1952.039 - 1955.94] necessarily come from a career it came

[1954.32 - 1957.559] from other achievements whether they

[1955.94 - 1960.559] were academic achievements participating

[1957.559 - 1962.539] in public life having a good family so

[1960.559 - 1964.399] on and so forth or even independent

[1962.539 - 1966.14] competitions right playing Polo and

[1964.399 - 1968.36] Yacht racing and all the other stuff

[1966.14 - 1970.22] that rich people do for fun and for

[1968.36 - 1971.299] challenge you know they do martial arts

[1970.22 - 1972.919] they

[1971.299 - 1975.26] um they go on adventures and so on and

[1972.919 - 1978.38] so forth the acquisition of status

[1975.26 - 1980.48] symbols is part of that sense of

[1978.38 - 1984.3200000000002] Excellence but there are plenty of other

[1980.48 - 1986.419] ways to achieve excellence so uh other

[1984.32 - 1988.34] aspects of pursuing the pursuit of

[1986.419 - 1991.3400000000001] Excellence include that Mastery that

[1988.34 - 1995.0] social recognition right in many cases

[1991.34 - 1996.74] it's a matter of achieving that um that

[1995.0 - 1998.72] status in the eyes of the people that

[1996.74 - 2001.0] you care about for instance going back

[1998.72 - 2003.58] to that idea of being a breadwinner that

[2001.0 - 2005.919] head of household recognition the

[2003.58 - 2007.72] recognition that you are a good man who

[2005.919 - 2009.22] takes care of his family or that you're

[2007.72 - 2010.8990000000001] a good mother who takes care of his

[2009.22 - 2015.46] family or you know whatever it happens

[2010.899 - 2018.34] to be there are other ways to Signal

[2015.46 - 2019.8990000000001] tribal belonging for instance think

[2018.34 - 2022.1789999999999] about all the guys that go to you know

[2019.899 - 2023.7399999999998] watch the game together at the bar that

[2022.179 - 2026.2] is something that gives them a sense of

[2023.74 - 2029.14] belonging and even a sense of Excellence

[2026.2 - 2031.299] if your team wins you feel uh like you

[2029.14 - 2033.94] have benefited from that confidence

[2031.299 - 2036.039] and all of this is possible without a

[2033.94 - 2037.8990000000001] conventional career now that being said

[2036.039 - 2039.82] I will say that it does take time to

[2037.899 - 2041.9189999999999] adapt I know this personally because I

[2039.82 - 2043.6589999999999] left my conventional career just earlier

[2041.919 - 2046.24] this year and I kind of floundered

[2043.659 - 2048.28] around for a while it was weird right

[2046.24 - 2050.56] and I still struggled with finding okay

[2048.28 - 2052.659] how is it that I can feel productive how

[2050.56 - 2054.82] is it that I can feel meaningful and

[2052.659 - 2056.679] valuable and so those metrics change

[2054.82 - 2059.159] right now it's a matter of how many

[2056.679 - 2061.3] views my videos get now it's a matter of

[2059.159 - 2062.859] what we talk about when I go to the

[2061.3 - 2064.54] meetups that I host and that sort of

[2062.859 - 2066.159] thing

[2064.54 - 2068.32] um now that being said I will say that

[2066.159 - 2070.839] without a conventional career

[2068.32 - 2074.32] uh finding something to be proud of

[2070.839 - 2077.2599999999998] Mastery challenged all of that uh still

[2074.32 - 2080.679] exists and it's still a need too

[2077.26 - 2082.4190000000003] one example is I picked up a Guitar so

[2080.679 - 2083.56] when I had my camera moved you probably

[2082.419 - 2085.1189999999997] saw that I had a guitar in the

[2083.56 - 2086.44] background that is a very fancy nice

[2085.119 - 2087.76] guitar that I have not yet learned to

[2086.44 - 2089.8] use that A friend gave to me many years

[2087.76 - 2092.5600000000004] ago I got a very simple guitar that has

[2089.8 - 2095.619] only three strings to start learning on

[2092.56 - 2097.54] um but my point is is that you know one

[2095.619 - 2100.06] of my dreams for myself is that I will

[2097.54 - 2101.56] one day learn how to play guitar and I

[2100.06 - 2103.66] can sit around the campfire and play

[2101.56 - 2104.98] guitar and sing with my friends and that

[2103.66 - 2106.66] is going to be something that I can

[2104.98 - 2108.46] derive a sense of Excellence or a sense

[2106.66 - 2109.8999999999996] of Mastery from might never get there

[2108.46 - 2114.579] because I am

[2109.9 - 2118.06] both tone deaf and I have awful timing

[2114.579 - 2120.099] so you know uh anyways I wanted to close

[2118.06 - 2121.7799999999997] this with physical fitness is one of the

[2120.099 - 2124.54] most familiar models that people have

[2121.78 - 2126.7000000000003] with a pursuing Excellence we all know a

[2124.54 - 2129.4] bunch of Jim Bros and Gym Rats who

[2126.7 - 2132.0989999999997] really Bank a lot of their pride and

[2129.4 - 2134.38] their ego on looking good and feeling

[2132.099 - 2136.54] good and being fit and looking sexy

[2134.38 - 2138.579] right that is a model that everyone has

[2136.54 - 2140.68] a lot of people do this and it's not for

[2138.579 - 2142.8390000000004] financial gain it is purely for the

[2140.68 - 2144.8799999999997] pursuit of excellence and so you take

[2142.839 - 2146.74] that gym model and there's all kinds of

[2144.88 - 2148.2400000000002] other stuff you can do with that a lot

[2146.74 - 2149.859] of my friends are Gamers and they and

[2148.24 - 2152.74] some of them even game competitively

[2149.859 - 2154.5989999999997] same exact need being met is you get

[2152.74 - 2155.68] that challenge you get the reward of

[2154.599 - 2157.54] winning

[2155.68 - 2159.04] or otherwise getting recognition for

[2157.54 - 2161.2] Your Excellence

[2159.04 - 2163.3] now the other part and this is actually

[2161.2 - 2166.06] a little bit harder to address is

[2163.3 - 2170.619] autonomy self-determination

[2166.06 - 2173.619] losing your autonomy is a major cause of

[2170.619 - 2176.099] burnout which is true for me you can

[2173.619 - 2178.5] check out a video on my other channel

[2176.099 - 2181.1800000000003] talking about burnout

[2178.5 - 2183.04] it's also a cause of rebellion and

[2181.18 - 2185.3799999999997] despair so in many cases around the

[2183.04 - 2187.96] world win Rebellion has happened it is

[2185.38 - 2191.2000000000003] because the citizenry lost their sense

[2187.96 - 2192.82] of autonomy either due to oppression or

[2191.2 - 2194.3199999999997] just economic collapse and they said

[2192.82 - 2196.78] okay we're not really happy with this

[2194.32 - 2199.06] we're going to take the power back

[2196.78 - 2200.98] so this is a legitimate fear and let me

[2199.06 - 2203.56] underscore why

[2200.98 - 2206.38] if the jobs go away which I predict they

[2203.56 - 2208.54] will then your money goes away and

[2206.38 - 2211.54] particularly in America your personal

[2208.54 - 2214.96] autonomy is directly tied to your wallet

[2211.54 - 2216.46] your financial power is this is and this

[2214.96 - 2219.28] is actually an explicit policy of

[2216.46 - 2221.2] neoliberal societies is it is it the

[2219.28 - 2223.119] freedom in the neoliberal society is

[2221.2 - 2227.0789999999997] freedom to spend money however you

[2223.119 - 2228.7000000000003] choose but this has the the uh the dark

[2227.079 - 2230.38] side of that is that if you don't have

[2228.7 - 2232.5989999999997] money you're not free which everyone

[2230.38 - 2234.76] knows that in America right this is

[2232.599 - 2236.8590000000004] something that uh people have said like

[2234.76 - 2239.079] oh you know you're only as free as your

[2236.859 - 2241.06] dollar right so this is not a new

[2239.079 - 2244.119] phenomenon and this is why people are

[2241.06 - 2247.2999999999997] afraid of AI ultimately taking their

[2244.119 - 2248.52] jobs at least one of the reasons

[2247.3 - 2252.82] um

[2248.52 - 2254.5] this is a very powerful incentive and

[2252.82 - 2256.78] I've actually had conversations over

[2254.5 - 2258.46] many many years particularly with

[2256.78 - 2260.8590000000004] conservatives that they say that this is

[2258.46 - 2263.02] actually a very deliberate policy in

[2260.859 - 2265.42] order to motivate people to work harder

[2263.02 - 2267.16] and the idea is that the fear of not

[2265.42 - 2269.56] having money and the fear of losing your

[2267.16 - 2271.48] freedom is a powerful motivating factor

[2269.56 - 2275.38] and of course this is the de facto

[2271.48 - 2277.72] policy of America for several decades

[2275.38 - 2280.2400000000002] um and it's taken even further because

[2277.72 - 2282.8799999999997] part of that fear part of the part of

[2280.24 - 2285.5789999999997] the motivating people away from poverty

[2282.88 - 2287.4] is that poverty is something to be

[2285.579 - 2290.26] ashamed of particularly in America

[2287.4 - 2292.48] poverty or being poor is seen as a moral

[2290.26 - 2294.579] failing or even a sin that if you're

[2292.48 - 2296.94] poor not only do you deserve it but it's

[2294.579 - 2300.1600000000003] your fault because you're a bad person

[2296.94 - 2301.9] and in this case the the more money you

[2300.16 - 2303.7] have the more free you are but also the

[2301.9 - 2306.099] more virtuous or righteous you are and

[2303.7 - 2309.5789999999997] this goes back to our Protestant and

[2306.099 - 2311.32] Puritan Roots so personal agency or

[2309.579 - 2313.7200000000003] self-determination or autonomy is

[2311.32 - 2316.2000000000003] inextricably tied to your financial

[2313.72 - 2318.5789999999997] power this is a very problematic

[2316.2 - 2321.04] mentality and I'm not saying that like

[2318.579 - 2323.6800000000003] if you feel this way it's it's not your

[2321.04 - 2326.2599999999998] fault I'm saying that like the fact that

[2323.68 - 2328.66] this exists in our Zeitgeist is that's

[2326.26 - 2330.94] that's the problem now

[2328.66 - 2333.46] with post-labor economics this is my

[2330.94 - 2335.56] hope and dream is that with post-labor

[2333.46 - 2337.7200000000003] economics if optimal redistributions

[2335.56 - 2340.359] remember the idea of the rain clouds

[2337.72 - 2342.7599999999998] dropping rain everywhere if optimal

[2340.359 - 2346.48] redistribution is achieved then our

[2342.76 - 2348.5200000000004] individual autonomy should increase so

[2346.48 - 2351.22] what I mean by this is that first

[2348.52 - 2353.2599999999998] abundance of free time imagine that your

[2351.22 - 2356.68] need for for working a day job goes away

[2353.26 - 2359.92] so suddenly you have 40 hours of per

[2356.68 - 2363.52] week back that's all yours so free time

[2359.92 - 2365.26] is one component of autonomy the other

[2363.52 - 2368.02] thing is the decrease in cost that we

[2365.26 - 2371.26] talk about so if a lot of goods and

[2368.02 - 2374.38] services go down in price then whatever

[2371.26 - 2375.94] money you do have is actually going to

[2374.38 - 2378.2200000000003] take you further so basically your

[2375.94 - 2381.88] financial power is effectively increased

[2378.22 - 2384.7] even if you don't make as much money now

[2381.88 - 2386.32] that being said the biggest problem the

[2384.7 - 2388.72] elephant in the room for all this is

[2386.32 - 2390.6400000000003] that trust in the American system is low

[2388.72 - 2393.04] the government has a poor track record

[2390.64 - 2394.7799999999997] of sticking the landing on these kinds

[2393.04 - 2396.52] of things and this is not something that

[2394.78 - 2399.96] you and I can fix this is something that

[2396.52 - 2399.96] the government has to decide to fix

[2400.359 - 2404.74] now as we wind down we're getting closer

[2402.46 - 2408.04] to the end of the video so

[2404.74 - 2410.2599999999998] this is kind of for for us nerds uh the

[2408.04 - 2411.7] metrologists the matricians who really

[2410.26 - 2413.0200000000004] want to say okay well how do we measure

[2411.7 - 2415.839] this stuff and this is just kind of like

[2413.02 - 2418.9] me throwing wet spaghetti at the wall

[2415.839 - 2421.06] as I mentioned earlier existing key

[2418.9 - 2423.04] performance indicators kpi like labor

[2421.06 - 2425.32] force participation rate probably won't

[2423.04 - 2428.099] matter as much in the future we're going

[2425.32 - 2430.599] to need to measure economic productivity

[2428.099 - 2432.94] uh and individual well-being through

[2430.599 - 2435.2200000000003] entirely different means but this

[2432.94 - 2437.28] underscores the the key question which

[2435.22 - 2440.2] is what are we trying to optimize for

[2437.28 - 2442.42] GDP is a proxy for a lot of other things

[2440.2 - 2444.46] but it's also an aggregate number that

[2442.42 - 2447.04] is on its own relatively useless just

[2444.46 - 2449.32] kind of like how the stock market is an

[2447.04 - 2451.96] aggregate number that for you and me on

[2449.32 - 2455.079] a day-to-day basis pretty useless

[2451.96 - 2456.9] so one idea that I had was a well-being

[2455.079 - 2459.3390000000004] index which would be based on

[2456.9 - 2462.1600000000003] self-determination Theory

[2459.339 - 2463.66] um and so it would measure a

[2462.16 - 2466.2999999999997] population's well-being based on

[2463.66 - 2469.06] autonomy Mastery or competence and

[2466.3 - 2470.619] connection so that would be like how

[2469.06 - 2474.4] much free time does everyone have in the

[2470.619 - 2476.619] in in your um in your uh Nation how much

[2474.4 - 2478.839] Social Mobility do they have in terms of

[2476.619 - 2480.4] the ability to live where they want and

[2478.839 - 2482.619] go on the vacations that they want to

[2480.4 - 2484.7200000000003] and take on the leader activities that

[2482.619 - 2485.859] they want to so autonomy would be a

[2484.72 - 2487.8999999999996] really important thing to measure and

[2485.859 - 2489.64] try and optimize for Mastery or

[2487.9 - 2491.26] competence would be another thing and

[2489.64 - 2493.48] that's a much that's a lot harder to

[2491.26 - 2495.1600000000003] measure in aggregate because for some it

[2493.48 - 2496.96] looks different for everyone for some

[2495.16 - 2499.72] people Mastery might be getting a third

[2496.96 - 2501.4] PhD for other people it might be joining

[2499.72 - 2503.68] you know a football league or something

[2501.4 - 2506.44] it again it's really difficult to

[2503.68 - 2507.3999999999996] measure and then finally connection is

[2506.44 - 2510.099] the third component of

[2507.4 - 2512.32] self-determination Theory or sdt and

[2510.099 - 2514.1800000000003] connection it can easily be measured by

[2512.32 - 2515.32] number of friends that you have amount

[2514.18 - 2517.48] of time you spend with friends and

[2515.32 - 2521.619] family and that sort of thing

[2517.48 - 2523.2400000000002] um so uh another uh existing index is

[2521.619 - 2524.56] the Ginny coefficient which measures

[2523.24 - 2526.54] wealth distribution and wealth

[2524.56 - 2528.4] inequality but again that is just a

[2526.54 - 2530.32] proxy for other things and that presumes

[2528.4 - 2532.78] that wealth solves all other problems

[2530.32 - 2534.28] which it certainly helps it solves a lot

[2532.78 - 2537.6400000000003] of problems but it doesn't solve all

[2534.28 - 2539.7400000000002] problems another uh potentially valuable

[2537.64 - 2541.96] framework in order to create these new

[2539.74 - 2544.24] kpi that we might need to optimize for

[2541.96 - 2546.76] in post labor economics would be

[2544.24 - 2548.2599999999998] Maslow's hierarchy of needs is everyone

[2546.76 - 2550.7200000000003] getting their basic needs met is

[2548.26 - 2552.82] everyone getting uh and there's a lot of

[2550.72 - 2555.04] overlap between Maslow and sdt so I

[2552.82 - 2557.56] don't need to rehash all that

[2555.04 - 2559.48] so anyways this was a really powerful

[2557.56 - 2562.74] deep dive I hope you got a lot out of it

[2559.48 - 2562.7400000000002] and thanks for watching
