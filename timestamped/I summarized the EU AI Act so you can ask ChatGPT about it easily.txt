[0.079 - 5.04] I think we're ready to begin

[3.419 - 6.24] um he saw me look at the camera used to

[5.04 - 11.04] be over there now you're over here okay

[6.24 - 13.559000000000001] so I ran a poll uh 17 hours ago I asked

[11.04 - 17.34] if you all wanted me to do a video on

[13.559 - 19.02] the euai ACT man got names gotta get

[17.34 - 20.939] better with names I'm good with acronyms

[19.02 - 24.9] come to me for acronyms

[20.939 - 26.82] gato Gaia Aegis okay anyways so y'all

[24.9 - 28.08] were confused about what I meant by Haas

[26.82 - 29.699] which is something from here in the

[28.08 - 33.18] South basically Haas means just

[29.699 - 36.120000000000005] something big right it's short it's a

[33.18 - 38.34] southern dialect for a horse or in

[36.12 - 41.339999999999996] particular a big horse

[38.34 - 43.800000000000004] um so this document is a Haas because

[41.34 - 46.14] look how freaking long it is

[43.8 - 48.538999999999994] it just keeps going

[46.14 - 52.559] so I plugged it in over here

[48.539 - 56.399] and it is uh 70 000 tokens long so even

[52.559 - 58.44] if I had access to uh GPT 432k which I

[56.399 - 60.42] did briefly and then they revoked it I

[58.44 - 63.959999999999994] think they got overwhelmed uh because I

[60.42 - 65.58] used it I tried to use uh GPT uh 432k on

[63.96 - 67.92] a couple things and it was just like

[65.58 - 70.25999999999999] server is overloaded servers are anyways

[67.92 - 72.42] so hopefully I get that back but the

[70.26 - 73.92] idea was there would be I could read it

[72.42 - 76.38] and you know chop it up into maybe four

[73.92 - 78.0] sections uh three or four sections and

[76.38 - 81.86] read the whole thing but we don't have

[78.0 - 85.02] that and I do have uh GPT 3.5 turbo

[81.86 - 88.32] 16k0613 so this model is actually super

[85.02 - 93.06] super steerable it is actually better

[88.32 - 94.67999999999999] than original gpt4 at a lot of things

[93.06 - 96.78] um it's still kind of dumb especially if

[94.68 - 100.4] the instructions are too complex but as

[96.78 - 105.659] long as you give it just one task uh GPT

[100.4 - 107.64] 3.3.5 turbo 0613 the June 13th model

[105.659 - 109.97900000000001] um is more than adequate for most things

[107.64 - 112.07900000000001] now that being said because I'm

[109.979 - 115.88] interpreting legalese and I'm doing

[112.079 - 118.619] summarization I'm going to use 04

[115.88 - 120.83999999999999] 613. So the instructions that I gave it

[118.619 - 123.18] just now and I know that I'm ready to

[120.84 - 125.84] start the video primary purpose

[123.18 - 127.97900000000001] zoom in a little bit the primary purpose

[125.84 - 129.72] or the following is a chunk of

[127.979 - 132.48] legislation your job is to summarize

[129.72 - 135.18] this legislative legislation with two

[132.48 - 137.28] primary goals one drastically reduce the

[135.18 - 139.08] word count and two retain enough context

[137.28 - 140.76] that it will still make sense the reason

[139.08 - 142.14000000000001] for this is the current AI technology

[140.76 - 144.12] can only read chunks that are so big

[142.14 - 146.33999999999997] method the user will give you a chunk of

[144.12 - 148.02] legislation via chat your response must

[146.34 - 149.58] only be the summarized version do not

[148.02 - 151.31900000000002] chat with the user engage with them or

[149.58 - 154.459] offer any other commentary summarize

[151.319 - 158.35999999999999] only so I copied the first hundred lines

[154.459 - 161.76] of the legislation into here

[158.36 - 163.62] and this is what it spit out so it took

[161.76 - 166.14] all that and just said okay this is what

[163.62 - 168.72] it means so the first hundred lines

[166.14 - 173.05999999999997] which you can see here

[168.72 - 176.22] so we've got 344 000 characters

[173.06 - 177.66] 3665 lines of stuff to go through I'm

[176.22 - 181.56] not going to read the whole thing I'm

[177.66 - 183.48] not AI explained uh that dude just like

[181.56 - 184.8] y'all are impressed with how much work I

[183.48 - 187.5] can do I'm impressed with how much that

[184.8 - 191.42000000000002] dude can read just honestly I'm maybe he

[187.5 - 194.64] uses chat GPT I don't know anyways

[191.42 - 197.78] if you're watching it's just a joke

[194.64 - 201.5] um okay so anyways uh so ultimately

[197.78 - 204.599] basically that that first hundred lines

[201.5 - 206.64] uh was summarized and condensed down to

[204.599 - 208.85999999999999] the European commission proposes a

[206.64 - 210.35999999999999] regulation for harmonized rules on

[208.86 - 213.12] artificial intelligence aiming to

[210.36 - 215.64000000000001] balance the socioeconomic benefits of AI

[213.12 - 217.92000000000002] with potential risks The Proposal seeks

[215.64 - 219.72] to ensure AI systems are safe respect

[217.92 - 221.28] fundamental rights provide legal

[219.72 - 223.68] certainty for investment in Innovation

[221.28 - 226.019] enhance governance and prevent Market

[223.68 - 228.78] fragmentation so it has says nothing

[226.019 - 230.459] about existential risks or prevent AI

[228.78 - 232.56] from killing everyone it's sort of

[230.459 - 233.94] implicit because like if AI kills

[232.56 - 235.98] everyone you can't have investment in

[233.94 - 239.22] Innovation but I would rather see

[235.98 - 240.72] legislation that is explicit it proposes

[239.22 - 242.819] a risk-based approach prohibiting

[240.72 - 245.04] certain harmful AI practices and setting

[242.819 - 246.95899999999997] requirements for high-risk AI systems

[245.04 - 248.22] okay cool we'll see how they Define that

[246.959 - 250.26] later

[248.22 - 251.939] The Proposal also establishes a

[250.26 - 253.62] governance system at member state level

[251.939 - 255.959] and a European artificial intelligence

[253.62 - 257.16] board at Union level Okay cool so this

[255.959 - 260.4] is this is going to be an international

[257.16 - 262.5] regulator great it is consistent with

[260.4 - 264.35999999999996] existing Union legislation and policies

[262.5 - 265.86] including data protection consumer

[264.36 - 268.199] protection non-discrimination and gender

[265.86 - 270.41900000000004] equality so these are all very low level

[268.199 - 272.759] risks none of this is actually talking

[270.419 - 274.25899999999996] like when they say high risk they're

[272.759 - 277.62] probably meaning like the social credit

[274.259 - 279.47900000000004] system uh that is used in China which

[277.62 - 282.12] that is a high risk but it is not the

[279.479 - 283.74] highest risk The Proposal is based on

[282.12 - 285.3] article 114 of the Treaty of the

[283.74 - 289.259] functioning of the European Union Union

[285.3 - 290.759] the tfeu which ensures The Establishment

[289.259 - 293.639] and functioning of the internal Market

[290.759 - 295.8] okay so this is mostly a market-oriented

[293.639 - 297.78000000000003] piece of legislation great so we know

[295.8 - 299.16] that this works so let's go ahead and

[297.78 - 301.19899999999996] save this out I'm going to walk you

[299.16 - 303.78000000000003] through the whole process

[301.199 - 305.34000000000003] um and then I'll yeah so this is this is

[303.78 - 307.02] how this is how we're going to proceed

[305.34 - 308.58] for those of you that are newer to my

[307.02 - 310.74] channel this is actually the original

[308.58 - 311.88] format that I used where I would where I

[310.74 - 314.639] would walk you through the entire

[311.88 - 317.34] process so just watched it on 2X and

[314.639 - 319.32] you'll see the whole process of how I

[317.34 - 324.11999999999995] approach these things so we'll call this

[319.32 - 326.58] system summarize yes dot text

[324.12 - 328.5] and so basically I give it a system a

[326.58 - 331.02] system message with very very clear

[328.5 - 333.18] instructions uh and and what I expect

[331.02 - 334.68] and and what it should expect and then

[333.18 - 338.94] it gives you very clear consistent

[334.68 - 340.16] results so then we come over to

[338.94 - 343.199] um

[340.16 - 347.03900000000004] Step One simplify so this is I'm just re

[343.199 - 348.96000000000004] I'm borrowing code uh which I always do

[347.039 - 350.94] um

[348.96 - 353.34] so we've got this so this is what we're

[350.94 - 355.62] going to use to do that

[353.34 - 357.0] um this is this is this is a KB service

[355.62 - 359.88] that I'm working on so I'll show you

[357.0 - 363.68] that in an upcoming video

[359.88 - 363.68] um but you don't get to see that yet

[364.139 - 367.68] we don't need KB functions so delete

[366.539 - 369.78] that

[367.68 - 371.759] flask routes we're not going to do a

[369.78 - 374.58] flask app so that's also fine actually I

[371.759 - 376.259] guess I just delete most of it okay cool

[374.58 - 377.34] so we get rid of flask because we're not

[376.259 - 379.38] going to do that we're not going to do

[377.34 - 385.28] threading We're Not Gonna we don't need

[379.38 - 385.28] flask or logging or Json or yaml okay

[386.22 - 389.759] clean it up I probably should have done

[388.199 - 392.16] that before I started the video but it's

[389.759 - 393.96000000000004] good to it's good for you to see how

[392.16 - 395.46000000000004] messy my process is

[393.96 - 396.96] um I am the first person to tell you I

[395.46 - 399.539] am not a professional developer I never

[396.96 - 401.69899999999996] was my uh professional background was I

[399.539 - 403.919] was uh in virtualization and automation

[401.699 - 405.36] so I'm an automation engineer which is

[403.919 - 408.479] why I approach things the way that I do

[405.36 - 410.039] which is creating discrete steps

[408.479 - 412.62] um so you notice the FI the title of

[410.039 - 414.59999999999997] this is uh step one simplify

[412.62 - 418.74] um Okay cool so basically what we're

[414.6 - 421.97900000000004] going to do is we're going to ask this

[418.74 - 425.28000000000003] handy dandy uh coding chat bot that I

[421.979 - 428.4] built which you can use this it is

[425.28 - 430.79999999999995] available over

[428.4 - 433.02] here

[430.8 - 437.039] um I had a bunch of people submitting

[433.02 - 439.08] um uh uh pull requests and they kept

[437.039 - 440.34] trying to like change the way that this

[439.08 - 443.639] thing works so I just set it to public

[440.34 - 446.69899999999996] archive so here's the thing is I welcome

[443.639 - 449.40000000000003] pull requests that are like

[446.699 - 451.44] simple fixes or small improvements don't

[449.4 - 453.65999999999997] refactor my code just Fork it right like

[451.44 - 455.28] there's 19 Forks if you want to if you

[453.66 - 456.72] want to fundamentally change how it

[455.28 - 458.46] works fine

[456.72 - 460.08000000000004] um but I got tired of people messing up

[458.46 - 462.0] my code so I just set it to public

[460.08 - 463.139] archive and guess what like people you

[462.0 - 466.46] can still do whatever you want with it

[463.139 - 468.78000000000003] anyways so we're going to use this as a

[466.46 - 472.02] co-pilot tool because I got frustrated

[468.78 - 474.35999999999996] with GitHub because they're co-pilot uh

[472.02 - 476.639] customer service whatever documentation

[474.36 - 479.699] is garbage okay

[476.639 - 483.12] uh let's see I have um here let's just

[479.699 - 483.72] write a function that accepts

[483.12 - 487.8] um

[483.72 - 488.72] a gigantic string and returns

[487.8 - 492.12] um

[488.72 - 493.44000000000005] let's see and let's see splits it by

[492.12 - 495.66] lines

[493.44 - 501.12] and then chunks

[495.66 - 502.97900000000004] um 100 lines uh together and returns uh

[501.12 - 506.52] those chunks

[502.979 - 507.3] as strings so

[506.52 - 509.599] um

[507.3 - 511.86] the final result

[509.599 - 514.26] will be

[511.86 - 515.94] um a list

[514.26 - 520.74] of strings

[515.94 - 522.44] each string represents 100 lines of the

[520.74 - 525.54] original

[522.44 - 528.4200000000001] okay so this is this is my coding

[525.54 - 530.6999999999999] chatbot assistant that um it uses it

[528.42 - 532.38] also uses gpt4

[530.7 - 534.9590000000001] um you I I tried it you can actually

[532.38 - 537.12] switch it to um

[534.959 - 540.1199999999999] oh it's using the old one

[537.12 - 543.3] hold on now I need to update that

[540.12 - 545.7] hold on hold on that's the wrong model

[543.3 - 547.26] coding chatbot assistant see this is

[545.7 - 549.36] what I mean is someone someone updated

[547.26 - 550.98] it oh no my local one uses the right one

[549.36 - 552.72] so someone updated it with the wrong

[550.98 - 554.94] model and made a bunch of other

[552.72 - 558.48] assumptions and I was just like no this

[554.94 - 562.019] is not this is not what I wanted okay

[558.48 - 564.839] so here we go here's the function python

[562.019 - 567.66] chunk strings line lines equals split oh

[564.839 - 569.399] wow I did it in two lines cool

[567.66 - 572.42] um

[569.399 - 576.24] this functions first splits the string

[572.42 - 579.5] into lines using the delimiter then it

[576.24 - 581.339] uses a list

[579.5 - 584.88] comprehension to create chunks of 100

[581.339 - 586.5] lines each the range yep the result is a

[584.88 - 588.54] list of strings cool

[586.5 - 590.88] excellent excellent excellent so I'm

[588.54 - 592.8] going to go ahead and copy this out

[590.88 - 596.519] oh and another good thing is that uh

[592.8 - 599.88] like well yeah you see how it works all

[596.519 - 603.12] right so we'll go ahead and

[599.88 - 604.92] do that so chunk strings so first we

[603.12 - 607.5] want to just um

[604.92 - 609.959] act equals

[607.5 - 612.06] open file and I've got it named as

[609.959 - 614.899] act.txt

[612.06 - 614.899] just right here

[614.94 - 620.7] um yep

[616.2 - 623.279] oh and also this uh excuse me this this

[620.7 - 624.839] uses a scratch Pad so what I can do is I

[623.279 - 628.32] can actually populate the code that I'm

[624.839 - 629.8800000000001] working on uh

[628.32 - 631.98] over here

[629.88 - 634.62] so now it's aware of what I'm working on

[631.98 - 636.3000000000001] so this scratch Pad is a holdout so

[634.62 - 639.3] rather than giving it the code in

[636.3 - 640.74] sequence the the coding chat bot

[639.3 - 643.9799999999999] actually has

[640.74 - 645.6] a uh it has here let me show you the

[643.98 - 646.9200000000001] system message so here's the

[645.6 - 649.44] instructions your python coding

[646.92 - 651.7199999999999] assistant let me turn on word wrap your

[649.44 - 653.7] python coding assistant etc etc scratch

[651.72 - 656.279] Pad so basically tells you the scratch

[653.7 - 657.9590000000001] Pad is usable you know so that you know

[656.279 - 659.3389999999999] what the user is working on

[657.959 - 661.7399999999999] um so that you can talk about this and

[659.339 - 664.44] this is passed to the chat bot every

[661.74 - 667.6800000000001] time so whatever the conversation is

[664.44 - 668.8800000000001] like that that is in the past

[667.68 - 671.2199999999999] um I don't know if I'm explaining that

[668.88 - 672.8389999999999] well anyways point being is that it see

[671.22 - 676.5790000000001] it can see the code that you're working

[672.839 - 676.5790000000001] on as long as you keep this updated

[677.1 - 681.0600000000001] um okay

[678.0 - 683.22] so that's the first hundred lines

[681.06 - 686.16] um let's go ahead and

[683.22 - 688.8000000000001] see where did it go step one simplify

[686.16 - 692.399] um cool so act equals that and then

[688.8 - 693.959] we'll say chunks equals uh let's see

[692.399 - 697.56] chunk string

[693.959 - 699.66] chunk string act all right so this this

[697.56 - 701.76] basically creates the chunks that we're

[699.66 - 702.42] going to be working on

[701.76 - 705.24] um

[702.42 - 707.64] and that is that

[705.24 - 709.5] let's see I'm gonna need to watch this

[707.64 - 710.88] because

[709.5 - 712.38] um well here let me just show you

[710.88 - 714.36] something real quick so the first

[712.38 - 717.959] hundred lines

[714.36 - 720.12] if we take that over to

[717.959 - 722.64] playground and

[720.12 - 725.94] paste it in here you see that 100 lines

[722.64 - 727.62] is about four thousand tokens so that

[725.94 - 732.48] would obviously be too big for text

[727.62 - 735.54] davinci03 but with with gpt4 we have 8

[732.48 - 737.7] 000 tokens and then with 3.5 16k we have

[735.54 - 740.519] 16 000 tokens so we could actually

[737.7 - 744.24] probably do more but the thing is is

[740.519 - 746.16] that again 3.5 turbo is actually you

[744.24 - 749.1] know what let's try it real quick heck

[746.16 - 751.8] with it heck with it while we're here

[749.1 - 753.899] let's go back over to chat

[751.8 - 755.459] let's give it

[753.899 - 757.38] this chunk

[755.459 - 760.92] because if it can if I can do it faster

[757.38 - 762.779] and cheaper why not why not

[760.92 - 765.0] um and then we need this is our system

[762.779 - 769.92] message we need to make sure that we're

[765.0 - 771.3] going to use 3.5 turbo 16k so that it's

[769.92 - 773.639] got enough space

[771.3 - 775.4399999999999] okay turn the temperature down we do not

[773.639 - 776.88] want you to be creative thank you very

[775.44 - 778.9200000000001] much

[776.88 - 781.88] um all right and then let's see how well

[778.92 - 781.88] it summarizes it

[782.1 - 789.5] um yeah so it's not this summarization

[784.8 - 789.5] is not nearly as elegant or as concise

[789.839 - 796.0790000000001] um but just glancing at it it's okay

[794.579 - 798.66] I think I'm gonna stick with with four

[796.079 - 801.3599999999999] but I'm glad I did this side by side so

[798.66 - 804.36] the the the gpt4 it's a much more

[801.36 - 806.22] elegant summary and it's also less wordy

[804.36 - 808.98] even though so it's not quite as fast

[806.22 - 810.36] and it's not quite as cheap because we

[808.98 - 812.279] need to capture the essence of something

[810.36 - 813.66] that's really important let's use the

[812.279 - 816.6] smarter model

[813.66 - 820.8] uh now that being said again 3.5 turbo

[816.6 - 823.0790000000001] uh the the June 13th one plenty plenty

[820.8 - 825.66] good for a lot of things

[823.079 - 827.9399999999999] Okay cool so I'm glad I ran that test

[825.66 - 829.86] where are we what am I doing

[827.94 - 831.72] I don't know I'm lost

[829.86 - 834.42] I'm always lost

[831.72 - 837.4200000000001] there's this meme it's like a pug in a

[834.42 - 839.579] field with a wizard hat and it says the

[837.42 - 843.4799999999999] the the meme is like not all who wander

[839.579 - 845.519] are lost except Dave is lost as and

[843.48 - 847.74] that's me I am the pug with a wizard hat

[845.519 - 849.48] does that make any sense I need more

[847.74 - 851.639] coffee

[849.48 - 853.26] oh

[851.639 - 854.76] okay all right I hope you find this

[853.26 - 856.2] entertaining because I just woke up and

[854.76 - 858.12] I was like my brain's like hey we should

[856.2 - 860.22] work on this

[858.12 - 862.26] all right now we're back here all right

[860.22 - 864.12] we've got our chunks so now what we need

[862.26 - 866.76] to do so this is this is where it gets

[864.12 - 870.18] fun so uh

[866.76 - 872.7] four Chunk in chunks this is super

[870.18 - 874.68] straightforward uh let's see

[872.7 - 879.12] um messages

[874.68 - 880.92] equals uh this is going to be a list and

[879.12 - 884.76] then the

[880.92 - 886.26] um roll will be whoops

[884.76 - 889.639] user

[886.26 - 889.639] and the content

[890.399 - 895.92] wow I know how to type I promise it's

[893.459 - 897.54] just getting it from my head to the to

[895.92 - 900.36] the hands on the keyboard to the screen

[897.54 - 903.7199999999999] that's too many steps right now

[900.36 - 905.639] content equals chunk okay cool

[903.72 - 908.0400000000001] so basically what we're doing right here

[905.639 - 910.98] is we're setting it up to look exactly

[908.04 - 912.779] like this so I'm I'm putting the Chunk

[910.98 - 914.639] in here and then we also need to load

[912.779 - 916.079] the system message so what we're going

[914.639 - 920.16] to do is we're going to do

[916.079 - 922.9799999999999] um system equals open file uh system

[920.16 - 924.779] underscore summarize so this is this is

[922.98 - 926.279] the instructions

[924.779 - 928.139] um dot text

[926.279 - 929.459] so system message is the new prompt

[928.139 - 932.399] engineering

[929.459 - 934.76] um all right cool so then we'll do uh

[932.399 - 934.76] roll

[935.16 - 940.279] system

[938.04 - 943.079] and content

[940.279 - 944.76] is system

[943.079 - 947.6389999999999] all right so now we're ready to pass it

[944.76 - 951.54] up to our model right here so then we'll

[947.639 - 952.86] just do response equals chat bot

[951.54 - 955.4399999999999] messages

[952.86 - 957.6] ta-da as that simple

[955.44 - 959.82] um so it's ready and so this response is

[957.6 - 961.8000000000001] going to be the summary

[959.82 - 963.9590000000001] and so now I need to figure out how I

[961.8 - 966.899] want to save this save these summaries

[963.959 - 968.399] out in a way that makes sense

[966.899 - 971.3] um

[968.399 - 971.3] let's see

[973.079 - 977.0999999999999] let me ask my chatbot assistant okay

[975.24 - 981.1800000000001] cool

[977.1 - 985.1990000000001] great uh now I want to pass a list of

[981.18 - 991.019] strings to a function and have that

[985.199 - 992.779] function save them to a specified folder

[991.019 - 999.5600000000001] as a parameter

[992.779 - 1002.8389999999999] and I want it to serialize those files

[999.56 - 1004.779] like so

[1002.839 - 1009.74] um so it'll be like

[1004.779 - 1012.68] file001 dot text file zero zero zero two

[1009.74 - 1013.4590000000001] dot text and so on

[1012.68 - 1018.1389999999999] um

[1013.459 - 1021.9399999999999] let's see you should see the script I'm

[1018.139 - 1021.94] working on all right cool

[1022.339 - 1029.179] so then we're gonna we're gonna have um

[1025.339 - 1031.48] summaries equals list and then summaries

[1029.179 - 1034.16] dot append

[1031.48 - 1036.74] response so now basically we're gonna

[1034.16 - 1037.88] have the summaries all in order and what

[1036.74 - 1040.339] I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and

[1037.88 - 1041.8390000000002] paste this into my scratch Pad so that

[1040.339 - 1044.12] the chat bot knows what I'm working on

[1041.839 - 1047.4189999999999] and I'll show you how that it says oh

[1044.12 - 1048.62] okay cool I probably should have told it

[1047.419 - 1050.179] that I'm going to do that with the

[1048.62 - 1052.82] summaries it's usually pretty good at

[1050.179 - 1057.38] making the inference okay cool

[1052.82 - 1059.4189999999999] um let's see def save strings if OS path

[1057.38 - 1061.3400000000001] exists or if it doesn't exist make it

[1059.419 - 1063.44] otherwise enumerate strings

[1061.34 - 1065.84] so as long as I've been using python I'm

[1063.44 - 1068.6200000000001] not entirely sure how enumerate Works

[1065.84 - 1068.62] maybe I should ask

[1068.72 - 1075.58] all right but let's go over here

[1072.14 - 1075.5800000000002] let's go back to my script

[1077.66 - 1081.74] save strings cool

[1080.6 - 1086.6599999999999] um

[1081.74 - 1088.039] file I 05 interesting

[1086.66 - 1089.419] yeah see I'm not even sure how that

[1088.039 - 1091.1] works

[1089.419 - 1093.14] fantastic let's see if it let's see if

[1091.1 - 1095.299] it works though

[1093.14 - 1097.76] um the function first checks that the

[1095.299 - 1100.82] specified folder exists excellent then

[1097.76 - 1102.3799999999999] it uses it to make it then then iterates

[1100.82 - 1104.4189999999999] over the list of strings using enumerate

[1102.38 - 1106.0390000000002] which provides both the index and the

[1104.419 - 1108.2] value oh okay so that's what enumerate

[1106.039 - 1112.22] does the index is used to generate the

[1108.2 - 1114.26] file name with I colon 05 in the F

[1112.22 - 1118.22] string ensuring that the index is zero

[1114.26 - 1119.78] padded to five digits well that was easy

[1118.22 - 1121.52] cool

[1119.78 - 1122.5] um right and then it uses the right

[1121.52 - 1127.52] method

[1122.5 - 1129.32] uh yeah so instead

[1127.52 - 1132.3799999999999] um I want I was hoping it would use my

[1129.32 - 1136.039] save file but that's fine

[1132.38 - 1139.22] um so let's go to here and we're gonna

[1136.039 - 1141.2] do summaries

[1139.22 - 1143.72] and so instead

[1141.2 - 1145.7] we're going to assume that that is

[1143.72 - 1149.679] already there

[1145.7 - 1154.299] and then we are going to do

[1149.679 - 1154.299] file path equals

[1156.08 - 1158.1999999999998] um

[1158.24 - 1164.919] OS path join folder

[1161.66 - 1164.919] yeah that works

[1173.12 - 1177.86] and then

[1175.88 - 1180.3200000000002] we are going to do

[1177.86 - 1181.58] save file because this so my save file

[1180.32 - 1185.0] function

[1181.58 - 1186.799] um encodes it in utf-8 so just reuse

[1185.0 - 1189.32] something rather than do it here because

[1186.799 - 1190.34] you see this doesn't do it in utf-8 you

[1189.32 - 1191.539] want to make sure that you have a nice

[1190.34 - 1192.86] standardized thing that's what I'm doing

[1191.539 - 1197.12] here

[1192.86 - 1200.7199999999998] file path and S so that should be good

[1197.12 - 1204.799] fine all right so save strings

[1200.72 - 1205.82] um so then we do save strings uh we'll

[1204.799 - 1207.559] do

[1205.82 - 1210.86] summaries

[1207.559 - 1213.44] no I need to do yes summaries

[1210.86 - 1215.9599999999998] and then summaries

[1213.44 - 1218.3600000000001] and that should work uh now that being

[1215.96 - 1220.72] said I want to print the response as I

[1218.36 - 1220.7199999999998] get them

[1222.74 - 1226.0] um there we go and then

[1226.22 - 1230.84] response

[1228.2 - 1233.78] all right let's give this a whirl and

[1230.84 - 1237.74] see if it works

[1233.78 - 1240.32] CD what is this EU AI Act

[1237.74 - 1244.0] let's zoom in a little bit

[1240.32 - 1244.0] python stepo one

[1245.72 - 1250.58] so this will probably take a while

[1247.1 - 1254.1399999999999] because we've got three thousand line 3

[1250.58 - 1254.1399999999999] 300 lines there we go cool

[1254.36 - 1259.2199999999998] hmm

[1255.679 - 1261.6200000000001] hold on oh right right right

[1259.22 - 1262.94] forgot about this okay so this is an

[1261.62 - 1264.7399999999998] important thing

[1262.94 - 1266.8400000000001] um what I started doing and I forgot to

[1264.74 - 1269.66] integrate this so what I started doing

[1266.84 - 1272.6] is I when I whenever I called a chat bot

[1269.66 - 1273.74] I return the text and the token use

[1272.6 - 1275.299] um so because this is actually really

[1273.74 - 1277.88] helpful if you just go ahead and return

[1275.299 - 1280.7] the tokens so that you know when to

[1277.88 - 1283.5200000000002] summarize it so instead what I need to

[1280.7 - 1284.78] do is response tokens

[1283.52 - 1287.78] um because I don't need to save I don't

[1284.78 - 1290.4189999999999] need to save a tuple out here

[1287.78 - 1293.48] but this otherwise looks good

[1290.419 - 1295.72] and then what I'm going to do is I'm

[1293.48 - 1298.34] going to go grab

[1295.72 - 1300.919] uh something to make the the printout

[1298.34 - 1302.98] look a little bit better

[1300.919 - 1302.98] um

[1303.5 - 1309.38] reflective journaling tool this one has

[1306.02 - 1313.6] this one has good pretty output

[1309.38 - 1313.6000000000001] so we're going to do formatted lines

[1316.64 - 1322.96] yep

[1318.86 - 1322.9599999999998] so take the formatted lines here

[1328.58 - 1333.9189999999999] and then we'll do

[1330.32 - 1338.1399999999999] rent do I knew my new line

[1333.919 - 1338.14] and formatted lines

[1339.44 - 1343.46] all right so that will that'll make it

[1341.299 - 1345.26] that'll make it prettier and then we'll

[1343.46 - 1346.76] also use

[1345.26 - 1348.62] um so this this is this is why I

[1346.76 - 1352.1589999999999] appreciate when people

[1348.62 - 1354.6789999999999] um uh add feedback is we added uh

[1352.159 - 1357.3200000000002] someone added the Halo which is a little

[1354.679 - 1358.88] like thing that shows that it's thinking

[1357.32 - 1361.059] so I'm going to add that real quick as

[1358.88 - 1361.0590000000002] well

[1362.96 - 1368.08] and the way that you use that is down

[1365.659 - 1368.0800000000002] here

[1374.72 - 1377.6000000000001] and so once once this is running I'll

[1376.52 - 1378.679] pause the video so you don't have to

[1377.6 - 1381.1399999999999] watch the whole thing so you're actually

[1378.679 - 1383.26] probably closer to the end if I had to

[1381.14 - 1383.26] guess

[1386.12 - 1389.4399999999998] oops spinner start

[1391.4 - 1396.3400000000001] so we'll say summarizing next chunk

[1398.36 - 1401.3799999999999] and then spinner stop

[1405.14 - 1409.48] okay so let's try this make sure it

[1407.12 - 1409.4799999999998] works

[1412.46 - 1416.9] summarizing next chunk hey look now it

[1414.74 - 1419.48] gives us some output better user

[1416.9 - 1423.22] experience it tells me what it's doing

[1419.48 - 1425.059] uh text wrap is not defined whoops

[1423.22 - 1428.96] what do you mean I need to import

[1425.059 - 1430.8799999999999] everything that you use import text wrap

[1428.96 - 1432.919] let's try that again

[1430.88 - 1434.3600000000001] third time's a charm all right and if

[1432.919 - 1435.7990000000002] this works then I'll go ahead and pause

[1434.36 - 1437.78] it and then we'll come back once the

[1435.799 - 1438.86] whole video is or once the whole thing

[1437.78 - 1440.559] is done

[1438.86 - 1444.86] uh why is it

[1440.559 - 1447.62] in hold on hold on that's not right

[1444.86 - 1450.8799999999999] why are you giving me this garbage

[1447.62 - 1450.8799999999999] that's not correct

[1452.6 - 1458.5] oh right I need to print out formatted

[1455.059 - 1458.5] text my bad

[1461.179 - 1464.679] don't give me this nonsense

[1464.96 - 1468.559] because basically what you want to do is

[1466.88 - 1470.3600000000001] you want to have it formatted in such a

[1468.559 - 1472.8799999999999] way there we go see so now we have this

[1470.36 - 1474.08] nice little Block it's easier to read

[1472.88 - 1475.5800000000002] um all right cool so this is working

[1474.08 - 1478.52] we'll watch it just a couple times you

[1475.58 - 1481.82] see how fast it is uh the the June 13th

[1478.52 - 1483.799] update is much much faster

[1481.82 - 1487.039] um let's see

[1483.799 - 1488.78] excellent excellent excellent so we will

[1487.039 - 1491.96] I'm gonna pause the video and we'll come

[1488.78 - 1494.74] back and uh and take a look at the final

[1491.96 - 1494.74] result cheers

[1495.32 - 1500.72] okay and we're back

[1497.6 - 1501.6789999999999] so after uh running it all here let me

[1500.72 - 1503.659] just show you what the results were

[1501.679 - 1506.419] we've got

[1503.659 - 1509.2990000000002] 37 files

[1506.419 - 1510.679] um each with a summary and I wrote a

[1509.299 - 1513.62] really quick I hacked together a really

[1510.679 - 1515.8400000000001] quick script that uh merged them all and

[1513.62 - 1518.1789999999999] so the merged result is thirty four

[1515.84 - 1521.36] thousand uh characters long so we

[1518.179 - 1523.7] reduced it by a factor of ten to one uh

[1521.36 - 1526.039] just just shy of ten to one which when

[1523.7 - 1528.98] you plug that in over here that's six

[1526.039 - 1530.6] thousand tokens so we went from from

[1528.98 - 1532.22] sixty thousand or seventy thousand

[1530.6 - 1534.26] tokens I don't remember exactly to six

[1532.22 - 1536.96] thousand tokens one of the reasons that

[1534.26 - 1539.419] we had a more drastic reduction of token

[1536.96 - 1541.279] count is because we removed all the

[1539.419 - 1543.8600000000001] serial numbers and stuff because that's

[1541.279 - 1545.84] kind of Superfluous if you if you remove

[1543.86 - 1548.4799999999998] symbols and stuff like this these are

[1545.84 - 1551.48] high token uh things if it's ordinary

[1548.48 - 1554.6] words like Ai and each system these are

[1551.48 - 1556.94] easy for the model to tokenize so that

[1554.6 - 1558.559] means what we can do now is we can just

[1556.94 - 1562.76] take this whole thing

[1558.559 - 1563.779] and come over to chat and say um let's

[1562.76 - 1569.48] see

[1563.779 - 1573.2] uh uh main purpose uh here darn it

[1569.48 - 1576.7] believe that you are a uh chat bot

[1573.2 - 1581.659] tasked with uh discussing

[1576.7 - 1583.94] uh the following uh legislation with the

[1581.659 - 1587.24] user uh

[1583.94 - 1589.779] make sure to well hell that I mean

[1587.24 - 1593.08] that's all it is uh

[1589.779 - 1596.84] use the legislation

[1593.08 - 1597.9189999999999] summary below to conduct the

[1596.84 - 1601.059] conversation

[1597.919 - 1603.919] and that's it and so then we say uh

[1601.059 - 1606.32] legislation summary

[1603.919 - 1609.14] and we'll copy paste it here

[1606.32 - 1612.02] and so then we move over to we could do

[1609.14 - 1613.22] 16k because that'll be that'll be faster

[1612.02 - 1615.2] um actually here let's try that real

[1613.22 - 1617.779] quick let's try that temperature there

[1615.2 - 1621.679] okay

[1617.779 - 1625.36] um give me a high level overview of this

[1621.679 - 1625.3600000000001] uh legislation

[1628.9 - 1634.8200000000002] after five years

[1631.4 - 1635.919] um how is it funded

[1634.82 - 1637.82] foreign

[1635.919 - 1639.5] let's see the funding and the

[1637.82 - 1640.52] implementation of this legislation comes

[1639.5 - 1642.98] from the multi-annual financial

[1640.52 - 1644.539] framework uh blah blah blah blah the

[1642.98 - 1646.4] financial impact includes allocation of

[1644.539 - 1649.1] resources

[1646.4 - 1649.88] um and having watch that go through how

[1649.1 - 1650.74] many

[1649.88 - 1652.46] um

[1650.74 - 1655.48] employees

[1652.46 - 1655.48] will it cost

[1656.299 - 1660.08] there we go 10 full-time equivalent

[1658.22 - 1664.159] employees

[1660.08 - 1666.26] all right so we can clear that out

[1664.159 - 1669.0200000000002] uh just because it ultimately is

[1666.26 - 1672.1589999999999] Superfluous so some of the questions

[1669.02 - 1677.559] um uh let's see will this legislation

[1672.159 - 1677.5590000000002] hamper research and innovation

[1678.44 - 1682.22] let's see the legislation aims to

[1680.659 - 1683.5390000000002] balance the benefits of AI research and

[1682.22 - 1685.159] Innovation with the need for safety and

[1683.539 - 1686.6589999999999] respect for fundamental rights it

[1685.159 - 1689.2990000000002] includes measures to support Innovation

[1686.659 - 1691.4] such as AI regulatory sandboxes and

[1689.299 - 1693.799] reducing the regulatory burden on smes

[1691.4 - 1695.48] and startups so that smes are going to

[1693.799 - 1697.34] be subject matter experts like you and I

[1695.48 - 1699.26] as well as startups

[1697.34 - 1701.299] the goal is to provide legal certainty

[1699.26 - 1703.52] and prevent Market fragmentation which

[1701.299 - 1705.02] can actually Foster Innovation by

[1703.52 - 1706.52] creating a Level Playing Field for AI

[1705.02 - 1708.5] developers however it imposes certain

[1706.52 - 1710.24] requirements and obligations on

[1708.5 - 1714.159] high-risk AI

[1710.24 - 1718.1200000000001] um how does this legislation Define

[1714.159 - 1718.1200000000001] higher risk AI

[1719.62 - 1725.0] uh let's see the this legislation

[1722.179 - 1726.919] categorizes AI systems into three risk

[1725.0 - 1729.559] levels unacceptable high and low or

[1726.919 - 1731.72] minimal high risk AI is based on their

[1729.559 - 1733.7] intended purpose and usage while the

[1731.72 - 1735.799] specific criteria may vary high risk AI

[1733.7 - 1737.299] generally include those use the safety

[1735.799 - 1740.179] components of products covered by Union

[1737.299 - 1741.44] harmonization legislation as well as AI

[1740.179 - 1743.179] used in critical infrastructure

[1741.44 - 1745.8200000000002] management education vocational training

[1743.179 - 1747.38] employment and workers management these

[1745.82 - 1748.82] high-risk AI systems are subject to

[1747.38 - 1749.72] requirements

[1748.82 - 1751.7] um

[1749.72 - 1754.7] what are unacceptable

[1751.7 - 1754.7] types

[1755.12 - 1758.4189999999999] the legislation prohibits certain AI

[1757.34 - 1760.399] practices that are considered

[1758.419 - 1762.8600000000001] unacceptable due to their potential to

[1760.399 - 1764.559] violate fundamental rights while the

[1762.86 - 1767.299] specific types may vary some examples

[1764.559 - 1769.1589999999999] include manipulate human behavior

[1767.299 - 1771.32] exploit vulnerabilities or enable social

[1769.159 - 1773.659] scoring by public authorities right so

[1771.32 - 1776.26] as I mentioned uh social credit system

[1773.659 - 1779.2990000000002] these practices are deemed harmful

[1776.26 - 1781.179] Freedom dignity democracy quality and

[1779.299 - 1785.2] fundamental rights okay cool

[1781.179 - 1789.14] does this legislation address

[1785.2 - 1794.74] existential risk at all

[1789.14 - 1794.74] um does it address autonomous AI

[1795.02 - 1799.34] the legislation does not explicitly

[1797.299 - 1804.08] address existential risk or autonomous

[1799.34 - 1805.76] AI systems wow okay now one thing that I

[1804.08 - 1808.0] will say is that if you look at the

[1805.76 - 1811.22] legislation it does talk about like

[1808.0 - 1814.94] basically human supervision

[1811.22 - 1819.14] um yeah so like AI regulatory sandbox by

[1814.94 - 1821.779] one or more member stages no like here

[1819.14 - 1824.24] um it where was it it talked about not

[1821.779 - 1826.159] supervision of the sandboxes but like AI

[1824.24 - 1828.14] systems basically need to be steerable

[1826.159 - 1832.0390000000002] it's in there somewhere

[1828.14 - 1833.48] um okay but let's see it does not

[1832.039 - 1834.919] specifically address a potential risk

[1833.48 - 1836.72] associated with highly autonomous or

[1834.919 - 1838.279] super intelligent AI systems that could

[1836.72 - 1839.779] pose existential threats however the

[1838.279 - 1841.58] legislation's emphasis on risk

[1839.779 - 1842.96] management human oversight oh that's

[1841.58 - 1844.58] what it was oversight not supervision

[1842.96 - 1846.46] and robustness requirements for

[1844.58 - 1848.4189999999999] high-risk AI systems indirectly

[1846.46 - 1850.3400000000001] contributes to addressing the safety

[1848.419 - 1852.5590000000002] concerns associated with AI Technologies

[1850.34 - 1854.299] it is important to note that addressing

[1852.559 - 1856.1589999999999] existential risks related to AI may

[1854.299 - 1857.899] require further research discussions on

[1856.159 - 1861.0800000000002] potentially additional regular

[1857.899 - 1864.4399999999998] regulations in the future okay cool

[1861.08 - 1867.32] so there you have it this file is saved

[1864.44 - 1869.3200000000002] as merged.txt

[1867.32 - 1869.32] um

[1869.96 - 1875.3600000000001] let me go ahead and send that up to git

[1872.6 - 1880.6589999999999] so you can all use it uh let's see get

[1875.36 - 1883.6399999999999] status get add get commit am all done

[1880.659 - 1887.5390000000002] get push all right so there you have it

[1883.64 - 1891.0200000000002] you have a uh a much much condensed

[1887.539 - 1893.84] version of of the EU act here and merged

[1891.02 - 1896.539] you can plug it into the playground and

[1893.84 - 1898.34] ask questions to your heart's content if

[1896.539 - 1900.559] you have access to it but otherwise you

[1898.34 - 1901.76] can at least just read it here

[1900.559 - 1904.24] um yeah I think we're all done thanks

[1901.76 - 1904.24] for watching
