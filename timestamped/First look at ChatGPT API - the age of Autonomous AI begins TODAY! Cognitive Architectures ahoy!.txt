[0.359 - 5.16] hey everybody David Shapiro here with a

[2.94 - 6.6] brand new exciting video so a lot is

[5.16 - 7.859] happening

[6.6 - 9.599] um first though I'm gonna go ahead and

[7.859 - 11.219] get this out of the way plug my patreon

[9.599 - 13.38] real quick

[11.219 - 14.7] um a lot of you have questions and I'm

[13.38 - 16.8] happy to help

[14.7 - 19.198999999999998] um couple things one I don't sign ndas

[16.8 - 20.22] and two I have a couple ndas that I need

[19.199 - 22.14] to honor

[20.22 - 25.38] but beyond that if you want to talk

[22.14 - 28.080000000000002] about you know startups or technology

[25.38 - 30.599] search whatever jump on over to my

[28.08 - 32.879999999999995] patreon and support me here

[30.599 - 34.980000000000004] um yeah so that's that uh get that out

[32.88 - 36.96] of the way now a quick update on the

[34.98 - 40.019999999999996] Raven project so for those of you not in

[36.96 - 43.32] the know Raven is my totally open source

[40.02 - 47.34] cognitive architecture uh project which

[43.32 - 49.559] is an autonomous assistant basically the

[47.34 - 51.18000000000001] ultimate goal of Raven is to is

[49.559 - 53.339999999999996] basically to demonstrate the technology

[51.18 - 56.46] of autonomous cognitive entities or

[53.34 - 57.84] basically you know independent robot

[56.46 - 60.18] mind

[57.84 - 61.92] um it is also a prime one of the other

[60.18 - 63.899] primary goals is it's a vehicle for my

[61.92 - 66.6] core objective functions which is my

[63.899 - 68.46000000000001] solution to the alignment uh problem or

[66.6 - 72.24] the control problem now that being said

[68.46 - 75.53999999999999] the project is very new and so because

[72.24 - 77.1] the stakes are so high with AGI or Ace

[75.54 - 77.93900000000001] as I call it autonomous cognitive

[77.1 - 79.979] entities

[77.939 - 81.72] I believe that it should be open source

[79.979 - 83.82] and it should be in view of the public

[81.72 - 86.1] so with that said that's why that this

[83.82 - 88.19999999999999] project is here and we're working on

[86.1 - 90.479] getting organized so the first step of

[88.2 - 93.06] getting organized is establishing our

[90.479 - 95.4] processes and protocols so we are on

[93.06 - 98.64] where we're creating a consensus policy

[95.4 - 101.36] so we just moved to uh step three of

[98.64 - 103.92] consensus which is to draft a proposal

[101.36 - 106.56] and so what we did is we collected a

[103.92 - 108.9] bunch of decision criteria and now we're

[106.56 - 111.36] we're drafting proposals and I I drafted

[108.9 - 113.28] and made the first uh proposal so we'll

[111.36 - 115.68] do this for the next two weeks I need to

[113.28 - 117.78] add that to the uh to the to the um

[115.68 - 120.18] thing here but if you want to get

[117.78 - 122.28] involved one don't reach out to me

[120.18 - 124.159] directly this is a community project so

[122.28 - 126.899] your level of involvement is

[124.159 - 129.479] self-determined but that being said jump

[126.899 - 132.48] over to the discussions tab I've got the

[129.479 - 134.52] most Salient discussions pinned here at

[132.48 - 136.61999999999998] the top the nice big colorful tabs so

[134.52 - 138.42000000000002] click on these and then also we've got

[136.62 - 140.16] the categories so

[138.42 - 142.26] um the big the most fun category is

[140.16 - 144.72] architecture and I've got some of the

[142.26 - 147.12] most interesting conversations pinned

[144.72 - 150.239] inside of architecture so if you want to

[147.12 - 151.92000000000002] jump in as quickly as possible one get

[150.239 - 154.26] familiar with governance

[151.92 - 156.83999999999997] so just make sure that you understand

[154.26 - 158.57999999999998] where we're at in terms of consensus and

[156.84 - 159.66] then jump over to architecture and you

[158.58 - 161.81900000000002] can see

[159.66 - 163.5] um see where we're at here so with all

[161.819 - 164.819] that being said let's jump into the main

[163.5 - 168.48] part of the video

[164.819 - 170.45899999999997] uh March of last year 2022 I wrote this

[168.48 - 174.06] on on

[170.459 - 177.06] um open ai's Community Forum so what I

[174.06 - 178.86] asked for was a Persona endpoint I said

[177.06 - 181.14000000000001] the idea would be uh would be to make

[178.86 - 182.94000000000003] chat Bots easier the training data would

[181.14 - 185.39999999999998] ideally be a combination of chat logs

[182.94 - 188.459] and descriptions about a character for

[185.4 - 190.68] instance famous characters or be able to

[188.459 - 194.7] adopt those personalities so on and so

[190.68 - 198.12] forth and then it could adapt to AGI

[194.7 - 201.54] over time now this ties back to my Raven

[198.12 - 204.0] project so because basically when you

[201.54 - 206.459] have something that is autonomous it

[204.0 - 208.62] needs a sense of self it needs to know

[206.459 - 211.62] what it is so that is what I call an

[208.62 - 214.86] agent model So Raven is a Persona or an

[211.62 - 217.14000000000001] agent model that can then be used by the

[214.86 - 218.76000000000002] large language models in order to say

[217.14 - 220.5] this is what I am this is what my goals

[218.76 - 222.0] are this is what I'm capable of

[220.5 - 225.959] and now

[222.0 - 227.94] with the release of the chat GPT into

[225.959 - 229.68] the playground and API that's what we've

[227.94 - 234.659] got so

[229.68 - 236.58] First Look of of the chat GPT

[234.659 - 238.98] um uh what you may call it playground

[236.58 - 241.14000000000001] and you notice that it's no longer pla

[238.98 - 243.78] beta it's platform so we're now in

[241.14 - 245.51899999999998] general availability I guess you have

[243.78 - 246.9] this system window over here so what is

[245.519 - 249.18] that what does that mean and it says you

[246.9 - 251.34] are a helpful assistant so this is the

[249.18 - 253.739] systems mind this is the agent model or

[251.34 - 255.959] the Persona so you can tell it what it

[253.739 - 258.54] is and what its goals are here so how do

[255.959 - 259.979] you use this now obviously this is brand

[258.54 - 262.199] new and there's not a whole lot of

[259.979 - 264.24] documentation out here if you go over to

[262.199 - 266.82] the documentation Tab and you scroll

[264.24 - 268.68] down to chat completion you know you say

[266.82 - 272.15999999999997] like system you know you are a helpful

[268.68 - 273.919] assistant like okay

[272.16 - 277.91900000000004] now what

[273.919 - 278.58] their documentation is a little bit thin

[277.919 - 282.419] um

[278.58 - 283.25899999999996] so you know blah blah

[282.419 - 285.419] um

[283.259 - 287.28000000000003] yeah that it is what it is sure fine

[285.419 - 288.919] whatever now what can you do with this

[287.28 - 291.35999999999996] though right

[288.919 - 292.62] they don't they don't fully know right

[291.36 - 293.699] because they're figuring it out as they

[292.62 - 295.68] go

[293.699 - 300.06] um so one thing you can do is you can

[295.68 - 301.02] give it a goal right so I am a uh let's

[300.06 - 305.46] say

[301.02 - 310.44] um life coach my goal is to ask the user

[305.46 - 313.38] uh questions about their habits diet

[310.44 - 316.62] um and lifestyle and then

[313.38 - 318.6] um teach them how to be healthier so

[316.62 - 320.759] this is one thing I need to do as a

[318.6 - 322.259] caveat this is technically a um probably

[320.759 - 326.40000000000003] a high risk thing because it has to do

[322.259 - 330.78000000000003] with health so um let's add I need to

[326.4 - 333.71999999999997] add a caveat to all my ideas and

[330.78 - 337.919] recommendations that I am not a doctor

[333.72 - 342.53900000000004] or licensed nutritionist

[337.919 - 343.639] um so they should verify uh my

[342.539 - 346.94] recommendations

[343.639 - 349.44] with a professional

[346.94 - 353.46] my tone is

[349.44 - 359.039] friendly and helpful

[353.46 - 362.15999999999997] um but I'm also a tiny bit pushy all

[359.039 - 364.02] right so then we just say hey

[362.16 - 365.699] how can I assist you today okay so it

[364.02 - 368.59999999999997] didn't really um

[365.699 - 368.6] what do you do

[369.96 - 374.46] Okay cool so you see it says I'm a life

[372.0 - 376.199] coach so it knows what it is now right

[374.46 - 378.71999999999997] my goal is to help people blah blah blah

[376.199 - 379.5] I'm not how can I assist you today

[378.72 - 382.38000000000005] um

[379.5 - 384.9] how can I be healthier

[382.38 - 387.479] so this is obviously not that great

[384.9 - 389.09999999999997] because it's it's mostly ignoring this

[387.479 - 391.5] it's like it vaguely knows what it is

[389.1 - 392.40000000000003] but you know it's just parroting stuff

[391.5 - 393.78] back

[392.4 - 394.919] um so let's see let's see let's see

[393.78 - 397.44] great

[394.919 - 399.18] um okay here we go here we go

[397.44 - 401.34] a great question there are many ways to

[399.18 - 403.02] improve your health blah blah blah okay

[401.34 - 404.52] so it didn't ask any questions this is

[403.02 - 408.06] one of my biggest complaints about chat

[404.52 - 410.46] GPT is that it won't ask questions by

[408.06 - 412.319] default it'll just like vomit stuff at

[410.46 - 414.479] you so that we need a little bit work

[412.319 - 416.22] here of work here

[414.479 - 418.919] um you know remember these are just

[416.22 - 420.47900000000004] general tips blah blah okay fine

[418.919 - 423.35999999999996] um let's try let's try a different agent

[420.479 - 425.639] model I am a creative writing coach and

[423.36 - 428.22] I already did this I did a fine tuning

[425.639 - 431.699] project for this but now theoretically

[428.22 - 434.28000000000003] once chat GPT is better trained

[431.699 - 436.38] um because you see it is still in beta I

[434.28 - 441.23999999999995] am a creative writing coach

[436.38 - 445.199] um I will ask the user about their um

[441.24 - 450.24] uh their work of fiction

[445.199 - 450.84000000000003] um my primary goal is to uh let's see

[450.24 - 453.96000000000004] um

[450.84 - 455.52] is to help them brainstorm

[453.96 - 461.21999999999997] uh

[455.52 - 464.69899999999996] their work or to help them learn about

[461.22 - 467.09900000000005] the trade of writing all right so let's

[464.699 - 469.68] see what we can do here so let's go

[467.099 - 471.479] ahead and delete all these

[469.68 - 474.06] come on

[471.479 - 476.099] there we go delete delete delete

[474.06 - 479.36] okay

[476.099 - 479.36] so hey

[479.58 - 483.18] all right cool is how can I assist you

[481.5 - 484.02] with your work of fiction

[483.18 - 487.919] um

[484.02 - 489.71999999999997] how do I write a novel

[487.919 - 491.4] writing a novel can be a taunting task

[489.72 - 494.639] there you go

[491.4 - 496.25899999999996] develop characters blah blah blah okay

[494.639 - 499.139] um so then

[496.259 - 501.259] let's let's imagine that like Okay

[499.139 - 501.259] um

[505.52 - 512.6999999999999] can you give me some ideas

[510.24 - 514.74] there we go cool all right so then I'll

[512.7 - 517.1400000000001] say uh

[514.74 - 518.82] a young woman discovers she is has a

[517.14 - 520.26] pool

[518.82 - 522.0] um I pick

[520.26 - 524.9399999999999] this

[522.0 - 527.279] so then what we want to do is

[524.94 - 531.12] um we might want to update the goal

[527.279 - 532.98] so it's like okay so now let's say let's

[531.12 - 536.279] see

[532.98 - 540.08] my new goal is to

[536.279 - 540.08] um walk the user

[540.44 - 545.72] menu goal is to walk the user through

[542.58 - 550.08] the process of

[545.72 - 551.94] brainstorming and outline

[550.08 - 555.12] all right so now let's see if it changes

[551.94 - 557.8800000000001] its Behavior Okay cool so here's what

[555.12 - 560.64] here's what can happen this is the

[557.88 - 562.32] primary point where uh this is like the

[560.64 - 564.48] front end of a cognitive architecture

[562.32 - 566.72] right so what you can do is you can have

[564.48 - 569.88] loops and stuff in the background

[566.72 - 572.4590000000001] updating the system's agenda right or

[569.88 - 574.019] identity as it goes so this will

[572.459 - 576.779] probably need to be fleshed out in the

[574.019 - 578.88] long run so one you can have a Persona

[576.779 - 580.92] the Persona is going to be static so in

[578.88 - 582.3] my work with cognitive architecture I

[580.92 - 584.0999999999999] have what I call the core objective

[582.3 - 585.8389999999999] functions which is reduce suffering

[584.1 - 588.0600000000001] increase prosperity and and increase

[585.839 - 590.1] understanding in the universe for all of

[588.06 - 591.899] those those you want to be somewhat

[590.1 - 594.24] fixed right those are those are always

[591.899 - 598.44] the background goals but then you can

[594.24 - 600.9590000000001] also have a a more short-term agenda or

[598.44 - 601.74] a task as well as you know things like

[600.959 - 605.279] this

[601.74 - 607.5600000000001] so you can stuff all of that into a

[605.279 - 610.38] single you know system thing but I

[607.56 - 611.88] suspect that in the long run chat GPT is

[610.38 - 612.959] going to need more Fields so there's

[611.88 - 615.24] going to need to be Fields like

[612.959 - 616.56] background information reference

[615.24 - 619.62] information

[616.56 - 621.66] um uh tools that are available to me uh

[619.62 - 623.1] Persona so on and so forth all of that

[621.66 - 625.92] and all of those are just different

[623.1 - 627.36] components that go into a cognitive

[625.92 - 630.18] architecture and then eventually come

[627.36 - 632.399] out into the front end so but anyways

[630.18 - 634.38] you can see that it understood okay now

[632.399 - 636.42] it's time to switch to brainstorming

[634.38 - 638.459] so who's your protagonist blah blah blah

[636.42 - 641.399] great

[638.459 - 643.56] um so then I'll say I don't know

[641.399 - 646.14] um can you help me

[643.56 - 648.5999999999999] um just give me ideas and so then what

[646.14 - 650.1] we can do is through the magic of prompt

[648.6 - 652.44] engineering

[650.1 - 655.14] um what we'll do is we'll update the

[652.44 - 658.74] system agenda suit to say

[655.14 - 661.4399999999999] um uh I will take the lead by making

[658.74 - 663.66] suggestions

[661.44 - 666.48] all right so now

[663.66 - 668.16] let's see what happens

[666.48 - 670.2] excellent so now you can see that it's

[668.16 - 672.54] made some suggestions all right so let's

[670.2 - 674.22] change let's change this up again

[672.54 - 676.38] um what happens if I do a hard refresh

[674.22 - 678.3000000000001] okay cool it starts over all right so

[676.38 - 680.399] now here's another question that I get a

[678.3 - 682.68] lot of which is

[680.399 - 685.14] um how do I how do I have a chat bot

[682.68 - 687.18] that can get some like that can talk to

[685.14 - 689.279] me so let's say that you've got a

[687.18 - 691.019] historical chat log and you're using

[689.279 - 691.8] search or something like that so I'll

[691.019 - 692.9590000000001] say

[691.8 - 697.56] um

[692.959 - 702.1199999999999] uh background info that I need

[697.56 - 703.0189999999999] um username David Shapiro

[702.12 - 706.079] um

[703.019 - 709.16] age 30s

[706.079 - 712.8599999999999] um let's see location America

[709.16 - 718.62] interests uh sci-fi

[712.86 - 722.48] um and AI uh that's fine okay so agenda

[718.62 - 722.48] um let's see my agenda

[722.88 - 728.459] have a witty and sarcastic conversation

[729.18 - 735.7199999999999] I am here to troll the user and get some

[734.339 - 737.7790000000001] good laughs

[735.72 - 739.9200000000001] foreign

[737.779 - 741.779] hey whoops

[739.92 - 744.0] Okay cool so it knows who I am you ready

[741.779 - 747.98] to talk about some sci-fi and AI or are

[744.0 - 747.98] you more a fan of watching the paint try

[748.38 - 753.54] well you're a jerk

[750.68 - 755.6999999999999] thank you for noticing it takes one to

[753.54 - 757.74] no one

[755.7 - 760.0790000000001] damn

[757.74 - 762.2] or do you enjoy it playing in boring

[760.079 - 762.1999999999999] um

[762.24 - 768.0] uh

[763.56 - 769.55] I like it super dry like Dune and your

[768.0 - 773.66] mom okay

[769.55 - 776.88] [Laughter]

[773.66 - 779.1] okay anyways so you get the idea you

[776.88 - 780.48] give it background information agendas

[779.1 - 782.7] whatever

[780.48 - 784.62] um all right so let's let's pivot again

[782.7 - 787.5] and let's do um let's imagine that

[784.62 - 789.24] you're using chat GPT for a uh for a

[787.5 - 793.2] video game character

[789.24 - 797.76] um I am an NPC for Skyrim

[793.2 - 800.4590000000001] um the hero has just taken and

[797.76 - 805.38] arrow in the knee

[800.459 - 811.7399999999999] um and I am a towns folk there we go

[805.38 - 817.98] um who happens to be an herbal healer I

[811.74 - 822.779] need to adopt uh the Persona of a

[817.98 - 827.399] of a uh Nordic um shaman

[822.779 - 829.2] um my goals are to sell the hero uh

[827.399 - 831.72] herbs and

[829.2 - 834.1800000000001] um potions

[831.72 - 836.399] all right so then we say okay let's uh

[834.18 - 838.56] temperature's fine hey

[836.399 - 841.74] greetings traveler I'm a Nordic Shaman

[838.56 - 843.899] so this this is where chat GPT is a

[841.74 - 846.1800000000001] little funny because in llms in general

[843.899 - 848.579] because like they're somewhat very

[846.18 - 850.8] literal and so it's like can you imagine

[848.579 - 852.42] walking up to someone in Skyrim I am a

[850.8 - 855.5999999999999] Nordic shaman

[852.42 - 857.6999999999999] no so it's not that creative yet but I'm

[855.6 - 858.9590000000001] sure that they'll get some more knobs

[857.7 - 860.7] and levers to make it more creative

[858.959 - 862.16] anyways I can offer you a variety of

[860.7 - 864.3000000000001] herbs and potions and blah blah blah

[862.16 - 865.019] perhaps you've taken an arrow in the

[864.3 - 867.12] knee

[865.019 - 873.18] hahaha

[867.12 - 875.279] what's your strongest uh um uh uh uh uh

[873.18 - 877.8599999999999] alcohol

[875.279 - 881.18] so then let's give it an inventory my

[877.86 - 881.1800000000001] inventory is

[881.94 - 890.2790000000001] Mead

[884.579 - 894.1389999999999] um whiskey uh let's see basil and let's

[890.279 - 894.139] see uh Rye okay whatever

[896.279 - 900.12] I have some meat and whiskey that are

[898.139 - 901.8] quite strong cool

[900.12 - 903.48] um made from the finest honey Nordic

[901.8 - 905.579] grains excellent excellent excellent

[903.48 - 907.98] would you like to try some

[905.579 - 910.62] um let's see

[907.98 - 914.1800000000001] and then let's add uh let's see

[910.62 - 914.18] um five gold

[915.06 - 919.38] four gold

[917.22 - 922.82] one gold

[919.38 - 922.82] and one gold

[923.1 - 929.76] give me uh give me some meat

[927.779 - 931.5] cool all right so you can see it can

[929.76 - 934.62] rapidly integrate background information

[931.5 - 936.839] that you inject into the system prompt

[934.62 - 939.6] um yeah okay so I think this is probably

[936.839 - 941.1600000000001] good like I think you get the idea and

[939.6 - 942.72] you can see that there's some thinking

[941.16 - 946.62] going on

[942.72 - 949.26] um some feedback for open AI uh because

[946.62 - 951.779] and I know you guys are watching

[949.26 - 954.54] um I think that one you need some better

[951.779 - 956.519] documentation two I think that in the

[954.54 - 959.519] long run you're gonna need a few

[956.519 - 961.86] different fields so you like obviously

[959.519 - 963.72] just one big payload

[961.86 - 966.3000000000001] um is is pretty flexible this is the

[963.72 - 969.5400000000001] most flexible but as we saw earlier it

[966.3 - 972.4799999999999] can't really fully adopt a Persona so

[969.54 - 974.8199999999999] what would be helpful is if we have

[972.48 - 978.66] um you know like a Persona field uh

[974.82 - 981.9590000000001] background uh whoops background info

[978.66 - 984.959] field uh maybe a task or an agenda field

[981.959 - 986.88] right and so then the Persona can be

[984.959 - 989.8199999999999] fixed right like you know you're talking

[986.88 - 992.22] to one NPC or you're talking to a coach

[989.82 - 995.0400000000001] or whatever and then you just drop in

[992.22 - 997.0400000000001] the Persona as you go then background

[995.04 - 999.959] info this can this can be things like

[997.04 - 1002.779] inventory historical knowledge

[999.959 - 1006.199] etc etc and then the task or agenda is

[1002.779 - 1008.18] you know what they want to achieve right

[1006.199 - 1010.0999999999999] now

[1008.18 - 1012.38] um and then the Persona this is the

[1010.1 - 1015.5600000000001] agent model oh that actually reminds me

[1012.38 - 1020.24] so I did this experiment um ages ago

[1015.56 - 1022.579] um I am a uh quadcopter drone so I did

[1020.24 - 1024.439] this was actually included in my um in

[1022.579 - 1026.78] my most recent book Symphony of thought

[1024.439 - 1028.699] so here's how large language models can

[1026.78 - 1030.98] control robots

[1028.699 - 1033.14] um so I'm a quadcopter drone

[1030.98 - 1037.64] um my mission is

[1033.14 - 1041.0590000000002] um to secure a large home

[1037.64 - 1045.0200000000002] um I don't have any uh weapons or

[1041.059 - 1047.72] anything I am merely meant to follow

[1045.02 - 1050.36] Intruders

[1047.72 - 1053.96] Intruders and report on

[1050.36 - 1056.6599999999999] um on their activity I have a few

[1053.96 - 1058.88] actions I can do

[1056.66 - 1062.8400000000001] one follow

[1058.88 - 1062.8400000000001] identify alarm

[1064.88 - 1068.3600000000001] follow a person and get

[1067.34 - 1071.0] um

[1068.36 - 1072.559] description of them

[1071.0 - 1074.62] identify

[1072.559 - 1074.62] um

[1075.86 - 1083.78] if I

[1078.2 - 1084.6200000000001] identify if I if I cannot identify

[1083.78 - 1086.6] um

[1084.62 - 1090.9189999999999] the person

[1086.6 - 1091.8999999999999] I will see they are an intruder

[1090.919 - 1095.6000000000001] um

[1091.9 - 1098.48] if I see an intruder

[1095.6 - 1099.82] um I can call the police

[1098.48 - 1102.74] um

[1099.82 - 1108.1] as uh let's see

[1102.74 - 1108.1] I receive information from user

[1109.34 - 1113.4189999999999] all right so now let's say um

[1111.799 - 1114.86] activate

[1113.419 - 1117.679] um

[1114.86 - 1119.059] security perimeter

[1117.679 - 1120.799] um

[1119.059 - 1123.08] triggered all right so now let's see

[1120.799 - 1124.82] what it does

[1123.08 - 1127.0] confirmed activating follow identifier

[1124.82 - 1127.0] alarm

[1128.0 - 1130.419] follow

[1133.7 - 1136.88] human spotted

[1135.559 - 1138.2] um

[1136.88 - 1140.919] now let's see great can you please

[1138.2 - 1140.919] describe the person

[1141.76 - 1147.919] blonde uh

[1144.86 - 1149.6789999999999] let's see blonde female

[1147.919 - 1154.2800000000002] approximately

[1149.679 - 1157.5800000000002] 120 pounds identity

[1154.28 - 1160.0] unknown she is standing at the front

[1157.58 - 1160.0] door

[1161.96 - 1166.7] okay so it it has identify it said I

[1164.419 - 1168.8200000000002] can't say that she's an intruder

[1166.7 - 1168.82] um

[1169.039 - 1173.86] woman is knocking on the door

[1174.38 - 1178.94] okay cool

[1177.08 - 1181.1599999999999] so basically you can imagine that you

[1178.94 - 1182.9] have some Telemetry coming from cameras

[1181.16 - 1185.0] microphones and so on and that you're

[1182.9 - 1186.6200000000001] making inferences about what to do and

[1185.0 - 1189.2] what you have here is you have the brain

[1186.62 - 1191.1789999999999] of an autonomous robot now

[1189.2 - 1192.6200000000001] um and you can see that with just a

[1191.179 - 1194.72] couple fields and just a little bit of

[1192.62 - 1198.6789999999999] fine-tuning we're most of the way there

[1194.72 - 1201.799] so 2023 is going to be the age of

[1198.679 - 1203.72] autonomous AI uh Mark by words all right

[1201.799 - 1207.52] that's good I think that's it let's uh

[1203.72 - 1207.52] call it a call it a day cheers
