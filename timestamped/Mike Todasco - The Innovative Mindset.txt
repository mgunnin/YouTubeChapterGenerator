[62.52 - 68.58] look I'm you know my 60 seconds I I was

[66.18 - 72.0] born and and raised in the suburbs of

[68.58 - 75.0] Chicago kind of grew up uh as a child in

[72.0 - 78.24] the 80s collecting comic books and

[75.0 - 79.64] sports cards and things like that and uh

[78.24 - 83.88] eventually put my way through college

[79.64 - 86.22] doing that uh when I left college and

[83.88 - 87.479] entered the real world I started off as

[86.22 - 90.65899999999999] an accountant and I was probably the

[87.479 - 94.259] world world's worst accountant in many

[90.659 - 97.68] ways moved on to the very sexy industry

[94.259 - 99.299] known as paper manufacturing

[97.68 - 101.4] um so literally and this was right at

[99.299 - 102.54] the time of like the office so I

[101.4 - 105.54] couldn't tell you the amount of like

[102.54 - 107.759] under Mifflin jokes I heard over time

[105.54 - 109.97900000000001] um but uh I learned a lot of like

[107.759 - 112.86] interesting things in a in a very old

[109.979 - 114.72] arcade industry and and just had tons of

[112.86 - 117.06] insights from there I actually love to

[114.72 - 120.0] get an MBA

[117.06 - 123.24000000000001] um started a e-commerce company after

[120.0 - 125.88] that uh on selling original artwork

[123.24 - 127.19999999999999] called sketch Maven and after doing that

[125.88 - 130.85999999999999] for a few years

[127.2 - 133.58] join PayPal and I was at PayPal for 10

[130.86 - 136.44000000000003] and a half years before leaving recently

[133.58 - 138.3] uh doing a lot of things in product and

[136.44 - 140.57999999999998] for the last five running their

[138.3 - 142.98000000000002] innovation.org

[140.58 - 145.02] excellent yeah I mean such such a

[142.98 - 147.959] fascinating background and and so many

[145.02 - 150.36] people uh come come to you know

[147.959 - 152.4] technology and today AI from just such a

[150.36 - 155.22000000000003] diverse background I want to pick your

[152.4 - 157.5] brain about like what was it what was it

[155.22 - 159.239] like being the the world's worst

[157.5 - 161.94] accountant and then switching to paper

[159.239 - 163.379] and then switching to like what was what

[161.94 - 164.57999999999998] was that what was that choice because I

[163.379 - 166.319] mean obviously like going back and

[164.58 - 167.94000000000003] getting an MBA like it sounds like you

[166.319 - 169.79999999999998] might have just realized like man I took

[167.94 - 171.66] I took a wrong turn I need to backtrack

[169.8 - 174.06] is that is that kind of what happened

[171.66 - 179.099] yeah I mean look part of it I mean

[174.06 - 182.04] specifically on the the MBA was we had I

[179.099 - 184.379] was living in Ohio when I got out of

[182.04 - 186.54] school and and that's where I met my

[184.379 - 189.72] wife and we had an opportunity to move

[186.54 - 191.76] out to California which was awesome and

[189.72 - 194.159] so when we moved out here it was for her

[191.76 - 196.92] job I continued to work for my company I

[194.159 - 198.89999999999998] was working remotes uh for my company

[196.92 - 202.07999999999998] back in Ohio and frankly I didn't know

[198.9 - 203.70000000000002] anybody out here and going back to

[202.08 - 205.31900000000002] school and getting an MBA was frankly my

[203.7 - 207.11999999999998] way to meet people

[205.319 - 209.159] um I was able to do it through my

[207.12 - 210.72] employers I was doing it part time while

[209.159 - 213.659] I was there but it was just a way to

[210.72 - 215.34] meet people and network and all of that

[213.659 - 217.79999999999998] wonderful stuff

[215.34 - 220.08] um as part of the process

[217.8 - 222.739] I'll pause there because I think David

[220.08 - 222.739] died

[227.4 - 231.12] hey there there you go yeah I finished

[229.08 - 232.739] my sentence but then I was like oh is

[231.12 - 235.31900000000002] this gonna I think it's still recording

[232.739 - 237.48000000000002] through all of it so I closed the wrong

[235.319 - 239.7] tab I apologize I was trying to reduce

[237.48 - 242.04] distractions and then I reduce all the

[239.7 - 243.23899999999998] distractions to zero so no it should it

[242.04 - 245.04] should still be recording and if not

[243.239 - 246.48000000000002] we'll clean it up in the no it seemed to

[245.04 - 248.04] record through the whole thing and like

[246.48 - 249.959] I said I kind of just finished the

[248.04 - 252.06] thought on um

[249.959 - 255.0] um coming out and doing my MBA to meet

[252.06 - 257.639] people excellent excellent yeah so so

[255.0 - 259.68] you used it to to meet people to to get

[257.639 - 261.29900000000004] ahead to stand out in the crowd and

[259.68 - 264.84000000000003] clearly it worked you know you were able

[261.299 - 266.88] to do a a a a e-commerce platform sketch

[264.84 - 268.08] Maven and then eventually to PayPal but

[266.88 - 269.759] you said that there was a some

[268.08 - 271.919] interesting things that you learned at

[269.759 - 273.96000000000004] sketch Maven so what are some stories

[271.919 - 276.53999999999996] from from your uh your first e-commerce

[273.96 - 281.03999999999996] Venture yeah so

[276.54 - 282.90000000000003] sketch Maven was something look I

[281.04 - 285.47900000000004] recommend this for everybody like just

[282.9 - 287.94] have an ideologue that you keep I've

[285.479 - 290.75899999999996] been doing this since I was at least an

[287.94 - 292.56] undergrad I'm 45 now so like this is a

[290.759 - 295.139] long time I've been just kind of keeping

[292.56 - 297.0] a list of the ideas that I have and

[295.139 - 299.759] ideas for whatever because like you

[297.0 - 301.919] never want a good idea or a bad idea of

[299.759 - 304.68] go to waste and every good idea starts

[301.919 - 305.639] as a bad idea and I just remember one

[304.68 - 308.639] time

[305.639 - 311.1] as a kid I went to Comic in in baseball

[308.639 - 313.02] card and sports card conventions selling

[311.1 - 315.0] stuff and I'd be a dealer and so forth

[313.02 - 318.419] and I remember going to this one

[315.0 - 321.12] convention uh boy early 90s or something

[318.419 - 324.479] and seeing an artist there and the

[321.12 - 326.78000000000003] artist had a cover of a um of a Green

[324.479 - 329.94] Lantern comic book that I really liked

[326.78 - 332.21999999999997] and to give you a background on this so

[329.94 - 333.9] at least back in the day before things

[332.22 - 335.16] went digital

[333.9 - 337.979] um every

[335.16 - 340.5] comic book you have ever seen in your

[337.979 - 341.34] life came from a hand-drawn piece of

[340.5 - 344.46] artwork

[341.34 - 346.46] and even though that comic book has may

[344.46 - 349.56] have been viewed by millions of people

[346.46 - 351.59999999999997] multiple times there's only one original

[349.56 - 353.759] from which that came

[351.6 - 357.72] and so it creates this really unique

[353.759 - 359.639] problem where for every comic book piece

[357.72 - 362.1] of artwork that has ever existed there's

[359.639 - 364.199] one and only one of them but there are

[362.1 - 367.259] millions and tens of millions of these

[364.199 - 370.02000000000004] pages and covers and so forth of that

[367.259 - 372.84000000000003] so it's a very unique problem

[370.02 - 375.65999999999997] um in that space and when I was a kid

[372.84 - 378.35999999999996] and saw this this cover I was like oh um

[375.66 - 379.86] you know it was 150 bucks I think it was

[378.36 - 381.539] I'm like I didn't quite have that money

[379.86 - 383.639] I had some decent money I was selling a

[381.539 - 385.8] lot of stuff but I didn't have 150 bucks

[383.639 - 388.16] to blow on a piece of artwork you know

[385.8 - 391.8] when I'm like 13 years old or something

[388.16 - 394.91900000000004] especially back in the 90s so

[391.8 - 396.419] when I was fast forward I'm an

[394.919 - 398.58] accountant so I'm actually making real

[396.419 - 400.139] money out there in the workforce and so

[398.58 - 401.94] probably I was like it just dawned me

[400.139 - 404.34000000000003] I'm like wow I should go buy that thing

[401.94 - 405.71999999999997] go on eBay can't find it go on all these

[404.34 - 406.919] other places you can't find it I don't

[405.72 - 407.94000000000005] know where this thing is I don't know

[406.919 - 410.46] where it is

[407.94 - 412.74] and that's the reality when there's only

[410.46 - 415.31899999999996] one of something in the world

[412.74 - 418.02] it's really hard to find where that

[415.319 - 420.06] thing is and when there's like I said

[418.02 - 421.85999999999996] millions of these ones

[420.06 - 423.78000000000003] well then like that's sort of an

[421.86 - 425.94] interesting problem and that's what

[423.78 - 428.84] birthed the concept for sketch may even

[425.94 - 432.9] it was a very structured marketplace

[428.84 - 435.419] where people could buy and sell and even

[432.9 - 438.9] say that they want and desire certain

[435.419 - 443.52] pieces of original comic book art I

[438.9 - 445.56] started the business in 2009 and

[443.52 - 447.06] you know and it was a Marketplace like

[445.56 - 448.68] because most of these things were being

[447.06 - 450.84] sold on eBay at the time and I think

[448.68 - 452.819] even today in very many ways they still

[450.84 - 454.08] are some artists have their own sites

[452.819 - 456.41900000000004] and so forth but there was nowhere to

[454.08 - 458.52] find it if I wanted to tell the world I

[456.419 - 461.15999999999997] wanted this Green Lantern cover there

[458.52 - 463.31899999999996] was no way to actually do so

[461.16 - 466.91900000000004] um and honest and so this was an idea I

[463.319 - 469.08000000000004] had 10 years prior 2009 I'm going

[466.919 - 471.12] through my idea file and I'm like oh

[469.08 - 473.639] that's interesting I wonder if anyone's

[471.12 - 475.02] done that lo and behold knots and I'm

[473.639 - 476.52] like well maybe this is something that I

[475.02 - 478.44] should build I don't really care about

[476.52 - 481.34] the Green Lantern cover anymore to be

[478.44 - 484.319] completely honest but but

[481.34 - 486.479] uh the concept's still held true and I

[484.319 - 488.34000000000003] felt that if this could work for a niche

[486.479 - 490.86] that I understood like original comic

[488.34 - 492.23999999999995] art well it could definitely work for

[490.86 - 494.819] other things

[492.24 - 497.46000000000004] um like pens and collectible shoes and

[494.819 - 499.199] sneakers and things like that

[497.46 - 501.71999999999997] um where I felt that they were vastly

[499.199 - 502.52000000000004] underserved by eBay and other sites at

[501.72 - 505.44000000000005] the time

[502.52 - 507.35999999999996] and you know in some ways that thesis

[505.44 - 509.46] proved out you know there's goats and

[507.36 - 511.62] stockx and so forth that now do damn

[509.46 - 514.38] shoes it's probably about five years too

[511.62 - 515.88] early as those launched uh you know much

[514.38 - 517.62] later

[515.88 - 518.9399999999999] um but you know as I was building the

[517.62 - 522.3] site it was my first experience ever

[518.94 - 525.24] building something I was on upwork which

[522.3 - 527.16] was known at oh as odesk at the time I

[525.24 - 530.339] was hiring people everything from PR

[527.16 - 533.2199999999999] people to engineers and so forth I was

[530.339 - 535.5600000000001] just figuring out stuff myself

[533.22 - 538.6800000000001] um this was even before like Braintree

[535.56 - 541.26] and stripe mind you so I remember like

[538.68 - 544.019] having Engineers work and help build the

[541.26 - 546.3] sites and and a few days before launch

[544.019 - 548.04] and I look and I'm going through the

[546.3 - 550.5] checkout myself and

[548.04 - 553.8] you know I'm like there's no little lock

[550.5 - 555.06] icon in the for the shopping cart when

[553.8 - 557.64] people are entering their credit card

[555.06 - 560.04] information and again this is like

[557.64 - 561.98] stripe took care of that like you don't

[560.04 - 565.3199999999999] even need to worry about that anymore

[561.98 - 567.24] 2009 uh that was a problem and I'm like

[565.32 - 569.22] oh God I didn't write that in the spec

[567.24 - 572.1] document for the engineers to actually

[569.22 - 573.899] say yes this needs to be secure and so

[572.1 - 575.94] on and so forth

[573.899 - 579.18] um and so is all of these fun things so

[575.94 - 581.94] it was an amazing two-year ride that had

[579.18 - 583.9799999999999] to deal you know happy customers unhappy

[581.94 - 586.2] customers hackers all this wonderful

[583.98 - 588.54] stuff uh that I learned about in my in

[586.2 - 592.62] my two years there

[588.54 - 593.519] excellent yeah I mean so it I mean

[592.62 - 594.779] there's so much there's so much to

[593.519 - 596.279] unpack there because like you know you

[594.779 - 599.279] had an idea file you came back to it

[596.279 - 601.5] after 10 years right and that probably

[599.279 - 603.0] especially for some of the younger

[601.5 - 604.92] audience members who are just getting

[603.0 - 606.779] into you know just cutting their teeth

[604.92 - 609.0] on AI and startups and stuff just the

[606.779 - 610.62] idea of you know you jot all this stuff

[609.0 - 612.3] down do you have any like let's start

[610.62 - 614.279] there like do you have any pro tips on

[612.3 - 616.56] you know keeping ideas you said all good

[614.279 - 617.88] ideas start as bad ideas and in this

[616.56 - 619.4399999999999] case there was something that you wanted

[617.88 - 621.48] right that was kind of the Genesis of

[619.44 - 622.74] this but then like then we'll unpack

[621.48 - 624.12] some of the Lessons Learned but let's

[622.74 - 626.64] start let's start there with the the

[624.12 - 627.9590000000001] ideas the brainstorming how did how did

[626.64 - 629.459] you decide that like this was something

[627.959 - 631.14] you were going to build

[629.459 - 632.0999999999999] oh how do I decided something I was

[631.14 - 633.72] going to build

[632.1 - 636.4200000000001] um because it intrigued me I I mean

[633.72 - 638.64] again I remember this I remember you

[636.42 - 640.4399999999999] know being a kid and seeing this and

[638.64 - 642.959] then I remember writing it down you know

[640.44 - 646.019] 10 years later and then 10 years of give

[642.959 - 647.9399999999999] or take after that going back and saying

[646.019 - 650.1] oh I'm sure somebody has already done

[647.94 - 653.22] that like like that was my gut reaction

[650.1 - 655.14] I'm like oh I'm sure this exists this is

[653.22 - 656.94] a no-brainer this has to exist in the

[655.14 - 659.279] world doing a little bit of research and

[656.94 - 660.12] be like huh it doesn't and again mind

[659.279 - 662.399] you

[660.12 - 664.079] just because something already exists in

[662.399 - 666.3] the world doesn't mean that you

[664.079 - 668.76] shouldn't do your own version of it so I

[666.3 - 671.8199999999999] want to be really really clear

[668.76 - 674.76] um you know Google was the 30th 40th

[671.82 - 676.98] major search engine that launched

[674.76 - 678.48] um it was in plenty of people said like

[676.98 - 680.82] why does the world need another search

[678.48 - 682.44] engine they just you know using page

[680.82 - 685.0790000000001] Rank and other things they just had a

[682.44 - 687.12] better and more Innovative way of doing

[685.079 - 688.92] things so just because something exists

[687.12 - 690.54] doesn't mean you shouldn't

[688.92 - 693.12] um but to me that was just a really

[690.54 - 695.2199999999999] interesting tell in in a way of just

[693.12 - 697.92] saying oh this is something I like this

[695.22 - 698.519] is something I'm passionate about

[697.92 - 701.76] um

[698.519 - 704.1] I want to go through this ride and you

[701.76 - 705.66] know the I I should just go along and do

[704.1 - 707.22] more analysis and I remember then going

[705.66 - 710.9399999999999] to conventions

[707.22 - 713.1600000000001] talking to artists talking to collectors

[710.94 - 715.3800000000001] just talking to people like hey how are

[713.16 - 716.76] you how are you buying stuff and new

[715.38 - 718.56] people were using eBay I knew people

[716.76 - 720.959] were using like a site called comic art

[718.56 - 722.5189999999999] fans and and others and just doing the

[720.959 - 724.1999999999999] research seeing what's out there and

[722.519 - 727.26] just doing a lot of deep customer work

[724.2 - 729.0600000000001] and just asking a lot of questions

[727.26 - 731.459] um and from that you start to formulate

[729.06 - 734.399] what the solution is and there's one

[731.459 - 736.56] thing I've learned in ideating and

[734.399 - 740.399] building out a business it's don't fall

[736.56 - 742.68] in love with your idea fall in love with

[740.399 - 745.2] your customer I mean that's really

[742.68 - 749.579] important for people to know

[745.2 - 751.26] because your idea is going to change and

[749.579 - 753.66] to my fault when I was first building

[751.26 - 754.92] this I probably didn't change enough I

[753.66 - 757.1999999999999] didn't pivot enough I probably didn't

[754.92 - 759.3] listen customers enough I mean I was

[757.2 - 762.4200000000001] doing it some like I feel I'm much wiser

[759.3 - 764.88] now and wouldn't make that same mistake

[762.42 - 767.04] um but I think that's a really big thing

[764.88 - 769.079] and from there you just you just keep

[767.04 - 770.76] iterating and and just figure out like

[769.079 - 772.4399999999999] okay well what are the hard things for

[770.76 - 774.36] me to do the hard thing for me in this

[772.44 - 776.339] was building out the website because I

[774.36 - 780.48] never done that and like I said it was

[776.339 - 781.86] this was before oh like even oh gosh I

[780.48 - 783.72] even remember

[781.86 - 786.779] one of the reasons I ultimately took a

[783.72 - 789.5400000000001] job at PayPal in 2011. it was because

[786.779 - 792.06] PayPal saved my butt in 2009. I actually

[789.54 - 794.04] remember I did uh credit card processing

[792.06 - 795.959] originally I signed up with an account

[794.04 - 797.8199999999999] through Costco

[795.959 - 800.399] Avalon I think was the name of the

[797.82 - 801.899] processor at the time signed up ready to

[800.399 - 804.06] go and then all of a sudden like three

[801.899 - 806.519] weeks before launch they reached out to

[804.06 - 808.92] me like uh is this a Marketplace yeah we

[806.519 - 811.44] don't do marketplaces and I'm like what

[808.92 - 812.6999999999999] like did I tell you that like I don't

[811.44 - 814.3800000000001] know what happened like I didn't even

[812.7 - 815.94] take one dollar of payments I was

[814.38 - 817.32] already paying them 30 bucks a month and

[815.94 - 820.0790000000001] they're like yeah never mind we don't do

[817.32 - 821.7600000000001] you you're you're too risky to us

[820.079 - 823.68] um and then frankly I knew I had some

[821.76 - 825.36] friends at PayPal they're like yeah yeah

[823.68 - 826.9799999999999] we'll we'll take care of you don't worry

[825.36 - 828.66] and they were and they they saved my

[826.98 - 831.24] butt and that's why I think two years

[828.66 - 833.1] later as being a Merchants for PayPal's

[831.24 - 835.38] credit card processing I was like oh

[833.1 - 838.6800000000001] this was a very logical place for for me

[835.38 - 840.36] to enter the next part of my journey

[838.68 - 841.2199999999999] but yeah I I'm sorry I went on a little

[840.36 - 843.9590000000001] side

[841.22 - 845.639] side rant there are you good like

[843.959 - 847.8] hopefully that still gets to the the

[845.639 - 850.44] root of the question I mean I think when

[847.8 - 852.3599999999999] you're ideating like again you want as

[850.44 - 853.8000000000001] big of a funnel in in the beginning as

[852.36 - 856.86] possible you want as many ideas as

[853.8 - 858.5999999999999] possible and you want to just then give

[856.86 - 862.26] it some time get away from those ideas

[858.6 - 864.72] then come back to them a day a week 10

[862.26 - 866.7] years later whatever it is and see what

[864.72 - 868.019] resonates see what still holds true and

[866.7 - 870.0600000000001] then you start to do the research and

[868.019 - 874.92] Analysis

[870.06 - 877.3199999999999] absolutely you know as as a fledgling uh

[874.92 - 879.3] you know startup Tech startup guy myself

[877.32 - 881.94] everything that you said is is what

[879.3 - 883.3199999999999] people tell me it's what I read and but

[881.94 - 884.639] the way that you said it one thing that

[883.32 - 886.139] you said really stood out to me which

[884.639 - 887.76] was don't fall in love with your product

[886.139 - 890.88] or your idea fall in love with your

[887.76 - 892.92] customer and that I think is so critical

[890.88 - 894.36] and so important and I realized as soon

[892.92 - 895.9799999999999] as you said it you're absolutely right

[894.36 - 898.26] because one of the things that I'm

[895.98 - 900.779] working on is auto Muse which is for

[898.26 - 902.76] writers and it's like this is for

[900.779 - 905.459] writers it's you know I have ideas about

[902.76 - 907.56] what I want to build but no I I did

[905.459 - 910.8] exactly what you said which is I talked

[907.56 - 912.7199999999999] to writers screenplay uh writers I've

[910.8 - 913.92] talked to actors now

[912.72 - 915.1800000000001] um all kinds of stuff but I don't want

[913.92 - 918.06] to make this about me I just wanted to

[915.18 - 920.16] agree and reinforce that at that point

[918.06 - 922.199] um well I'm sorry just one one last

[920.16 - 923.9399999999999] thing on that like for anybody who wants

[922.199 - 924.66] to go deeper into this I will give a

[923.94 - 928.0790000000001] plug

[924.66 - 930.0] um Adobe had created an open source

[928.079 - 932.06] something called kickbox

[930.0 - 934.139] and So for anybody could go to

[932.06 - 937.56] kickbox.org it's totally it's open

[934.139 - 940.0790000000001] source it's free anyone can download it

[937.56 - 942.959] um it is kind of a way to go from

[940.079 - 944.76] ideation to business launch uh when I

[942.959 - 946.8] worked at PayPal we actually took a

[944.76 - 949.68] version We modified it and used it

[946.8 - 952.3199999999999] internally as well and it is an amazing

[949.68 - 955.4399999999999] tool that anyone can use and I probably

[952.32 - 957.779] take that that quote directly from

[955.44 - 960.3000000000001] kickbox so I do want to give do credit

[957.779 - 962.519] to them but um that's a great tool if

[960.3 - 964.5] anybody does want to go deeper uh into

[962.519 - 966.0] like how do you do this how do you

[964.5 - 967.98] really make it so you fall in love with

[966.0 - 970.5] your customer and and not get too

[967.98 - 973.6800000000001] focused on your specific solution

[970.5 - 975.54] excellent perfect yeah and uh thanks for

[973.68 - 977.3389999999999] thanks for that sharing that resource um

[975.54 - 979.019] we'll have to unpack that a little bit

[977.339 - 981.4200000000001] later too if we get if we get back

[979.019 - 983.279] around to it uh so one thing that you

[981.42 - 986.2199999999999] mentioned just a few minutes ago while

[983.279 - 988.079] while building uh sketch Maven was you

[986.22 - 990.24] know there's the the little snafu around

[988.079 - 992.66] payments you've had happy customers

[990.24 - 995.04] unhappy customers and then uh you know

[992.66 - 996.42] writing specs for engineers and kind of

[995.04 - 998.0999999999999] forgetting a few things here and there

[996.42 - 999.8389999999999] so what what were some of the

[998.1 - 1001.279] interesting stories or lessons learned

[999.839 - 1002.839] about like you know kind of doing

[1001.279 - 1004.459] everything yourself or pulling it all

[1002.839 - 1006.019] together and just kind of you know

[1004.459 - 1009.4399999999999] things that you learned the hard way I

[1006.019 - 1011.72] guess is a way yeah I I mean look I I

[1009.44 - 1013.1600000000001] think so many people I talk to I'm not

[1011.72 - 1015.74] technical again I started as an

[1013.16 - 1017.42] accountant I I I understand technology

[1015.74 - 1020.6] fairly well and I've always been

[1017.42 - 1023.06] fascinated by it but you know I I wasn't

[1020.6 - 1024.439] technical per se and I remember so many

[1023.06 - 1027.559] people I was meeting with like hey you

[1024.439 - 1030.0790000000002] need a technical co-founder and I was

[1027.559 - 1031.819] you know going to school up here at

[1030.079 - 1034.1] Berkeley at the time so there's a lot of

[1031.819 - 1036.9189999999999] technical people up there um you know

[1034.1 - 1038.9589999999998] getting my MBA and I actually remember

[1036.919 - 1041.959] interviewing a bunch of people

[1038.959 - 1045.079] I want somebody with the technical shops

[1041.959 - 1046.88] um kind of the passion for the space and

[1045.079 - 1049.8799999999999] there was one other thing I was looking

[1046.88 - 1051.2] for but basically passion for space was

[1049.88 - 1053.0] the one thing we had in common and then

[1051.2 - 1054.98] they were trying to plug gaps where I

[1053.0 - 1059.299] had deficiencies that's what you want in

[1054.98 - 1061.58] your co-founder and I really

[1059.299 - 1063.2] um I think I was being too picky like

[1061.58 - 1064.76] with hindsight like I was looking for

[1063.2 - 1066.74] the perfect person I interviewed a bunch

[1064.76 - 1069.02] of people I was you know very conscious

[1066.74 - 1071.66] I'm like ah I could do it myself like I

[1069.02 - 1073.28] I got this I could be a solopreneur I

[1071.66 - 1075.559] don't need to raise Venture money right

[1073.28 - 1077.84] now for this like I I'm gonna go off and

[1075.559 - 1079.94] do this thing on my own so you know I

[1077.84 - 1081.4399999999998] think mistake number one was not doing

[1079.94 - 1083.539] that because

[1081.44 - 1085.7] as I had mentioned I had a bunch of

[1083.539 - 1089.179] people on on upwork that were building

[1085.7 - 1090.8600000000001] this site and

[1089.179 - 1092.7800000000002] you know even though I didn't put that

[1090.86 - 1095.299] in the specs that's hey you're building

[1092.78 - 1097.3999999999999] a checkout you need to make sure it's

[1095.299 - 1099.62] secure so on and so forth

[1097.4 - 1101.96] it should have been known like any

[1099.62 - 1103.8799999999999] decent engineering team would have like

[1101.96 - 1106.039] kind of called that out and say like hey

[1103.88 - 1108.14] I don't see this in the specs are you

[1106.039 - 1111.26] sure that is right because every

[1108.14 - 1113.1200000000001] checkout we've ever like no and you know

[1111.26 - 1115.039] I wasn't paying that much money because

[1113.12 - 1116.4189999999999] I didn't look I was funding this out of

[1115.039 - 1119.24] my own pocket I didn't have a lot of

[1116.419 - 1120.919] money to do that uh but any great CTO

[1119.24 - 1123.26] would have caught these things much

[1120.919 - 1125.9] earlier and even if they weren't doing

[1123.26 - 1128.179] the engineering work themselves they

[1125.9 - 1129.5] would have you know orally a portion of

[1128.179 - 1133.039] it and far they would have been able to

[1129.5 - 1134.12] manage it much much tighter so at some

[1133.039 - 1136.76] point

[1134.12 - 1138.1399999999999] you know the site was getting decent

[1136.76 - 1140.66] traction

[1138.14 - 1143.419] decent not great but but decent and

[1140.66 - 1145.94] maybe about six months out so most of my

[1143.419 - 1147.6200000000001] focus at that time at post launch was on

[1145.94 - 1148.76] marketing activities and things like

[1147.62 - 1151.58] that that's where you want to be you

[1148.76 - 1153.2] want to be growth mode how do I how do I

[1151.58 - 1155.96] make our customers happy how do we get

[1153.2 - 1157.039] more inventory on the site uh within a

[1155.96 - 1159.26] Marketplace do you always want the

[1157.039 - 1161.12] balance between buyers and sellers to be

[1159.26 - 1162.74] someone in line because they're always

[1161.12 - 1165.5] going to be a little bit out of whack

[1162.74 - 1167.36] and it's sort of hard to to you know

[1165.5 - 1168.32] keep that in balance as you're moving

[1167.36 - 1170.539] forward

[1168.32 - 1172.82] but about six months in

[1170.539 - 1174.679] I remember waking up one morning and

[1172.82 - 1176.6599999999999] going out to the site like wow a bunch

[1174.679 - 1178.46] of new people signed up and I'm like

[1176.66 - 1181.039] the hell are these people

[1178.46 - 1182.6000000000001] and then that's when I realized I'm like

[1181.039 - 1184.82] oh

[1182.6 - 1186.98] um these are these aren't legit accounts

[1184.82 - 1190.22] these are Bots these are spam like this

[1186.98 - 1191.96] like the site's getting hacked like and

[1190.22 - 1193.7] there's there's some there are some

[1191.96 - 1196.64] interesting things ever going on there

[1193.7 - 1198.98] was some seeds and so forth um there are

[1196.64 - 1201.679] malicious code where I personally had to

[1198.98 - 1203.419] roll some stuff back on the site I don't

[1201.679 - 1204.6200000000001] think it was built very securely and God

[1203.419 - 1206.72] knows what we were doing with people's

[1204.62 - 1209.059] credit card information and so forth on

[1206.72 - 1213.08] this thing with hindsights

[1209.059 - 1216.02] um so all of that said like it was a bit

[1213.08 - 1218.72] of a mess and I went from spending you

[1216.02 - 1222.44] know 10 20 of my time worried about

[1218.72 - 1225.02] security I.T infrastructure to you know

[1222.44 - 1227.419] 80 90 percent and when you're trying to

[1225.02 - 1228.679] grow a business that's not where you

[1227.419 - 1230.66] want to be

[1228.679 - 1232.4] um you know the one silver lining you

[1230.66 - 1234.6200000000001] know I give so much credit to my my

[1232.4 - 1236.24] sister-in-law for just reframing my

[1234.62 - 1240.1399999999999] thinking on this

[1236.24 - 1242.059] I I remember seeing her and the rest of

[1240.14 - 1244.22] the family over the holidays and being

[1242.059 - 1246.26] just kind of really like depressed like

[1244.22 - 1247.7] oh gosh like I'm doing this and all of a

[1246.26 - 1250.039] sudden all there's all these hackers on

[1247.7 - 1252.38] there and all fourth and she and her

[1250.039 - 1254.059] response to me was well at least you

[1252.38 - 1255.5] built a site that was important enough

[1254.059 - 1258.34] for them to hack

[1255.5 - 1261.38] and I'm like okay

[1258.34 - 1262.76] there is a silver lining in that only if

[1261.38 - 1264.919] it really was you know the very

[1262.76 - 1268.16] beginning they weren't hacking again so

[1264.919 - 1270.3200000000002] forth so like there's somebody in Russia

[1268.16 - 1273.5] or wherever it was who was truly taking

[1270.32 - 1275.6] the time uh to do this so that was an

[1273.5 - 1276.86] interesting Silver Lining uh to put on

[1275.6 - 1278.36] all this

[1276.86 - 1279.62] um but just the amount of time I spent

[1278.36 - 1281.8999999999999] on that where it could have been on

[1279.62 - 1283.8799999999999] growth it was just such a lack of focus

[1281.9 - 1285.919] that I think it really started to kind

[1283.88 - 1287.0590000000002] of derail where the business could have

[1285.919 - 1289.64] been going

[1287.059 - 1291.62] that makes sense yeah and uh and and

[1289.64 - 1293.6000000000001] yeah you know like success is a

[1291.62 - 1295.58] double-edged sword right like the more

[1293.6 - 1297.32] the more popular you are or the more

[1295.58 - 1299.539] well-known the bigger of a Target you

[1297.32 - 1301.6399999999999] are for any number of things right well

[1299.539 - 1303.44] was it Sergey Brennan um said uh success

[1301.64 - 1305.44] breeds litigation

[1303.44 - 1305.44] um

[1305.84 - 1310.3999999999999] you know or or in this case Uh Russian

[1308.12 - 1312.1399999999999] hackers is what it attracts so that's

[1310.4 - 1314.659] right that's right exactly

[1312.14 - 1317.539] definitely an apocryphal or not

[1314.659 - 1319.0390000000002] apocryphal um uh allegorical story about

[1317.539 - 1320.6589999999999] how important it is to have security

[1319.039 - 1322.7] done right but as you mentioned earlier

[1320.659 - 1325.0390000000002] there's a lot of services like stripe

[1322.7 - 1328.159] that makes these things just out of the

[1325.039 - 1330.62] box much more secure and much safer so I

[1328.159 - 1331.88] guess I have two two directions I want

[1330.62 - 1334.34] to go and I'll let you pick which one we

[1331.88 - 1336.2600000000002] go first so in terms of where the

[1334.34 - 1337.52] industry is today you know the tools

[1336.26 - 1339.86] that are available the platforms that

[1337.52 - 1341.72] are available uh alternatively you did

[1339.86 - 1344.36] mention like a CTO could have helped you

[1341.72 - 1346.28] catch this so uh I'll let you pick path

[1344.36 - 1347.4189999999999] a or pack path B which which you want to

[1346.28 - 1349.8799999999999] talk about first

[1347.419 - 1351.5] oh like basically you're saying if I

[1349.88 - 1353.14] were to recreate this site today how

[1351.5 - 1355.82] would I do it or what would I get it

[1353.14 - 1359.0590000000002] yeah if you if you had all the tools

[1355.82 - 1361.039] today you were 10 years younger and uh

[1359.059 - 1362.6] and and you know had all the lessons

[1361.039 - 1366.46] though what would you what would you do

[1362.6 - 1369.3799999999999] differently I don't think I'd hire a CTO

[1366.46 - 1371.72] I know I I gave this whole speech

[1369.38 - 1373.3400000000001] basically saying how like oh that was

[1371.72 - 1375.679] the biggest mistake I think at the time

[1373.34 - 1378.08] it was the biggest mistake and look I

[1375.679 - 1381.14] wouldn't say I wouldn't hire a CTO but I

[1378.08 - 1383.0] was I would say it's not required to

[1381.14 - 1383.8400000000001] have a CTO because you're absolutely

[1383.0 - 1385.76] right

[1383.84 - 1388.1] um between

[1385.76 - 1390.44] all of the services you know there's

[1388.1 - 1392.539] some fairly good no code Solutions out

[1390.44 - 1394.64] there as well and I was getting a little

[1392.539 - 1396.32] bit into the code myself so I was able

[1394.64 - 1398.8400000000001] to tweak things here or there where

[1396.32 - 1400.58] there wasn't like a CMS solution I was

[1398.84 - 1403.3999999999999] able to kind of figure things out it was

[1400.58 - 1406.28] all built in PHP and you know I was able

[1403.4 - 1408.74] to do a lot with that but you know for

[1406.28 - 1411.46] security with stripe or Braintree and

[1408.74 - 1414.86] other products like that like

[1411.46 - 1418.64] it's never been easier to start a

[1414.86 - 1421.28] website today and so like

[1418.64 - 1426.14] I think you could probably build that

[1421.28 - 1426.1399999999999] site that I had created for

[1426.679 - 1432.98] 15 20 of the cost of what it cost me to

[1429.98 - 1434.72] do that uh in probably a half the time

[1432.98 - 1435.919] if not even less the other is probably

[1434.72 - 1437.299] gonna be a little bit of engineering

[1435.919 - 1439.8200000000002] support that you would need to maybe

[1437.299 - 1443.0] integrate some pieces but for the most

[1439.82 - 1445.46] part you could have this amazing secure

[1443.0 - 1447.559] system built with the existing tools

[1445.46 - 1450.32] that are out there today

[1447.559 - 1452.8999999999999] excellent yeah like and and so I think

[1450.32 - 1457.46] that that's just such a fascinating

[1452.9 - 1459.2] um you know uh point which is uh you

[1457.46 - 1461.659] know if there are folks out there and

[1459.2 - 1463.64] with you know historical you know like

[1461.659 - 1465.38] me I'm I'm talking with people I'm

[1463.64 - 1467.96] reading books I'm you know reading blog

[1465.38 - 1469.88] posts watching videos but things are

[1467.96 - 1471.74] changing things are different today than

[1469.88 - 1474.0800000000002] even they were 10 years ago or five

[1471.74 - 1476.659] years ago and so I just thanks for

[1474.08 - 1479.059] thanks for that that perspective

[1476.659 - 1480.38] um I had a I had a thought but it ran

[1479.059 - 1484.34] off

[1480.38 - 1486.7990000000002] um let's see looking at my notes oh yeah

[1484.34 - 1488.9599999999998] um so kind of kind of rewinding a little

[1486.799 - 1492.1399999999999] bit you had some interesting stories uh

[1488.96 - 1495.98] of your time at PayPal uh specifically

[1492.14 - 1497.539] as um as a leader of innovation so would

[1495.98 - 1498.799] you mind uh walking us through some of

[1497.539 - 1500.96] the stuff that you did at PayPal and

[1498.799 - 1503.36] what you learned about innovation in the

[1500.96 - 1506.1200000000001] tech space uh while you were there

[1503.36 - 1509.539] absolutely yeah and look I I spent 10

[1506.12 - 1511.82] and a half amazing years at PayPal so

[1509.539 - 1513.62] um as as sketch me even the business the

[1511.82 - 1515.96] the marketplace I was running was not

[1513.62 - 1518.2399999999998] kind of succeeding I actually my wife

[1515.96 - 1519.6200000000001] and I had our first kid and it's kind of

[1518.24 - 1521.24] like ah is this really what I didn't

[1519.62 - 1523.9399999999998] want to be doing I'm like I I kind of

[1521.24 - 1525.74] need a I need to rethink about what I'm

[1523.94 - 1527.419] doing and get a steady paycheck have

[1525.74 - 1528.86] money flowing in instead of flowing out

[1527.419 - 1530.72] for a while

[1528.86 - 1533.7199999999998] um you know where should I go work I

[1530.72 - 1536.1200000000001] live in San Jose uh

[1533.72 - 1538.64] biking distance away from PayPal's

[1536.12 - 1540.3799999999999] headquarters and

[1538.64 - 1541.94] um I had a bunch of friends that were

[1540.38 - 1543.8600000000001] there I was a customer of it I always

[1541.94 - 1545.6000000000001] liked I mean I signed up back when they

[1543.86 - 1548.4189999999999] were bribing you with money in the year

[1545.6 - 1550.279] 2000 uh as a consumer

[1548.419 - 1552.919] um you know they like literally that was

[1550.279 - 1554.48] PayPal's when when you know for people

[1552.919 - 1556.159] who don't know the story one of the

[1554.48 - 1558.679] reasons why PayPal got to the scale it

[1556.159 - 1561.2600000000002] did is because they were such flush they

[1558.679 - 1562.3400000000001] were so flush with Venture money

[1561.26 - 1564.62] um and they needed to build Network

[1562.34 - 1566.84] effects for this to be effective buyers

[1564.62 - 1568.52] and sellers so

[1566.84 - 1570.08] um they were just giving and at one

[1568.52 - 1573.44] point it was up to 20 bucks a person

[1570.08 - 1575.8999999999999] just for signing up uh for an account I

[1573.44 - 1578.6000000000001] think I got in around ten dollars when

[1575.9 - 1580.299] when I first got my PayPal accounts but

[1578.6 - 1584.4189999999999] I was look I was a long time customer

[1580.299 - 1586.279] and from my class at Berkeley I

[1584.419 - 1588.74] literally knew 10 people that were

[1586.279 - 1590.36] working there and they all talked really

[1588.74 - 1592.82] favorably

[1590.36 - 1595.1] um so 2011 rolls around I'm looking for

[1592.82 - 1598.1] a job I see this this opportunity pop

[1595.1 - 1600.9189999999999] open on the mobile team at PayPal and

[1598.1 - 1603.9189999999999] I'm like oh mobile has a future

[1600.919 - 1607.279] um which was a

[1603.919 - 1610.4] uh I know now that sounds like of course

[1607.279 - 1612.62] Mike mobile has a future in 2022 when

[1610.4 - 1614.48] you're looking back at that but in 2011

[1612.62 - 1616.039] even this was a few years after the

[1614.48 - 1617.659] iPhone still

[1616.039 - 1619.94] um there was some real traction but

[1617.659 - 1622.94] there's still a lot of skepticism

[1619.94 - 1624.5] um just a tiny tiny portion of

[1622.94 - 1627.799] transactions were being done at mobile

[1624.5 - 1630.08] devices even at that time even in a

[1627.799 - 1632.179] company like PayPal I would have that it

[1630.08 - 1634.22] was way under one percent of total

[1632.179 - 1638.539] payment volume was on mobile devices

[1634.22 - 1641.3600000000001] back in 2010 2011. and um

[1638.539 - 1642.44] so I had a really I was like well let me

[1641.36 - 1644.4799999999998] go interview

[1642.44 - 1646.88] um uh basically my interview at PayPal

[1644.48 - 1649.94] was talking about nothing but failures

[1646.88 - 1651.44] that I had at sketch Maven and um

[1649.94 - 1653.48] because that was my only Tech experience

[1651.44 - 1655.64] and look I was very open I was talking

[1653.48 - 1656.6] about like what I learned uh I was very

[1655.64 - 1659.0] candid

[1656.6 - 1660.98] uh another Pro interview tip that I'll

[1659.0 - 1662.6] give to anybody is actually listen to

[1660.98 - 1664.22] the earning if you're ever interviewing

[1662.6 - 1667.039] at a public company whether you are

[1664.22 - 1670.159] going for a finance role or or an

[1667.039 - 1672.3799999999999] engineer or a lawyer or whatever listen

[1670.159 - 1675.2] to the earnings call beforehand because

[1672.38 - 1678.0800000000002] 98 of employees don't listen to earnings

[1675.2 - 1680.1200000000001] calls and if you listen to an earnings

[1678.08 - 1682.76] call you will hear directly from the CEO

[1680.12 - 1685.1] and CFO and others in the company what

[1682.76 - 1686.84] they really care about what are the

[1685.1 - 1689.059] pressing things and you will actually

[1686.84 - 1691.3999999999999] have in some way more insight than the

[1689.059 - 1694.6399999999999] other people that you're talking to and

[1691.4 - 1696.74] just by doing that painful couple hour

[1694.64 - 1700.64] exercise maybe listen to the last two

[1696.74 - 1702.799] earnings calls you will have a whole new

[1700.64 - 1705.5] insight that it'll almost be like a

[1702.799 - 1707.179] superpower that you will have just being

[1705.5 - 1709.159] able to kind of talk about some of these

[1707.179 - 1710.779] things that the person working there is

[1709.159 - 1712.4] like how did you know about that well

[1710.779 - 1715.1] it's a public company it's on the

[1712.4 - 1717.38] earnings call so anyway Pro tip for

[1715.1 - 1719.8999999999999] anybody interview

[1717.38 - 1721.22] um but uh yeah so there's whatever

[1719.9 - 1723.8200000000002] reason they gave me a job I was

[1721.22 - 1726.74] dangerously unqualified for in analytics

[1723.82 - 1729.9189999999999] and I you know

[1726.74 - 1732.08] it was it was an amazing ride there I I

[1729.919 - 1734.0590000000002] had job after job that I was completely

[1732.08 - 1737.1789999999999] not qualified for but I was just wanting

[1734.059 - 1739.279] to try things out I was always ambitious

[1737.179 - 1741.38] um I always wanted to do what's best for

[1739.279 - 1743.0] the for the customer what's best for the

[1741.38 - 1745.0390000000002] team even if it wasn't in my job

[1743.0 - 1746.36] description and I think I'm in some ways

[1745.039 - 1748.22] maybe I built up a little bit of a

[1746.36 - 1749.1399999999999] reputation for doing that within the

[1748.22 - 1751.039] company

[1749.14 - 1754.4] and

[1751.039 - 1756.74] um fast forward a few years we were

[1754.4 - 1758.679] splitting from eBay so at the time I

[1756.74 - 1761.419] joined PayPal was actually owned by eBay

[1758.679 - 1764.3600000000001] uh 2015

[1761.419 - 1766.3400000000001] um Carl Icahn comes in buys up a bunch

[1764.36 - 1769.6399999999999] of eBay stocks saying hey you are going

[1766.34 - 1772.279] to be worth more separates and

[1769.64 - 1773.8400000000001] um you know eBay management fights at

[1772.279 - 1775.76] fights it fights it and finally one day

[1773.84 - 1777.02] we come into work and say ah never mind

[1775.76 - 1779.72] we're going to split into two companies

[1777.02 - 1781.52] like whoa that's weird uh so when that

[1779.72 - 1784.22] happens PayPal has to create all these

[1781.52 - 1785.6] functions and so forth and I was doing a

[1784.22 - 1787.46] lot of things which we could get to in a

[1785.6 - 1790.1] bit that were pretty Innovative and and

[1787.46 - 1791.659] related to Innovation and

[1790.1 - 1793.6399999999999] um had a just really unique opportunity

[1791.659 - 1796.22] to kind of create a very small

[1793.64 - 1798.2] Innovation function but the Innovation

[1796.22 - 1800.48] function for what the new company was

[1798.2 - 1802.5800000000002] going to be and

[1800.48 - 1804.74] um and so that's kind of how I got

[1802.58 - 1806.779] involved in Innovation at PayPal and

[1804.74 - 1809.779] that was like my last five six years

[1806.779 - 1812.0] there was all within that same job kind

[1809.779 - 1813.799] of defining what Innovation the culture

[1812.0 - 1815.899] of innovation for the company looking at

[1813.799 - 1819.559] new products and new technologies that

[1815.899 - 1821.2399999999998] are emerging uh and and really working

[1819.559 - 1824.5] with employees across the company I'm

[1821.24 - 1824.5] building all that stuff out

[1824.72 - 1829.46] wonderful wonderful story yeah and it's

[1827.84 - 1831.3799999999999] it sounds like it was just a really

[1829.46 - 1833.059] fascinating time like you know I've

[1831.38 - 1835.0390000000002] learned I learned a couple a couple

[1833.059 - 1836.779] interesting things like I I didn't I did

[1835.039 - 1838.76] not know that uh Carl Icahn was the one

[1836.779 - 1840.32] who came in and said let's split this up

[1838.76 - 1842.6589999999999] and that you know because you'd think

[1840.32 - 1845.059] like from an outsider perspective like

[1842.659 - 1846.6200000000001] eBay is this big powerful tech company

[1845.059 - 1848.6589999999999] like why would they allow this to be

[1846.62 - 1851.12] spun out but it was like someone else

[1848.659 - 1852.98] said no if you grow apart you can be

[1851.12 - 1854.84] more valuable so that I mean that in and

[1852.98 - 1856.94] of itself is a little bit innovative

[1854.84 - 1859.1589999999999] but and one thing I will say is Carl

[1856.94 - 1861.679] Icahn was right like I mean I mean it's

[1859.159 - 1864.2600000000002] like you know as much as we don't like

[1861.679 - 1866.419] to give credit to you know and often

[1864.26 - 1868.94] deservedly so to like Financial

[1866.419 - 1871.94] corporate Raider types and so forth he

[1868.94 - 1873.74] was absolutely right like when it splits

[1871.94 - 1875.6000000000001] um when it was clear that was happening

[1873.74 - 1876.98] like PayPal is now uh I don't know what

[1875.6 - 1879.3799999999999] it is exactly probably worth at least

[1876.98 - 1881.6] double what eBay is at one point it was

[1879.38 - 1883.279] way more but things have all been kind

[1881.6 - 1885.98] of trending down

[1883.279 - 1888.38] um but like I I think that was it was

[1885.98 - 1890.179] pretty clear that both companies I think

[1888.38 - 1891.919] were actually stronger being able to

[1890.179 - 1894.2] focus on these different things and

[1891.919 - 1896.48] PayPal could actually as they just have

[1894.2 - 1898.1000000000001] done like can do things with Amazon and

[1896.48 - 1900.559] so forth when it was part of eBay it

[1898.1 - 1902.6] really couldn't do that eBay's even done

[1900.559 - 1904.7] things for their own payment systems and

[1902.6 - 1907.6999999999998] so forth so each company now operates

[1904.7 - 1910.88] truly independently years later so so

[1907.7 - 1913.039] yes Carl Icahn was right yeah sorry

[1910.88 - 1914.3600000000001] excellent yeah no great great story and

[1913.039 - 1916.039] great Point like you never know how

[1914.36 - 1918.3799999999999] things are going to turn out and and

[1916.039 - 1920.539] Lessons Learned you move on and it

[1918.38 - 1922.7600000000002] sounds like both benefited that's not

[1920.539 - 1924.62] always the case of course uh but you did

[1922.76 - 1926.539] you said that you spent the last five

[1924.62 - 1930.02] years or so

[1926.539 - 1931.7] um uh at PayPal focusing on Innovation

[1930.02 - 1933.5] and and you know a couple things that

[1931.7 - 1935.8990000000001] you mentioned that you did to focus on

[1933.5 - 1937.159] that was you talked to people a lot you

[1935.899 - 1938.6589999999999] know across the whole organization

[1937.159 - 1940.7] probably out of the organization outside

[1938.659 - 1943.279] of the organization too and you worked

[1940.7 - 1945.8600000000001] in the mobile space so uh if you could

[1943.279 - 1948.2] like paint us a picture for for me and

[1945.86 - 1950.6] the audience if someone wants to be

[1948.2 - 1952.279] Innovative or be in that space what is

[1950.6 - 1955.279] the mindset you need what are the

[1952.279 - 1956.84] behaviors you need like just like let's

[1955.279 - 1959.12] take a deep dive into the Innovative

[1956.84 - 1961.6999999999998] brain and from your perspective

[1959.12 - 1963.5] oh I love this this is where this is

[1961.7 - 1964.1000000000001] where I really enjoy talking

[1963.5 - 1965.899] um

[1964.1 - 1967.2199999999998] so what does the Innovative brain look

[1965.899 - 1969.5] like the Innovative brain first and

[1967.22 - 1972.38] foremost is just really curious it is

[1969.5 - 1975.26] constantly asking why it is the brain in

[1972.38 - 1977.2990000000002] many ways of a six-year-old just like

[1975.26 - 1979.34] why does that work that way why is it

[1977.299 - 1982.279] that we you know

[1979.34 - 1983.9599999999998] um you know like why do some clothes

[1982.279 - 1985.94] have tags on it but other ones are

[1983.96 - 1987.5] printed on is it a cost thing is it

[1985.94 - 1989.3600000000001] whatever just being naturally curious

[1987.5 - 1991.22] about everything that you see out there

[1989.36 - 1993.32] in the world

[1991.22 - 1996.38] um and then

[1993.32 - 1999.3799999999999] you know so so part and and I mentioned

[1996.38 - 2001.24] before like you want a big funnel of

[1999.38 - 2002.919] ideas because you never know what is

[2001.24 - 2006.64] going to hit

[2002.919 - 2008.74] um Thomas Edison I would love to

[2006.64 - 2011.74] talk about Thomas Edison like you know

[2008.74 - 2014.26] he he has like 1100 patents that he had

[2011.74 - 2016.36] and we know in convinced that light bulb

[2014.26 - 2018.64] and phonograph and all those things that

[2016.36 - 2020.559] are kind of famous now if you go down

[2018.64 - 2022.0] the long tail of those patents and mind

[2020.559 - 2024.34] you these are the things that they

[2022.0 - 2026.38] actually were granted patents by the

[2024.34 - 2029.3799999999999] USPTO we're not even seeing the ideas

[2026.38 - 2031.0] that were rejected that never even

[2029.38 - 2032.7990000000002] they're like oh this is ridiculous don't

[2031.0 - 2035.14] file on it when you start to go down the

[2032.799 - 2037.779] long tail of patents that I uh Edison

[2035.14 - 2039.159] has there's one specifically

[2037.779 - 2041.559] um you know anybody could go out there

[2039.159 - 2043.8400000000001] and Google like Thomas Edison baby dump

[2041.559 - 2045.76] and you will see like he built this

[2043.84 - 2046.86] talking have you seen the save it like

[2045.76 - 2051.04] yeah

[2046.86 - 2054.46] baby doll and this thing is horrific it

[2051.04 - 2056.44] is like it's evil it is like and it has

[2054.46 - 2058.179] like this weird wax cylinder thing that

[2056.44 - 2060.2200000000003] you play and it's supposed to talk to a

[2058.179 - 2061.899] kid and it's like what the it is the

[2060.22 - 2064.06] most god-awful thing and they're like oh

[2061.899 - 2066.0989999999997] yeah that's the Light Bulb Guy

[2064.06 - 2068.56] um but do you know what like who knows

[2066.099 - 2070.119] what that led to like again I mean he's

[2068.56 - 2072.04] just always thinking of ideas and

[2070.119 - 2074.08] they're not all going to be they're not

[2072.04 - 2076.419] all going to be home runs but like

[2074.08 - 2077.56] when you're coming up with ideas the

[2076.419 - 2080.08] first thing to I'm gonna use a baseball

[2077.56 - 2083.2] on another baseball analogy here but

[2080.08 - 2085.419] like you it batting average does not

[2083.2 - 2086.98] matter like that is not what matters so

[2085.419 - 2088.5989999999997] batting average for everyone so in

[2086.98 - 2090.339] baseball you come up to the plate you

[2088.599 - 2093.76] want to hit the ball get it into play

[2090.339 - 2095.919] and get on base that is called a hit all

[2093.76 - 2098.98] the times you don't do that is called an

[2095.919 - 2100.5989999999997] out relatively speaking so if you're a

[2098.98 - 2103.42] great baseball player

[2100.599 - 2105.1600000000003] um 30 of the time you're going to be

[2103.42 - 2106.839] able to get a hits of the times you're

[2105.16 - 2108.94] out there if you're a bad baseball

[2106.839 - 2112.18] player you know 20 of the time or even

[2108.94 - 2115.18] 25 percent necessarily uh to do that

[2112.18 - 2117.5789999999997] and but that's not the game that's being

[2115.18 - 2120.8799999999997] played here nobody cares about that

[2117.579 - 2122.92] statistic in the world of innovation all

[2120.88 - 2125.02] that we care about is home runs and

[2122.92 - 2126.7000000000003] Grand Slams like when you like basically

[2125.02 - 2130.18] hit it so hard it goes out of the entire

[2126.7 - 2134.0789999999997] stigma type stuff that is what matters

[2130.18 - 2135.52] um and so to do that if that is what is

[2134.079 - 2138.2200000000003] being measured

[2135.52 - 2142.06] do we care if you did it in three at

[2138.22 - 2146.68] bats or 3 000 at bats if all that we're

[2142.06 - 2147.94] measuring for is home runs and we just

[2146.68 - 2149.2599999999998] wanna that's the only thing that we care

[2147.94 - 2151.7200000000003] about well it doesn't actually matter

[2149.26 - 2155.44] how many times it took to do that

[2151.72 - 2157.359] so that is something that is really even

[2155.44 - 2159.52] when I had my first Innovation job it

[2157.359 - 2162.16] was something with with my own manager

[2159.52 - 2164.44] at the time was something I really had

[2162.16 - 2166.7799999999997] to hammer home of like we want to

[2164.44 - 2168.579] actually reward how many times people

[2166.78 - 2171.7000000000003] step up to the plate

[2168.579 - 2173.02] so we you know and I'm just gonna it's

[2171.7 - 2176.22] not the only thing but I'm gonna use

[2173.02 - 2179.92] patents as a proxy So

[2176.22 - 2181.5989999999997] within PayPal the year before I joined

[2179.92 - 2183.7000000000003] and again we were part of eBay so we had

[2181.599 - 2186.7000000000003] to parse it out

[2183.7 - 2190.48] I don't know we've maybe had three 400

[2186.7 - 2193.2999999999997] people submit patent ideas you know um

[2190.48 - 2195.16] that were potentially patentable the

[2193.3 - 2197.1400000000003] first year I joined I think we did like

[2195.16 - 2199.839] three or four thousand so it was like

[2197.14 - 2201.7] literally 10xing that

[2199.839 - 2204.4] um and this was just trying to push this

[2201.7 - 2206.9199999999996] in the culture now was the quality of

[2204.4 - 2209.8] those ideas better than the year before

[2206.92 - 2212.44] an aggregate no I mean there's probably

[2209.8 - 2214.3] many more worse ideas in there but again

[2212.44 - 2215.859] that's not what mattered we wanted

[2214.3 - 2217.3590000000004] people just stepping up to the plate

[2215.859 - 2220.06] because you didn't know what kind of

[2217.359 - 2222.46] ridiculous idea might become something

[2220.06 - 2224.2] um you know I always joked one inventor

[2222.46 - 2226.359] who kept on putting ideas for like

[2224.2 - 2227.4399999999996] edible silverware and things like that

[2226.359 - 2230.859] like what does that have to do with

[2227.44 - 2233.92] PayPal or anything nothing but like was

[2230.859 - 2236.74] that a acceptable idea for us except yes

[2233.92 - 2239.14] yes because it's just going through the

[2236.74 - 2241.54] ideation process because we want like

[2239.14 - 2244.1189999999997] okay that doesn't here's some feedback

[2241.54 - 2247.48] on that now iterate improve get better

[2244.119 - 2250.0] in the process and so forth so you know

[2247.48 - 2251.5] so step one for Innovation be curious

[2250.0 - 2253.599] about the world learn about the world

[2251.5 - 2255.28] ask questions about the world step two

[2253.599 - 2257.38] is just come up with ideas and couple up

[2255.28 - 2258.82] with as many as possible and it doesn't

[2257.38 - 2260.7400000000002] mean you have to be submitting these

[2258.82 - 2262.7200000000003] ideas anywhere

[2260.74 - 2265.4199999999996] um you know there are some great sites

[2262.72 - 2267.22] like that like uh notepad.com

[2265.42 - 2269.32] um is a great one where you can just put

[2267.22 - 2271.8999999999996] like idealists and things like that I

[2269.32 - 2273.82] have used that for sure in the past

[2271.9 - 2276.88] um mostly I just put things into an

[2273.82 - 2279.339] Evernote actually a whole folder of

[2276.88 - 2281.079] Evernote files I have and I'm like these

[2279.339 - 2283.119] are book ideas these are business ideas

[2281.079 - 2284.8] these are movie ideas I don't even know

[2283.119 - 2287.02] what these ideas are but they're still

[2284.8 - 2289.48] ideas and those are kind of all the

[2287.02 - 2292.78] buckets I have and I just build that out

[2289.48 - 2295.18] and then when you're comfortably removed

[2292.78 - 2297.46] from those ideas kind of take a step

[2295.18 - 2300.64] back and reapproach them and see which

[2297.46 - 2303.64] ones resonate with you and most likely

[2300.64 - 2306.5789999999997] what is going to happen is that not any

[2303.64 - 2309.339] one idea is going to resonate but you're

[2306.579 - 2313.119] going to see value and connecting ideas

[2309.339 - 2316.18] that this movie idea that you had if you

[2313.119 - 2317.98] added it to this business idea holy cow

[2316.18 - 2320.68] that's really interesting what if you

[2317.98 - 2322.839] actually combine these we used to do a

[2320.68 - 2324.2799999999997] trick when when I had the Innovation Lab

[2322.839 - 2326.92] at PayPal where we would have people

[2324.28 - 2329.7400000000002] just write down ideas and topics throw

[2326.92 - 2331.66] it into a hats on little straps of paper

[2329.74 - 2333.4599999999996] and then people would just pull out two

[2331.66 - 2335.5] of them at a time and we're like okay

[2333.46 - 2337.0] given these two things what can we make

[2335.5 - 2339.339] out of it and we're gonna spend five

[2337.0 - 2340.9] minutes on this we're gonna brainstorm

[2339.339 - 2342.46] this and then we're gonna throw these

[2340.9 - 2344.04] away and somebody's gonna pick out two

[2342.46 - 2347.56] more random things

[2344.04 - 2350.859] and you know it's just an old technique

[2347.56 - 2353.56] to be able to apply

[2350.859 - 2355.7799999999997] um you know again so much of innovation

[2353.56 - 2357.339] is just taking two unrelated things and

[2355.78 - 2359.26] made into something related something

[2357.339 - 2361.18] powerful something that no one has ever

[2359.26 - 2364.0600000000004] thought of before and that's just one

[2361.18 - 2366.46] little hack to do that

[2364.06 - 2370.2999999999997] wonderful thanks so much for that deep

[2366.46 - 2372.82] dive into the the Innovative mindset

[2370.3 - 2375.1600000000003] um and so queuing off of that let's fast

[2372.82 - 2377.92] forward to today and uh of course we're

[2375.16 - 2380.44] in a hopefully a golden age of

[2377.92 - 2382.2400000000002] innovation with things like generative

[2380.44 - 2384.7000000000003] AI large language models that sort of

[2382.24 - 2386.4399999999996] stuff so what what do you see that's

[2384.7 - 2387.7599999999998] happening today what has caught your

[2386.44 - 2389.38] attention

[2387.76 - 2391.8390000000004] um in terms of Innovations and and what

[2389.38 - 2394.359] do you think it means uh in terms of

[2391.839 - 2396.46] technology or business or even the way

[2394.359 - 2398.38] that we live

[2396.46 - 2401.2] I I think the world is going to change

[2398.38 - 2402.88] more now than at any other point

[2401.2 - 2406.72] um in in my life

[2402.88 - 2408.2200000000003] uh I was fortunate enough to start the

[2406.72 - 2410.98] University of Illinois

[2408.22 - 2413.68] in 1995.

[2410.98 - 2416.38] um just as you know the the Netscape

[2413.68 - 2419.02] team was there like kind of building the

[2416.38 - 2420.7000000000003] browser and and so forth and like all

[2419.02 - 2422.38] the things that came from that like I

[2420.7 - 2425.2] had never used the internet in my life

[2422.38 - 2427.78] before I got to college I got there and

[2425.2 - 2429.8199999999997] and like literally my first day I'm like

[2427.78 - 2431.8] what the hell is this I don't understand

[2429.82 - 2434.26] this I don't even know what this is but

[2431.8 - 2436.78] this is amazing there's all these weird

[2434.26 - 2439.0600000000004] little like there's words and if I click

[2436.78 - 2440.619] on an underlying word it will take me

[2439.06 - 2443.0789999999997] somewhere else where I could learn more

[2440.619 - 2445.2400000000002] about that word or sometimes it takes I

[2443.079 - 2447.6400000000003] click and it's like like I'm like what

[2445.24 - 2451.7999999999997] is that that's a hyperlinkual like I had

[2447.64 - 2454.54] no knowledge of any of this stuff and

[2451.8 - 2456.579] joining like when I was at such a time

[2454.54 - 2459.52] where I was open to new learnings and

[2456.579 - 2461.5] memories like it was clear to me

[2459.52 - 2463.78] probably within a few weeks that this is

[2461.5 - 2464.44] going to change the world

[2463.78 - 2465.7000000000003] um

[2464.44 - 2469.7200000000003] and

[2465.7 - 2473.64] with what is happening today in Ai and

[2469.72 - 2477.0989999999997] generative AI like this is

[2473.64 - 2478.96] I feel is giddy now as I was when I was

[2477.099 - 2480.82] 18 years old

[2478.96 - 2483.66] um and learning about these things and

[2480.82 - 2486.46] just seeing what is possible

[2483.66 - 2488.92] let me Dave if I can let me let me just

[2486.46 - 2490.54] give my first experience I ever had with

[2488.92 - 2493.54] gpt3

[2490.54 - 2497.74] um so one of the things I've done is uh

[2493.54 - 2502.06] last year yeah so I've been 2000 and uh

[2497.74 - 2505.66] sorry about uh 2021

[2502.06 - 2507.82] I once back and started to get an MFA in

[2505.66 - 2509.0789999999997] writing always been passionate about

[2507.82 - 2511.599] writing

[2509.079 - 2513.46] um I read like 50 books a year I you

[2511.599 - 2515.1400000000003] know I'm I'm oh and I'm always like yeah

[2513.46 - 2517.9] I could do that but like when I grew up

[2515.14 - 2520.06] I was more of a science and math kid and

[2517.9 - 2521.38] English was kind of de-emphasize and I

[2520.06 - 2523.48] was kind of always like afraid of that

[2521.38 - 2525.52] and all everything but I'm like you know

[2523.48 - 2526.9] what I'm I'm gonna do this I I want to

[2525.52 - 2529.66] really learn how to become a great

[2526.9 - 2531.7000000000003] writer when I was there it was pretty

[2529.66 - 2534.64] clear to me like where I had a

[2531.7 - 2536.98] competitive Advantage was combining like

[2534.64 - 2539.02] my technical background and know-how

[2536.98 - 2541.0] with this writing skill that I'm

[2539.02 - 2542.859] building and I very quickly became

[2541.0 - 2545.74] focused on

[2542.859 - 2550.66] um well how can I use AI to do that

[2545.74 - 2552.7599999999998] so I used gpt3 for the first time on a

[2550.66 - 2554.0789999999997] writing project which I fully disclosed

[2552.76 - 2556.6600000000003] and we and I'd love to get into

[2554.079 - 2559.119] disclosures and things like that

[2556.66 - 2562.42] but for for the very first class I was

[2559.119 - 2564.94] taking I was writing a a little

[2562.42 - 2567.28] um almost kind of like a an audio drama

[2564.94 - 2569.859] sketch comedy type thing with all these

[2567.28 - 2572.5600000000004] little skits all about the presidents

[2569.859 - 2574.96] I'm a total nerd like yes I was writing

[2572.56 - 2576.5789999999997] audio sketch comedy about the presidents

[2574.96 - 2577.48] and had all these little sketches and so

[2576.579 - 2579.28] forth

[2577.48 - 2581.26] and one of them I wanted to write was

[2579.28 - 2583.0] about the president of the future

[2581.26 - 2584.8590000000004] and it kind of dawned on me I'm like oh

[2583.0 - 2587.14] what better way to do president of the

[2584.859 - 2590.7999999999997] future than to actually have an AI right

[2587.14 - 2593.2] part of that so I remember I took in and

[2590.8 - 2595.96] and I disclosed every single bit of what

[2593.2 - 2598.839] I did in my writing I took the first two

[2595.96 - 2600.359] lines from Obama's second inaugural

[2598.839 - 2603.5789999999997] address

[2600.359 - 2605.5] and I think I added maybe three lines of

[2603.579 - 2608.619] my own so it's kind of five minutes or

[2605.5 - 2610.42] sorry five sentences of material to

[2608.619 - 2613.2400000000002] start and

[2610.42 - 2616.599] um and I kind of hit just hit go and

[2613.24 - 2618.4599999999996] just to see what would happen and I

[2616.599 - 2622.48] remember just being amazed I'm like oh

[2618.46 - 2624.64] my God it's recognizing that this is a

[2622.48 - 2627.52] presidential speech it is kind of

[2624.64 - 2629.74] carrying on the same Cadence it is like

[2627.52 - 2631.3] recognizing that it is a computer that

[2629.74 - 2634.0] is writing this at some point in the

[2631.3 - 2635.7400000000002] future like it is carrying this on and

[2634.0 - 2637.599] it was doing it in ways that I never

[2635.74 - 2639.52] would have imagined and I remember like

[2637.599 - 2641.1400000000003] going through this exercise and so many

[2639.52 - 2643.839] times like my wife was working upstairs

[2641.14 - 2645.22] I think the kids were in bed already

[2643.839 - 2647.14] um I'm just running upstairs I'm like

[2645.22 - 2651.2799999999997] like look at this look at this I didn't

[2647.14 - 2653.6189999999997] write this I did I was so excited so I

[2651.28 - 2656.6800000000003] was just enamored by what was coming out

[2653.619 - 2658.2400000000002] of this thing and I kept doing it and

[2656.68 - 2660.22] you know and it actually it was a little

[2658.24 - 2662.2599999999998] bit glitchy too but I'm like well this

[2660.22 - 2663.7599999999998] is perfect like that's an angle that I

[2662.26 - 2666.46] never even thought of like what if

[2663.76 - 2669.88] giving the inaugural this you know AI

[2666.46 - 2672.04] computer president is glitchy and so I

[2669.88 - 2675.04] did this whole speech and then use some

[2672.04 - 2677.859] text to voice type program to do that

[2675.04 - 2681.88] and like boom like I made that and that

[2677.859 - 2684.22] was my first time using uh gbt3 and it

[2681.88 - 2686.6800000000003] was incredible and so after that I've

[2684.22 - 2688.8999999999996] I've just been like that to me is the

[2686.68 - 2691.5989999999997] same moments where I clicked on a link

[2688.9 - 2693.7000000000003] on my first day of college and it took

[2691.599 - 2695.92] me somewhere else like it was just

[2693.7 - 2697.74] completely my mind was blown and I'm

[2695.92 - 2700.48] like this is going to change everything

[2697.74 - 2703.66] fast forward a year plus to where we're

[2700.48 - 2705.099] at today like good god with like the

[2703.66 - 2707.319] things that we could do with chat GPT

[2705.099 - 2710.02] like I was literally just talking to my

[2707.319 - 2712.96] kid in the car this morning my kid does

[2710.02 - 2715.359] a podcast on a game called brawl Stars

[2712.96 - 2717.819] he's 11. he does this I'm like why don't

[2715.359 - 2721.5989999999997] you interview chat gbt for your podcast

[2717.819 - 2724.359] about brawl stars and he's like you can

[2721.599 - 2725.92] do that I'm like sure like do that we

[2724.359 - 2727.2999999999997] could do we could do this together and

[2725.92 - 2729.579] like like you could have this whole

[2727.3 - 2731.5600000000004] interview I'm sure just putting chat gbt

[2729.579 - 2733.1800000000003] in the in the title of your podcast

[2731.56 - 2736.359] going to get you a bunch more clicks and

[2733.18 - 2738.64] everything and like wow um and so that's

[2736.359 - 2740.68] going to be his project this afternoon

[2738.64 - 2742.359] there's just so much that can be done

[2740.68 - 2745.24] here

[2742.359 - 2746.859] um and we're just just scratching the

[2745.24 - 2749.2] surface of this so like that's why like

[2746.859 - 2752.319] this is going I I truly truly believe

[2749.2 - 2755.319] what we're going to see with AI

[2752.319 - 2759.4] um and generative consumer friendly AI

[2755.319 - 2762.2799999999997] is going to be more transformative I

[2759.4 - 2765.64] believe than the internet itself was

[2762.28 - 2767.92] absolutely yeah I I believe that I feel

[2765.64 - 2771.7] that and you know just hearing you know

[2767.92 - 2774.76] your perspective first time using uh uh

[2771.7 - 2777.0989999999997] uh web browsers seeing the internet and

[2774.76 - 2779.26] you know it's 1995 so fast forward more

[2777.099 - 2781.96] than 20 years like imagine where we'll

[2779.26 - 2784.7200000000003] be in 20 years so I have a few follow-up

[2781.96 - 2787.42] questions regarding obviously no one can

[2784.72 - 2788.4399999999996] predict the future like you know uh one

[2787.42 - 2790.3] of the stories that you told me about

[2788.44 - 2792.4] PayPal was uh the first time someone

[2790.3 - 2794.1400000000003] bought a well I think a car with PayPal

[2792.4 - 2795.579] mobile like you couldn't have predicted

[2794.14 - 2798.339] that from the invention of the iPhone

[2795.579 - 2799.8390000000004] right but then in hindsight it is kind

[2798.339 - 2801.2799999999997] of obvious

[2799.839 - 2803.5] um so could you tell us a little bit

[2801.28 - 2805.8390000000004] about that story in terms of yeah like

[2803.5 - 2808.48] what what you know combining new ideas

[2805.839 - 2810.4] and and innovating and what can you

[2808.48 - 2812.319] predict what can't you predict and what

[2810.4 - 2813.52] do you see what what are like the I

[2812.319 - 2814.96] guess what's the low hanging fruit with

[2813.52 - 2817.3] generative AI how do you think it's

[2814.96 - 2818.619] going to change first and and in an

[2817.3 - 2820.1800000000003] optimistic future what's going to be

[2818.619 - 2821.98] what's going to be the the the the the

[2820.18 - 2824.9199999999996] good timeline

[2821.98 - 2827.2] of uh of progress yeah yeah then we get

[2824.92 - 2827.859] into the evil timeline uh late later as

[2827.2 - 2830.9399999999996] well

[2827.859 - 2834.16] um so to tell this story I I remember

[2830.94 - 2836.5] back when I joined in 2011 uh mobile was

[2834.16 - 2838.5989999999997] still kind of weird it was it was still

[2836.5 - 2840.88] a fringe thing it was its own unit

[2838.599 - 2842.8590000000004] within PayPal

[2840.88 - 2844.6600000000003] um you know that it was a very very

[2842.859 - 2846.5789999999997] small part of the business and so forth

[2844.66 - 2849.8799999999997] and again we were owned by eBay at the

[2846.579 - 2852.099] time so eBay had a similar mobile team

[2849.88 - 2854.1400000000003] um but eBay had a whole bunch of other

[2852.099 - 2856.599] like kind of mobile focused one-off

[2854.14 - 2860.5] businesses one was called red laser

[2856.599 - 2861.4] which sole purpose was for scanning QR

[2860.5 - 2864.28] codes

[2861.4 - 2865.96] like so before like back in 2011 your

[2864.28 - 2867.76] phone if you held up the camera would

[2865.96 - 2869.98] not recognize a QR code you actually had

[2867.76 - 2871.3590000000004] to have a QR code reader and red laser

[2869.98 - 2872.7400000000002] was one of them

[2871.359 - 2875.14] um and and there are a bunch of other

[2872.74 - 2878.2] like little businesses within eBay and

[2875.14 - 2879.339] you know to the team's credit like we I

[2878.2 - 2882.9399999999996] remember

[2879.339 - 2885.64] you know not long after being there we

[2882.94 - 2887.7400000000002] all would kind of meet and just talk

[2885.64 - 2889.2999999999997] like all these businesses would just all

[2887.74 - 2890.3799999999997] meet together in a bid Commerce room and

[2889.3 - 2893.319] just like hey what are you seeing what

[2890.38 - 2896.26] are you finding and it was actually eBay

[2893.319 - 2899.02] I was on the eBay side of things

[2896.26 - 2899.8] um they were like we sold a car on

[2899.02 - 2901.839] mobile

[2899.8 - 2903.88] it was like one of those things like

[2901.839 - 2907.48] really like somebody just bought a car

[2903.88 - 2910.319] on a phone like you can do that like

[2907.48 - 2913.3] like I mean even to us it seemed kind of

[2910.319 - 2916.3] Novel but also a little bit of a

[2913.3 - 2918.7000000000003] Harbinger for like things are changing

[2916.3 - 2921.76] somebody just bought a car on this like

[2918.7 - 2923.319] that's a pretty big deal for where we

[2921.76 - 2925.6600000000003] might be going if somebody's willing to

[2923.319 - 2928.0] make that type of a purchase on this

[2925.66 - 2930.16] device what does that say is this just a

[2928.0 - 2933.22] one-off fringe is this somebody you know

[2930.16 - 2934.66] using their Bitcoin to buy a pizza and

[2933.22 - 2936.5789999999997] like well nobody's really going to

[2934.66 - 2938.56] replicate that anytime soon or was this

[2936.579 - 2941.38] something new and something special

[2938.56 - 2943.54] and you know those are the kind of

[2941.38 - 2945.339] things where you just start to see the

[2943.54 - 2948.22] trend you start to see the volume you

[2945.339 - 2950.2599999999998] start to see the change in behaviors and

[2948.22 - 2952.5989999999997] you know you're on to something and soon

[2950.26 - 2955.1800000000003] enough you know mobile is not a weird

[2952.599 - 2958.0] Standalone unit mobile is now the cool

[2955.18 - 2959.859] team to kind of be in in the company and

[2958.0 - 2962.02] then eventually mobile is not even a

[2959.859 - 2964.0] team anymore in the company it's just

[2962.02 - 2967.359] everything needs to be made mobile first

[2964.0 - 2970.119] you know much credit to uh to meta and

[2967.359 - 2971.14] Facebook you know Mark Zuckerberg when

[2970.119 - 2974.56] he was

[2971.14 - 2976.24] you know working on his S1 and and his

[2974.56 - 2979.7799999999997] executive letter at the beginning of the

[2976.24 - 2981.7] S1 when Facebook was going public

[2979.78 - 2983.6800000000003] Facebook everyone was like Facebook is

[2981.7 - 2985.48] going to get killed by mobile like we're

[2983.68 - 2987.04] moving in this mobile Direction but

[2985.48 - 2989.26] Facebook's gonna get killed how are you

[2987.04 - 2991.24] going to serve ads on mobile this real

[2989.26 - 2992.92] estate is not big enough it's just not

[2991.24 - 2994.1189999999997] going to make sense it's not going to

[2992.92 - 2996.46] work

[2994.119 - 2998.26] um he pivoted that entire company I mean

[2996.46 - 3000.839] because this was like this was the

[2998.26 - 3002.579] standard consensus that like hey like

[3000.839 - 3004.38] mobile doesn't work for advertising

[3002.579 - 3006.7400000000002] Facebook when people move to mobile you

[3004.38 - 3008.819] debt and

[3006.74 - 3011.16] Zuckerberg said okay I'm going to write

[3008.819 - 3012.9] this whole thing on mobile I'm moving

[3011.16 - 3015.48] everyone to mobile like you know they

[3012.9 - 3017.52] had some you know HTML5 they had some

[3015.48 - 3019.5] hiccups and so forth as you will when

[3017.52 - 3020.64] you're doing a major pivot

[3019.5 - 3022.079] um but he moved them in the right

[3020.64 - 3024.0] direction now I think he's trying to

[3022.079 - 3025.619] move them again with with meta and the

[3024.0 - 3027.18] metaverse clearly whether or not that's

[3025.619 - 3029.099] the right direction I guess we'll be

[3027.18 - 3031.14] seen I think there's still a lot of

[3029.099 - 3032.94] skepticism but like I guarantee you he's

[3031.14 - 3035.46] thinking back to 10 years ago I was

[3032.94 - 3037.619] right like and he clearly was 10 years

[3035.46 - 3039.9] ago so like this is the file he has in

[3037.619 - 3041.4] his head and so because he was right 10

[3039.9 - 3043.92] years ago probably makes it even harder

[3041.4 - 3046.319] to prove him that he might be wrong uh

[3043.92 - 3047.94] and whether or not the metaverse may or

[3046.319 - 3049.68] may not be the right decision for

[3047.94 - 3052.92] Facebook so

[3049.68 - 3055.0789999999997] yeah yeah no you absolutely right and

[3052.92 - 3057.42] obviously Facebook or meta's stock

[3055.079 - 3059.46] prices reflecting a tremendous amount of

[3057.42 - 3060.66] let's say investor skepticism right yeah

[3059.46 - 3062.339] yeah

[3060.66 - 3064.74] um but you know so there's those pivotal

[3062.339 - 3067.2599999999998] moments right where where the industry

[3064.74 - 3069.8999999999996] insiders sense that things have changed

[3067.26 - 3071.7000000000003] and uh and you mentioned Chad GPT and

[3069.9 - 3074.4] even you know your 11 year old was like

[3071.7 - 3077.04] wait you can do that and uh you know it

[3074.4 - 3078.54] I I had that moment with chat GPT where

[3077.04 - 3080.819] I was like this is just another chatbot

[3078.54 - 3082.619] and then I saw that it passed a practice

[3080.819 - 3085.5589999999997] bar exam

[3082.619 - 3087.0] um someone used it uh do all kinds of

[3085.559 - 3089.6400000000003] stuff like I don't I don't know if

[3087.0 - 3091.38] anyone's like diagnosed um uh medical

[3089.64 - 3092.7] cases yet but people have used it for

[3091.38 - 3096.059] all kinds of things that you wouldn't

[3092.7 - 3097.02] think are uh are are possible yet but

[3096.059 - 3099.599] then

[3097.02 - 3100.98] um I use it to build a not a web app yet

[3099.599 - 3102.78] that's one of one of my next projects

[3100.98 - 3104.64] but it's like this thing is a force

[3102.78 - 3107.1600000000003] multiplier for any coder let alone

[3104.64 - 3108.839] whatever else is out there that it you

[3107.16 - 3111.0589999999997] know either in version one that it can

[3108.839 - 3112.68] do or subsequent versions so I think

[3111.059 - 3115.5] this is one of those like pivotal

[3112.68 - 3118.2] moments like you know it's as big as

[3115.5 - 3120.359] switching from you know browser-based

[3118.2 - 3122.9399999999996] you know computer PC based to mobile

[3120.359 - 3126.72] based but it's you know the underlying

[3122.94 - 3128.76] capacity of AI is is I'm not going to

[3126.72 - 3130.9199999999996] say bigger or it's not bigger or less

[3128.76 - 3133.26] than internet but it's different right

[3130.92 - 3135.2400000000002] it's very different and so let's talk

[3133.26 - 3137.0400000000004] about like let's let's talk about the

[3135.24 - 3138.66] good timeline versus the bad timeline

[3137.04 - 3140.94] because there's there like what are you

[3138.66 - 3142.2] what are you personally worried about

[3140.94 - 3144.48] um in in terms of what you're seeing

[3142.2 - 3146.22] right now well let's just talk about

[3144.48 - 3147.66] timeline first and then we'll get in the

[3146.22 - 3150.0589999999997] good and bad and I want to give a real

[3147.66 - 3151.44] specific example David so

[3150.059 - 3155.2200000000003] um in a class that I'm taking right now

[3151.44 - 3157.2000000000003] for my MFA um like for this semester uh

[3155.22 - 3159.24] I was like okay I'm gonna write a longer

[3157.2 - 3159.96] piece on

[3159.24 - 3162.72] um

[3159.96 - 3166.559] AIS in the classroom and so when I

[3162.72 - 3167.819] started this piece in August let's say

[3166.559 - 3169.8] um you know I started to build this up

[3167.819 - 3171.96] and and I actually went to schools I

[3169.8 - 3173.88] talked to teachers like none of them had

[3171.96 - 3175.38] really like like honestly none of them

[3173.88 - 3178.6800000000003] had heard of this even like the school

[3175.38 - 3180.78] my kids go to I live in Silicon Valley

[3178.68 - 3182.2799999999997] um it's a bunch of like Tech execs at

[3180.78 - 3184.02] the school and I actually went to the

[3182.28 - 3185.099] high school and was talking to a bunch

[3184.02 - 3187.559] of kids

[3185.099 - 3189.1800000000003] and this would have been November about

[3187.559 - 3192.059] gpt3

[3189.18 - 3194.819] maybe 20 30 of them had ever even heard

[3192.059 - 3197.1600000000003] of gpt3 or or the concept I mean like

[3194.819 - 3199.38] they and like only one even admitted to

[3197.16 - 3200.2799999999997] using it like and I truly believe the

[3199.38 - 3201.42] others are like what are you talking

[3200.28 - 3203.28] about I don't know what you're talking

[3201.42 - 3205.8] about old man like

[3203.28 - 3207.6600000000003] um they didn't know and so as I'm

[3205.8 - 3209.7000000000003] working on this paper like it's supposed

[3207.66 - 3211.859] to be like a 2500 word piece you know

[3209.7 - 3212.9399999999996] longer interviews all this other kind of

[3211.859 - 3215.339] stuff

[3212.94 - 3217.619] um as I'm about to hand the getting

[3215.339 - 3218.7799999999997] close to handing this in chat gbt

[3217.619 - 3223.079] releases

[3218.78 - 3226.38] and like within a week like everything

[3223.079 - 3228.42] changed like like the timeline that I

[3226.38 - 3231.48] was thinking back in August September

[3228.42 - 3233.52] for how long this is going to be even I

[3231.48 - 3235.44] had some there was a couple art there

[3233.52 - 3238.819] weren't many but a few articles that I

[3235.44 - 3242.04] was able to find written earlier in 2022

[3238.819 - 3243.359] about AI in the classroom they're like

[3242.04 - 3245.16] yeah this is going to start to change

[3243.359 - 3247.5589999999997] things just wait a few years from now

[3245.16 - 3250.319] this is changing everything

[3247.559 - 3252.7200000000003] um within like a week it started to

[3250.319 - 3254.579] become really clear that like oh this

[3252.72 - 3257.339] isn't a weak thing

[3254.579 - 3260.88] um you know I think Sam Altman who's the

[3257.339 - 3264.18] the CEO of openai had had tweeted

[3260.88 - 3267.2400000000002] they've reached a million users of chat

[3264.18 - 3270.2999999999997] GPT within five days

[3267.24 - 3271.859] pretty crazy now not coming here true

[3270.3 - 3273.3590000000004] it's a free product how many of them are

[3271.859 - 3274.7999999999997] true reduces you can argue all these

[3273.359 - 3277.92] things but still there was a million

[3274.8 - 3280.98] different accounts on open AI that had

[3277.92 - 3283.7400000000002] used this product in a very very short

[3280.98 - 3285.48] amount of time like that's astronomical

[3283.74 - 3288.24] and so

[3285.48 - 3291.66] to your point just like about timelines

[3288.24 - 3294.1189999999997] in general like it's really hard to even

[3291.66 - 3296.64] just predict like what the timelines are

[3294.119 - 3299.46] going to be because truly what I thought

[3296.64 - 3303.72] the timeline was going to be five months

[3299.46 - 3306.78] ago is nowhere near what it seems to be

[3303.72 - 3308.8799999999997] today and like is it just it because

[3306.78 - 3311.6400000000003] this is hard it's just hard for humans

[3308.88 - 3314.099] to imagine exponential growth I remember

[3311.64 - 3316.2599999999998] having I remember taking sorry I'm in a

[3314.099 - 3318.3] total sidebar here but I remember at the

[3316.26 - 3321.119] beginning of pandemic this was like

[3318.3 - 3322.7400000000002] February March no no it was March the

[3321.119 - 3325.2000000000003] kids were already out of school like

[3322.74 - 3326.52] we're doing homeschooling of them and

[3325.2 - 3327.96] I'm like I don't even know what to do

[3326.52 - 3329.64] with my kids at that point because like

[3327.96 - 3331.7400000000002] the teachers weren't really giving stuff

[3329.64 - 3332.7] I got to keep them busy somehow and I

[3331.74 - 3334.6189999999997] was like let's let's understand

[3332.7 - 3336.72] exponential growth now remember we got

[3334.619 - 3339.7200000000003] out all like we have like hundreds of

[3336.72 - 3341.2799999999997] Lego Minifigures and we started to lay

[3339.72 - 3343.5589999999997] them out and to try and explain

[3341.28 - 3345.78] exponential growth because part of this

[3343.559 - 3348.3] was also for the pandemic pandemic but I

[3345.78 - 3350.7000000000003] was explaining like um are not and like

[3348.3 - 3353.7000000000003] you know like the growth trajectory of a

[3350.7 - 3357.4199999999996] virus and so forth and

[3353.7 - 3359.64] it was really hard to grasp that and so

[3357.42 - 3361.8] using Legos as a visual representation

[3359.64 - 3363.0589999999997] of like hey this is what like linear

[3361.8 - 3365.52] growth looks like this is what

[3363.059 - 3368.7000000000003] exponential growth looks like it's

[3365.52 - 3371.22] shocking and just like how after like

[3368.7 - 3372.8999999999996] you know a few days of doubling or

[3371.22 - 3375.2999999999997] tripling or whatever it might be what

[3372.9 - 3377.339] that means that's the path that we're

[3375.3 - 3380.3390000000004] going down here

[3377.339 - 3383.22] um and even for people who are in it are

[3380.339 - 3385.68] aware of this you know shortcoming of us

[3383.22 - 3387.4199999999996] uh psychologically of just like how hard

[3385.68 - 3389.52] it is for us to grasp these things

[3387.42 - 3390.96] because like in our caveman days we

[3389.52 - 3393.72] never really had to deal with much

[3390.96 - 3396.599] exponential growth uh in any ways like

[3393.72 - 3398.8799999999997] this is just something for all of us

[3396.599 - 3400.5] like it's gonna be really hard to even

[3398.88 - 3402.839] understand the timeline

[3400.5 - 3405.9] so now to your question though so it's

[3402.839 - 3408.66] all right that's on the timeline to get

[3405.9 - 3410.28] to you know what's the good path versus

[3408.66 - 3414.66] the bad path

[3410.28 - 3417.7200000000003] look I I think I hope

[3414.66 - 3419.819] um that this is going to be a tool that

[3417.72 - 3422.16] is just going to enable more creativity

[3419.819 - 3425.099] that is going to be able to level the

[3422.16 - 3426.5989999999997] playing field so that

[3425.099 - 3428.52] um you don't have to have a writing

[3426.599 - 3429.9] partner you don't necessarily have to

[3428.52 - 3432.24] have

[3429.9 - 3434.819] um you know or have the resources to pay

[3432.24 - 3437.2799999999997] money for an editor you you don't have

[3434.819 - 3439.079] to you know translation has already kind

[3437.28 - 3440.88] of Gone Away in many ways but like let's

[3439.079 - 3442.8590000000004] just say translation or something like

[3440.88 - 3445.02] that if you want you know you want to

[3442.859 - 3447.18] read something that's in another Market

[3445.02 - 3449.52] or something or not written in your own

[3447.18 - 3450.8999999999996] native tongue like like all of these

[3449.52 - 3454.319] things

[3450.9 - 3455.94] I truly hope we'll be leveling

[3454.319 - 3456.9] um you know we'll level the playing

[3455.94 - 3460.2000000000003] field

[3456.9 - 3462.599] but that said like there are jobs that

[3460.2 - 3464.2799999999997] are going to go away there are jobs that

[3462.599 - 3465.7200000000003] are going to change

[3464.28 - 3468.599] um I don't know what that is going to

[3465.72 - 3470.0989999999997] look like the consensus three years ago

[3468.599 - 3472.38] was that like yeah if you got a blue

[3470.099 - 3474.3] collar job right now you're you're not

[3472.38 - 3478.099] in a good place

[3474.3 - 3480.6600000000003] um but where we seem to be today is that

[3478.099 - 3484.079] it's more the knowledge workers are

[3480.66 - 3486.2999999999997] going to be replaced by Ada AI

[3484.079 - 3488.88] um it's the creative types it's the

[3486.3 - 3490.38] designers it's the artists it's the

[3488.88 - 3491.4] writers

[3490.38 - 3495.059] um

[3491.4 - 3498.2400000000002] and look I I think when we start to go

[3495.059 - 3500.099] down this path like I don't

[3498.24 - 3502.2] I don't know how we're going to avoid

[3500.099 - 3506.7000000000003] that on a macro level

[3502.2 - 3508.8799999999997] on a micro level I think the people who

[3506.7 - 3511.68] are truly able to

[3508.88 - 3515.099] embrace the technology

[3511.68 - 3517.6189999999997] to accept it and to find a way for

[3515.099 - 3519.2400000000002] themselves to be more creative by using

[3517.619 - 3522.7200000000003] it that's where you're going to get

[3519.24 - 3525.299] about the value like look I I think

[3522.72 - 3526.98] if if you're a writer you know what are

[3525.299 - 3529.2599999999998] the things that writers hate writers

[3526.98 - 3532.02] hate marketing writers writers like to

[3529.26 - 3535.1400000000003] write right you know writers hate doing

[3532.02 - 3537.299] the the synopsis for my book the summary

[3535.14 - 3539.22] for for Amazon like like I I know

[3537.299 - 3541.38] writers and like it can sometimes take

[3539.22 - 3543.72] more time doing that than it can like

[3541.38 - 3545.28] writing like five chapters and in the

[3543.72 - 3547.74] book because it's like oh God I gotta do

[3545.28 - 3549.96] this like it's so painful like that

[3547.74 - 3551.7599999999998] stuff where the AI can really really

[3549.96 - 3554.52] help

[3551.76 - 3558.119] um and so if you can be a kind of person

[3554.52 - 3560.099] who can Embrace that for you know the

[3558.119 - 3563.04] not let's just say the non-value-added

[3560.099 - 3564.299] stuff or you know to frankly never have

[3563.04 - 3566.339] writer's block

[3564.299 - 3567.48] to just be in front of a page and say

[3566.339 - 3569.22] hey can you give me three different

[3567.48 - 3572.4] directions that I can go with this story

[3569.22 - 3575.0989999999997] I'm stuck here or this character Arc is

[3572.4 - 3577.2000000000003] giving me trouble like and to use that

[3575.099 - 3579.48] like I think that that's going to be

[3577.2 - 3581.7599999999998] really powerful again it's going to be

[3579.48 - 3583.14] like having the advantage of having a

[3581.76 - 3584.5200000000004] writing partner

[3583.14 - 3587.54] um which is not something we all have

[3584.52 - 3587.54] the advantage of having

[3588.24 - 3594.24] yeah no I I just want to pause and and

[3591.48 - 3595.5] give some appreciation to the gravity of

[3594.24 - 3598.2] some of what you're bringing up here

[3595.5 - 3600.359] because you know recently there's been a

[3598.2 - 3603.299] huge backlash against AI generated art

[3600.359 - 3606.24] and uh there's even Simone uh so I had

[3603.299 - 3608.52] some mild uh controversy of my own

[3606.24 - 3609.8999999999996] because I took down some of the tools

[3608.52 - 3611.7] that I was making

[3609.9 - 3614.099] um that would write novels or parts of

[3611.7 - 3615.72] novels automatically and I took it down

[3614.099 - 3618.119] a few months ago because I was like hold

[3615.72 - 3619.98] on you know most of my friends are

[3618.119 - 3620.88] writers and you know my fiance is a

[3619.98 - 3622.619] writer and I was like I don't want to

[3620.88 - 3624.1800000000003] hurt the people that I care about and

[3622.619 - 3625.76] and like you said though part of the

[3624.18 - 3628.3799999999997] problem is

[3625.76 - 3630.119] disruption at this point is inevitable

[3628.38 - 3632.28] like we can't put this Genie back in the

[3630.119 - 3634.02] bottle so what do we do and and like you

[3632.28 - 3636.1800000000003] said there we don't know enough right

[3634.02 - 3637.68] now we don't have good answers uh

[3636.18 - 3639.1189999999997] certainly not on the macro level so that

[3637.68 - 3640.319] is that is definitely something to be

[3639.119 - 3642.359] worried about

[3640.319 - 3645.24] um and then also the scale of disruption

[3642.359 - 3646.859] right like you know our imagination we

[3645.24 - 3649.6189999999997] can't imagine what it's going to be like

[3646.859 - 3651.42] if you know employment numbers change

[3649.619 - 3653.52] and of course you know historically

[3651.42 - 3655.079] there's one there's one Ray of Hope here

[3653.52 - 3658.02] is historically new technologies

[3655.079 - 3660.6600000000003] ultimately result in more jobs right

[3658.02 - 3661.98] where you know labor gets easier people

[3660.66 - 3663.48] are more productive there's more money

[3661.98 - 3665.94] to go around there's more money to spend

[3663.48 - 3667.38] which means demand for other services

[3665.94 - 3669.78] but you know of course there's the

[3667.38 - 3671.6400000000003] possibility that like it might not pan

[3669.78 - 3673.92] out that way especially if the machine

[3671.64 - 3675.5989999999997] is cheaper than the human labor and you

[3673.92 - 3678.7200000000003] just take it away from people and then

[3675.599 - 3680.04] who owns the machines right and then you

[3678.72 - 3682.3799999999997] know of course this is this is like the

[3680.04 - 3684.359] dark timeline speculation

[3682.38 - 3686.52] um and so do you have any any reactions

[3684.359 - 3688.5] to that or any comments or thoughts on

[3686.52 - 3690.96] like you know ownership or

[3688.5 - 3693.72] responsibility for some of this stuff

[3690.96 - 3695.76] yeah the thing that I'm that I do

[3693.72 - 3698.8799999999997] struggle most about is is really like

[3695.76 - 3702.8390000000004] the training models and like I that is

[3698.88 - 3706.2000000000003] where I'm because as humans we learn by

[3702.839 - 3707.7599999999998] mimicry I mean as anybody who's has a

[3706.2 - 3709.799] little kid or has had a little kid or

[3707.76 - 3711.42] been around little kids know that's that

[3709.799 - 3713.46] is just how we learn as humans and we

[3711.42 - 3715.44] carry this throughout our lives

[3713.46 - 3718.98] um we learn by mimicking we learn by

[3715.44 - 3722.099] mimicking if you know anybody who

[3718.98 - 3724.2] um has written as a teenager I'm sure if

[3722.099 - 3725.7000000000003] you still have yourself as a teenager go

[3724.2 - 3726.72] back and read what you wrote and it'll

[3725.7 - 3729.1189999999997] probably make you want to throw up

[3726.72 - 3732.48] because you're like oh this is just me

[3729.119 - 3734.52] mimicking uh Isaac Asimov or or whatever

[3732.48 - 3736.079] it is like that you were reading at the

[3734.52 - 3738.42] time was was doing that I remember

[3736.079 - 3740.819] writing something once as a kid I was

[3738.42 - 3743.64] like oh my God I just like and then like

[3740.819 - 3746.7] after I wrote it realized like I'm just

[3743.64 - 3748.92] rewriting Watchmen like it's just it

[3746.7 - 3750.839] didn't Dawning me though I'm like this

[3748.92 - 3753.059] is just ripping off Alan Moore like what

[3750.839 - 3754.2599999999998] am I even doing here

[3753.059 - 3757.02] um and that's probably how I got away

[3754.26 - 3760.8590000000004] from writing in in my youth

[3757.02 - 3764.22] um so look as humans we have always done

[3760.859 - 3766.74] this but like to have an AI model that

[3764.22 - 3770.0989999999997] is being trained on and let's just stick

[3766.74 - 3773.3999999999996] with art for a second on artists who may

[3770.099 - 3777.2400000000002] not have explicitly who have not mind

[3773.4 - 3778.92] you explicitly given permission to use

[3777.24 - 3782.4599999999996] their artwork

[3778.92 - 3785.94] I think that that you know are they

[3782.46 - 3789.119] open to some sort of compensation

[3785.94 - 3790.799] um are they open to saying you can't use

[3789.119 - 3792.2400000000002] this like

[3790.799 - 3796.2] I don't know how you say you can't

[3792.24 - 3798.359] because here's the thing like even if um

[3796.2 - 3801.0589999999997] okay I'm going with my comic Roots here

[3798.359 - 3801.859] so so there was a very

[3801.059 - 3805.38] um

[3801.859 - 3807.9] so very popular artists in the 1990s guy

[3805.38 - 3810.0] was named Rob liefeld who in many ways

[3807.9 - 3811.859] is now a punching bag for like the style

[3810.0 - 3817.4] that he created was kind of the epitome

[3811.859 - 3820.38] of 90s male machismo comic art style and

[3817.4 - 3824.2200000000003] but the style that he created got

[3820.38 - 3826.98] mimicked by so many others so even if

[3824.22 - 3828.299] Rob liefeld today's uh you know because

[3826.98 - 3829.92] I could and I've done this I've

[3828.299 - 3831.72] literally won into something and said

[3829.92 - 3833.28] hey do something in the style of Life

[3831.72 - 3834.66] held I'm like Ah that's it I could

[3833.28 - 3836.46] totally recognize this style and

[3834.66 - 3838.74] everything even if he said do you want

[3836.46 - 3840.599] you can't use my style

[3838.74 - 3843.1189999999997] um there's so many people that came

[3840.599 - 3845.579] after him that were mimicking his style

[3843.119 - 3846.96] that we never once said like hey even

[3845.579 - 3849.6600000000003] though you're making your own original

[3846.96 - 3852.18] work you can't mimic that

[3849.66 - 3854.46] you know that then creates a whole thing

[3852.18 - 3856.44] well then do we what if they want to be

[3854.46 - 3860.28] included in there what if they want to

[3856.44 - 3863.28] like be you know have opted in but their

[3860.28 - 3864.6600000000003] their own style is in some way an homage

[3863.28 - 3866.8190000000004] or mimicking or however you want to

[3864.66 - 3869.339] think of it of that like what do we do

[3866.819 - 3871.319] in those situations like

[3869.339 - 3873.0] this is something I mean so honestly

[3871.319 - 3876.0589999999997] this is something where I'm really

[3873.0 - 3877.859] sympathetic to both sides here like I I

[3876.059 - 3880.079] totally see both sides I don't know what

[3877.859 - 3882.96] the answer is and this is a really

[3880.079 - 3885.3590000000004] complicated question that our legal

[3882.96 - 3888.96] system as it exists today with copyright

[3885.359 - 3891.9] is nowhere near having a clear Solution

[3888.96 - 3893.28] on and frankly at least in the U.S the

[3891.9 - 3896.339] sooner we get down that path the better

[3893.28 - 3901.02] but here's the reality is like

[3896.339 - 3901.74] just one of 195 countries in the world

[3901.02 - 3905.04] um

[3901.74 - 3911.0989999999997] copyright law is very different wherever

[3905.04 - 3912.7799999999997] you go ask any you know author what they

[3911.099 - 3914.46] um you know how much money ask any

[3912.78 - 3915.9] American Author how much money they make

[3914.46 - 3916.92] for their books that are being sold in

[3915.9 - 3919.319] Iran

[3916.92 - 3920.94] and the answer is going to be zero

[3919.319 - 3922.98] um because basically Iran does not

[3920.94 - 3925.799] respect you and I shouldn't even say

[3922.98 - 3929.04] respect Iran does not recognize U.S

[3925.799 - 3931.44] copyright law so if you want to take a

[3929.04 - 3933.0] American blog translate into Farsi that

[3931.44 - 3935.7000000000003] is completely legal

[3933.0 - 3937.92] um to do that for example and and that's

[3935.7 - 3939.5989999999997] what the local laws are so

[3937.92 - 3941.7000000000003] you're going to have 195 different

[3939.599 - 3943.319] versions of them like I don't know what

[3941.7 - 3945.5989999999997] this is going to look like this is you

[3943.319 - 3947.52] know we get sense of geopolitics

[3945.599 - 3950.339] you know and so forth like the one thing

[3947.52 - 3954.72] that at least I try and do as part of

[3950.339 - 3957.9] all this is I just disclose like crazy

[3954.72 - 3960.7799999999997] so when I'm writing something

[3957.9 - 3962.4] um you know I will if I'm using so the

[3960.78 - 3964.079] example I gave before for what I was

[3962.4 - 3966.299] doing in my class

[3964.079 - 3969.0] in that one specifically I actually

[3966.299 - 3971.339] color coded it and and I literally said

[3969.0 - 3974.099] okay the green section boom and I put in

[3971.339 - 3975.96] footnotes where everything came from and

[3974.099 - 3978.42] how I was prompting like whenever I even

[3975.96 - 3981.78] just use an image so I write on on

[3978.42 - 3983.7000000000003] medium and on my on LinkedIn

[3981.78 - 3987.2400000000002] um if I'm using an AI image which I use

[3983.7 - 3990.359] lots of I will actually put this image

[3987.24 - 3993.0589999999997] uh was developed on mid-journey by

[3990.359 - 3995.339] Michael tedasco on this date from this

[3993.059 - 3997.619] prompt and I literally put it in there

[3995.339 - 4000.2599999999998] verbatim and if I said I'd use Rob

[3997.619 - 4001.94] liefeld as a inspiration in that I will

[4000.26 - 4003.26] say that

[4001.94 - 4006.559] um foreign

[4003.26 - 4009.6800000000003] it's a baby step like like I'm also not

[4006.559 - 4012.619] monetizing this but I'm like at least I

[4009.68 - 4014.8999999999996] think Step One is like being transparent

[4012.619 - 4016.2200000000003] with disclosure on this it makes me feel

[4014.9 - 4020.539] a little bit more comfortable even

[4016.22 - 4023.5989999999997] though like I know if I made a uh a

[4020.539 - 4024.28] picture of a Flying Tomato

[4023.599 - 4027.38] um

[4024.28 - 4029.059] you know even if I didn't say artist X

[4027.38 - 4031.579] in there artist X might still be

[4029.059 - 4033.079] inspiring that

[4031.579 - 4035.7200000000003] that makes sense

[4033.079 - 4038.7200000000003] yeah and and phenomenal breakdown of the

[4035.72 - 4040.2799999999997] problem and and again it's it uh us two

[4038.72 - 4042.3799999999997] talking in an afternoon is not gonna

[4040.28 - 4045.92] we're not going to solve this problem

[4042.38 - 4047.839] um but it's good to to especially as the

[4045.92 - 4048.859] world is catching up because again the

[4047.839 - 4051.339] whole reason that we're doing this

[4048.859 - 4054.319] podcast is things are changing so fast

[4051.339 - 4057.2] and you know we have an opportunity here

[4054.319 - 4058.64] to at least add to the conversation and

[4057.2 - 4060.6189999999997] help demystify it and keep the

[4058.64 - 4063.319] conversation moving forward so just

[4060.619 - 4066.319] thanks again for for coming on and

[4063.319 - 4069.079] sharing all of that perspective

[4066.319 - 4071.119] um phenomenal talk so I have uh just a

[4069.079 - 4073.1600000000003] few few last questions

[4071.119 - 4075.02] um what are you up to now

[4073.16 - 4076.7599999999998] um who do you want to talk to and and

[4075.02 - 4077.96] how do people reach you

[4076.76 - 4080.3590000000004] um if there's anything you want to plug

[4077.96 - 4082.16] or just tell everyone like what is it

[4080.359 - 4085.339] that Mike tedasco is up to now what do

[4082.16 - 4087.319] you want to be known for in 2023

[4085.339 - 4089.0] what do I want to be known for oh man

[4087.319 - 4091.64] you're making me set my goals a few

[4089.0 - 4094.88] weeks early I love it I love it David um

[4091.64 - 4096.679] look I am super super fascinated with

[4094.88 - 4098.2390000000005] world of generative AI I mean the whole

[4096.679 - 4100.16] reason I got to meet you was just

[4098.239 - 4102.739] watching your YouTube videos over the

[4100.16 - 4105.8589999999995] summer and being like Oh my God this guy

[4102.739 - 4107.54] I learned so much from you in these

[4105.859 - 4108.7390000000005] videos of just how to think through a

[4107.54 - 4110.839] problem and like what are the

[4108.739 - 4113.66] limitations and so forth so for that I

[4110.839 - 4114.679] you know I deeply thank you and look I

[4113.66 - 4116.7789999999995] want to

[4114.679 - 4119.12] um meet and I want to just talk to smart

[4116.779 - 4123.14] people in the space

[4119.12 - 4125.96] um I'm fascinated I am I have no agenda

[4123.14 - 4129.799] in many ways like I'm I want to just

[4125.96 - 4132.199] learn and I want us as a society to come

[4129.799 - 4135.199] out in a in a better place than than

[4132.199 - 4137.12] what we can than what we might

[4135.199 - 4139.099999999999] um I want us to not go down that dark

[4137.12 - 4142.099999999999] timeline and I want us to just kind of

[4139.1 - 4143.299] think about it and for me I think it

[4142.1 - 4145.819] means like

[4143.299 - 4147.98] it is an inevitability like I think we

[4145.819 - 4151.52] in many ways as a society just have to

[4147.98 - 4154.04] accept that but given that like what is

[4151.52 - 4157.1] the best way that we can Embrace these

[4154.04 - 4158.6] tools for the most good and look if

[4157.1 - 4159.799] you're if you're a founder and working

[4158.6 - 4161.839] on something and you want to bounce

[4159.799 - 4164.179] ideas off me or you're just interested

[4161.839 - 4166.699] in the space or anything like that

[4164.179 - 4169.4] um I'd love to discuss more

[4166.699 - 4171.44] um so I write on medium and Linkedin as

[4169.4 - 4174.379999999999] I said before uh just my last name

[4171.44 - 4176.7789999999995] tedasco t-o-d-a-s-c-o

[4174.38 - 4178.279] is um where you can reach me on both

[4176.779 - 4180.02] those

[4178.279 - 4182.42] um I'm pretty much read only on Twitter

[4180.02 - 4184.88] but if you do send a tweet to me you I I

[4182.42 - 4187.88] will respond to it um I just don't post

[4184.88 - 4189.259] much myself I'm also a tadasco on

[4187.88 - 4191.66] Twitter

[4189.259 - 4193.339] um uh I mean I I love just the intro

[4191.66 - 4196.4] like you know just today on Twitter I

[4193.339 - 4197.719] found out again just sorry I know we're

[4196.4 - 4199.16] rapping but to throw it out there I

[4197.719 - 4201.199] literally just saw this this morning it

[4199.16 - 4204.139999999999] was a wonderful use case for um

[4201.199 - 4206.96] generative Ai and using um

[4204.14 - 4209.96] um gpt3 there's this thing called help a

[4206.96 - 4212.179] reporter art out agent Haro h-a-r-o and

[4209.96 - 4214.16] it's been around for years and I'm on it

[4212.179 - 4217.82] and like basically it's any reporter in

[4214.16 - 4220.34] the US who meets somebody who's an

[4217.82 - 4223.099999999999] expert in AI or whatever it might be

[4220.34 - 4225.26] just puts out a request and it's this

[4223.1 - 4228.02] huge list hundreds and hundreds of links

[4225.26 - 4229.820000000001] it's a disaster somebody just made this

[4228.02 - 4232.040000000001] thing in zappier that basically says

[4229.82 - 4234.0199999999995] okay when you see that in Gmail

[4232.04 - 4236.12] um fill out this spreadsheets this will

[4234.02 - 4237.7390000000005] have some keywords

[4236.12 - 4239.54] um and then we're going to then send

[4237.739 - 4243.62] that we're going to do some sort of

[4239.54 - 4245.179] match using uh gpt3 and then

[4243.62 - 4248.48] um based on what they're looking for

[4245.179 - 4250.159] based on what you say your abilities are

[4248.48 - 4251.659] we're going to even generate a cover

[4250.159 - 4254.9] letter that you could send out to them

[4251.659 - 4257.179] and to just built that in zapier at like
