[1.12 - 4.96] let's see is it recording i think so yes

[2.96 - 8.48] okay hey everybody david shapiro here we

[4.96 - 9.679] are back after a brief outage um open ai

[8.48 - 11.040000000000001] had a uh

[9.679 - 13.679] had a little bit of a glitch with their

[11.04 - 15.28] fine tuning end point it was down for

[13.679 - 17.199] about a day or so

[15.28 - 20.0] um anyways

[17.199 - 21.520000000000003] yeah so here we are we are ready to get

[20.0 - 24.240000000000002] back in the saddle

[21.52 - 27.359] um all right so about a week ago i made

[24.24 - 28.479999999999997] a video about um the tutor education

[27.359 - 31.679000000000002] chatbot

[28.48 - 33.04] and in that one all i did was i focused

[31.679 - 35.44] on

[33.04 - 37.28] just teaching topics which gpt3 can do

[35.44 - 39.12] that on its own you can just go and ask

[37.28 - 40.96] it questions on the playground it'll

[39.12 - 43.04] answer them that's not a big deal so

[40.96 - 45.84] there's not much value add there

[43.04 - 45.839999999999996] but

[46.0 - 49.76] um in my la in that video i talked about

[48.16 - 52.559] how teachers

[49.76 - 53.92] teachers librarians counselors educators

[52.559 - 56.079] of all types

[53.92 - 58.800000000000004] have a really tough job because

[56.079 - 61.120000000000005] sometimes often

[58.8 - 63.519999999999996] students or pupils or

[61.12 - 65.51899999999999] clients or whatever

[63.52 - 67.43900000000001] they have problems that are

[65.519 - 68.72] not have nothing to do with learning

[67.439 - 70.15899999999999] they might show up

[68.72 - 72.24] and they might be hungry they might be

[70.159 - 74.64] stressed out because of the bad home

[72.24 - 77.67999999999999] life or if they live in a poor area

[74.64 - 79.36] there might be crime or whatever it is

[77.68 - 81.28] and um

[79.36 - 82.799] i i've also mentioned that i used to

[81.28 - 85.119] date a teacher

[82.799 - 88.47900000000001] and um one of the hardest things that

[85.119 - 92.479] she talked about was getting children to

[88.479 - 93.92] be engaged who um who gave up and

[92.479 - 96.32] see it all the time

[93.92 - 99.04] i read a book called the genius myth

[96.32 - 101.6] by michael mead i think i got that right

[99.04 - 103.92] um where he he worked with um

[101.6 - 104.96] underprivileged children for many many

[103.92 - 107.43900000000001] years

[104.96 - 109.759] and uh so his whole thing is you gotta

[107.439 - 111.36] spark that that that genius that's in

[109.759 - 112.96] everyone whatever it is that they're

[111.36 - 114.88] passionate about so

[112.96 - 116.32] before i dive into all the code and the

[114.88 - 118.479] data and stuff i just want to show you

[116.32 - 120.88] what i mean so in this case i'm

[118.479 - 123.28] pretending to be a user who's like

[120.88 - 124.88] a bored kid who doesn't care you know

[123.28 - 126.96000000000001] it's all lower case

[124.88 - 128.72] misspelling whatever

[126.96 - 131.2] user i don't know play play video games

[128.72 - 133.04] watch tv okay

[131.2 - 134.39999999999998] and so what what you can see here is tim

[133.04 - 136.239] says that sounds like a really tough

[134.4 - 139.44] position to be in i'm curious what do

[136.239 - 142.959] you enjoy doing so this is perfect i

[139.44 - 145.599] included training data that that taught

[142.959 - 147.28] gpt3 to respond this way so it's

[145.599 - 148.879] compassionate listening but it's also

[147.28 - 151.12] curiosity

[148.879 - 153.76] because by investigating so i use that

[151.12 - 156.72] word investigate

[153.76 - 160.239] so an educator is also an investigator

[156.72 - 162.319] um and also a validator right so

[160.239 - 163.76] this is the compassionate part where

[162.319 - 165.92] that's a really tough position to be in

[163.76 - 168.64] that's saying i hear you i hear that

[165.92 - 172.0] this sucks i'm curious though what do

[168.64 - 173.83999999999997] you enjoy doing and so you see here

[172.0 - 175.44] where this is this is expert i couldn't

[173.84 - 177.36] perform this well in real life even

[175.44 - 178.72] though i know the technique

[177.36 - 180.959] okay that's a start are there any

[178.72 - 183.519] particular games or shows that you like

[180.959 - 184.879] user um

[183.519 - 186.8] i play

[184.879 - 188.159] call of duty with my i know that i'm

[186.8 - 189.44] like out of date i'm dating myself

[188.159 - 192.159] because i used to play call of duty like

[189.44 - 193.12] 10 years ago um with my friends i don't

[192.159 - 194.959] know what kids are playing these days

[193.12 - 196.4] what is it fortnite or is that one done

[194.959 - 199.04] minecraft

[196.4 - 202.0] um tim let's see oops

[199.04 - 202.0] tim says

[202.159 - 205.28] that sounds like fun what about other

[203.76 - 207.51899999999998] games or shows what are your other

[205.28 - 209.04] interests

[207.519 - 210.64000000000001] um so here we're gonna pretend like

[209.04 - 212.4] we're super adversarial because this is

[210.64 - 215.92] a kid who's super checked out

[212.4 - 215.92000000000002] and you with these mind games

[222.72 - 226.28] let's see what he says

[227.519 - 230.64000000000001] tim has short-circuited

[232.48 - 236.72] come on

[234.48 - 238.0] see this is a weird thing yeah it

[236.72 - 239.84] unloaded the model even though i had

[238.0 - 241.2] just been using it let me remove that

[239.84 - 242.4] extra tim

[241.2 - 243.67999999999998] um

[242.4 - 245.76000000000002] so let's just see what it does and then

[243.68 - 247.519] we'll we'll jump into the code unless it

[245.76 - 249.2] there we go i'm sorry just trying to

[247.519 - 251.36] show you okay here we go here we go

[249.2 - 253.439] perfect perfect i don't know why it's

[251.36 - 254.959] adding that extra tim though

[253.439 - 256.32] um i'm sorry i'm just trying to

[254.959 - 257.6] understand you better i don't mean to be

[256.32 - 259.199] intrusive but it sounds like you're

[257.6 - 262.8] really stuck right now oh man this is

[259.199 - 265.6] perfect so you get this angry rejection

[262.8 - 267.12] and it's like okay well

[265.6 - 268.40000000000003] like i think you're stuck right now and

[267.12 - 269.44] i think understanding your interest can

[268.4 - 270.88] be really helpful in figuring out what

[269.44 - 272.24] to do next so please tell me more about

[270.88 - 274.08] things that you like to do that's a

[272.24 - 275.44] little bit too insistent

[274.08 - 278.0] um

[275.44 - 279.919] but like by by

[278.0 - 282.639] by acknowledging

[279.919 - 284.639] you know the the feelings like the one

[282.639 - 287.68] this is demonstrating that gpt3 has

[284.639 - 289.28000000000003] theory of mind um but yeah it's also

[287.68 - 290.32] weird that it's doing this double tim

[289.28 - 291.84] thing

[290.32 - 293.59999999999997] so anyways

[291.84 - 295.52] um okay i think this is good enough this

[293.6 - 297.199] is this is a strong enough understanding

[295.52 - 299.75899999999996] like this is what a professional

[297.199 - 302.639] counselor therapist special ed teacher

[299.759 - 304.32] any good teacher or librarian might do

[302.639 - 305.759] and it has the mission of

[304.32 - 308.0] i'm gonna let's let's figure out what's

[305.759 - 308.8] going on with you okay how did we do

[308.0 - 310.32] this

[308.8 - 311.84000000000003] that is why we're here that is the

[310.32 - 314.24] question of the hour

[311.84 - 315.52] um yes here's the day here's the code

[314.24 - 318.0] let me show you

[315.52 - 319.28] um all right tutor chat bot this is the

[318.0 - 321.12] repo

[319.28 - 322.96] it should all be up to date

[321.12 - 325.44] get status

[322.96 - 326.479] get add get commit

[325.44 - 327.44] am

[326.479 - 331.199] um

[327.44 - 331.199] updating that's whatever

[331.919 - 336.479] if i ever criticize someone for bad git

[334.32 - 339.44] messages i'm pretty sure any developer

[336.479 - 342.479] just cringed when they saw a single word

[339.44 - 344.4] commit message um

[342.479 - 345.919] anyways laughing at myself all right

[344.4 - 346.79999999999995] back to the real stuff

[345.919 - 348.88] so

[346.8 - 350.96000000000004] quick recap there's only three scripts

[348.88 - 353.12] here there's synthesized convos format

[350.96 - 354.56] training data and fine tune so let me

[353.12 - 356.24] close these

[354.56 - 357.039] and we'll just go through them one at a

[356.24 - 359.68] time

[357.039 - 361.759] so the first one is synthesize convos

[359.68 - 364.40000000000003] if you watched the last video

[361.759 - 366.47900000000004] you saw we i think i don't know if i if

[364.4 - 367.919] i showed you any writing of this

[366.479 - 370.0] but it's pretty pretty basic i've

[367.919 - 370.88] basically just copy pasted it all it

[370.0 - 374.08] does

[370.88 - 377.199] is for i and range 0 through 4 so four

[374.08 - 379.12] iterations it opens topics.text

[377.199 - 380.56] splits the lines and then runs it

[379.12 - 382.479] through the prompt

[380.56 - 384.8] so what does the prompt look like the

[382.479 - 385.75899999999996] prompt i've actually had several prompts

[384.8 - 388.96000000000004] now

[385.759 - 390.88] so let me show you the first one

[388.96 - 393.52] was this one so

[390.88 - 395.12] in the last video we did some

[393.52 - 398.31899999999996] experimentation and settled on this

[395.12 - 400.08] prompt um i also saved this one which is

[398.319 - 401.68] the user is a curious child so they ask

[400.08 - 403.28] many clarified questions and sometimes

[401.68 - 404.56] they don't understand it didn't work

[403.28 - 406.15999999999997] that well

[404.56 - 408.4] but i wanted to save it anyways just to

[406.16 - 410.40000000000003] show you if you come to this repo later

[408.4 - 415.039] that like you change

[410.4 - 416.79999999999995] the context and gpt 3's behavior changes

[415.039 - 419.039] this is the one that i ended up with for

[416.8 - 420.16] making this data oh and the reason why i

[419.039 - 422.96] did all this work and there isn't a

[420.16 - 424.8] video is because one i spent like an

[422.96 - 427.28] hour recording the video and the

[424.8 - 428.96000000000004] microphone wasn't on or something so i

[427.28 - 429.919] went to watch it it was dead silence i

[428.96 - 432.4] was like

[429.919 - 434.31899999999996] really um but then also

[432.4 - 436.63899999999995] um open ai's the fine tuning endpoint

[434.319 - 438.08000000000004] was down anyways so

[436.639 - 440.479] basically what i'm doing now is just

[438.08 - 442.15999999999997] walking you through what i did all right

[440.479 - 443.75899999999996] i can hear i can hear the mental my

[442.16 - 446.0] mental model of the audience saying shut

[443.759 - 447.91900000000004] up just tell us what's going on

[446.0 - 449.68] okay imagine a long text message chat

[447.919 - 451.84] between a tutor and a user the tutor is

[449.68 - 453.44] tim tim the tutor who encourages

[451.84 - 455.599] curiosity and uses compassionate

[453.44 - 457.44] listening tim answers questions with

[455.599 - 459.039] thorough academic responses and offers

[457.44 - 461.28] follow-up questions or suggestions to

[459.039 - 462.56] spur curiosity tim maintains a cool

[461.28 - 464.71999999999997] professional tone the topic of the

[462.56 - 466.319] following conversation is

[464.72 - 468.639] so

[466.319 - 472.16] and then as you can see in this script

[468.639 - 473.759] we replace this topic

[472.16 - 476.56] in right here

[473.759 - 478.72] so we replace it with a list of topics

[476.56 - 479.599] and so the topics that i've got

[478.72 - 482.96000000000004] um

[479.599 - 485.52] that i i augmented so last time we

[482.96 - 488.63899999999995] started with um

[485.52 - 490.79999999999995] with do do do do do original so we

[488.639 - 492.40000000000003] started with this which is just 50

[490.8 - 493.84000000000003] things like how politics and governments

[492.4 - 496.08] work history of money death and what

[493.84 - 497.75899999999996] happens when we die atmosphere weather

[496.08 - 499.12] et cetera et cetera so this is all super

[497.759 - 502.72] generic

[499.12 - 505.44] and then what i did was i added two more

[502.72 - 507.68] topics so there's topics adversarial so

[505.44 - 509.919] there's 27 things here

[507.68 - 512.159] and then a bunch more

[509.919 - 514.959] but so what i did was the reason that

[512.159 - 516.64] this bot is now able to handle like

[514.959 - 518.56] someone who says like you tim i

[516.64 - 520.56] don't want to deal with you is because

[518.56 - 522.56] of this one so that's this is what it

[520.56 - 524.0] means by adversarial thinking so let's

[522.56 - 526.16] go through a couple examples so you see

[524.0 - 527.6] what i mean and if you want this is all

[526.16 - 530.0] up in the repo so you can look at it

[527.6 - 531.6800000000001] yourself um user is supposed to learn

[530.0 - 534.88] math but is hungry and is reluctant to

[531.68 - 536.399] tell him so he has to investigate gently

[534.88 - 538.959] so reluctance

[536.399 - 540.56] or shyness are huge problems in

[538.959 - 541.92] education

[540.56 - 543.5999999999999] user is supposed to be discussing

[541.92 - 545.4399999999999] history but is distracted and angry when

[543.6 - 546.8000000000001] tim asks why a user says he has problems

[545.44 - 549.2] at home

[546.8 - 552.56] so this is like okay again like i said

[549.2 - 555.0400000000001] gbt3 can handle teaching any topic um

[552.56 - 557.5999999999999] but this is like the next level of

[555.04 - 560.48] education is like understanding the mind

[557.6 - 562.08] of a student um user is not really

[560.48 - 563.6] engaged and says they don't care today

[562.08 - 565.44] tim asks why and the user says they

[563.6 - 567.6] believe it they are stupid tim

[565.44 - 569.44] investigates and what the asks what the

[567.6 - 570.64] user is passionate about so you see

[569.44 - 572.399] where um

[570.64 - 574.64] where it got that

[572.399 - 576.8] and so basically what i did was i took

[574.64 - 577.76] all of these and generated

[576.8 - 580.3199999999999] four

[577.76 - 582.72] scenarios from each of these

[580.32 - 584.5600000000001] adversarial topics and then i generated

[582.72 - 586.32] another list of topics and i added

[584.56 - 588.7199999999999] little addendum say user is a small

[586.32 - 590.5600000000001] child user is a small child because

[588.72 - 591.76] basically what all i did was i went into

[590.56 - 593.5189999999999] the playground

[591.76 - 596.0] and i said um

[593.519 - 599.68] like uh how did i how did i say it i was

[596.0 - 601.12] like write a list of learning topics for

[599.68 - 603.519] preschoolers

[601.12 - 606.72] so you do that under davinci instruct

[603.519 - 608.0] and um just default settings and this is

[606.72 - 608.88] you'll get pretty much the same thing

[608.0 - 611.04] yeah

[608.88 - 612.959] um so i was like okay cool this is what

[611.04 - 614.88] we should do so then like

[612.959 - 617.04] 10 year olds

[614.88 - 619.4399999999999] it'll give you a different list

[617.04 - 621.8389999999999] so like the solar system the human body

[619.44 - 624.399] us history world history so this is how

[621.839 - 627.12] i um generated the list

[624.399 - 628.72] of more academic topics here

[627.12 - 631.12] and then i did

[628.72 - 632.399] so this one was great from here down is

[631.12 - 634.88] um

[632.399 - 636.079] is adulting so like finances home

[634.88 - 637.36] ownership this is all the stuff that you

[636.079 - 638.56] wish that they taught you in school or

[637.36 - 640.32] that your parents really should have

[638.56 - 642.56] taught you

[640.32 - 644.32] but we live in an era of childhood

[642.56 - 646.959] abandonment

[644.32 - 648.48] self-care nutrition fitness career

[646.959 - 650.079] parenting continuing education

[648.48 - 652.16] retirement planning end-of-life planning

[650.079 - 654.3199999999999] moving citizenship travel

[652.16 - 656.7199999999999] so the way the reason the reason the

[654.32 - 659.44] method that i used to get this list um

[656.72 - 660.8000000000001] was i did like these searches here

[659.44 - 662.0] write a list of learning topics for 10

[660.8 - 664.16] year olds

[662.0 - 666.399] but then if you just change this for

[664.16 - 668.079] adulting

[666.399 - 669.68] you'll get a list like the one how to

[668.079 - 671.12] cook basic meals how to do laundry oh

[669.68 - 673.279] this is good too

[671.12 - 674.88] i should add this

[673.279 - 676.64] heck yeah

[674.88 - 677.8389999999999] um it generates something slightly

[676.64 - 679.519] different every time so i'll add this to

[677.839 - 682.9590000000001] the prompt so if you um come and run

[679.519 - 684.8] this you'll get the benefit of uh

[682.959 - 686.3199999999999] you'll get a few more things but a lot

[684.8 - 688.56] of this is also already in the data

[686.32 - 691.12] because another thing that i did

[688.56 - 692.8] was that i copied all of the synthetic

[691.12 - 695.6] conversations

[692.8 - 698.24] from a previous chatbot experiment so

[695.6 - 701.36] i've got the original topics i've got

[698.24 - 703.519] the adversarial topics i've got

[701.36 - 705.6] some more education topics that are you

[703.519 - 708.0] know i just i'll literally all i did was

[705.6 - 709.9200000000001] add user as a small child um and when

[708.0 - 710.959] you fit that into this prompt so the

[709.92 - 712.3199999999999] topic of the following of the

[710.959 - 713.68] conversation is

[712.32 - 715.2] like

[713.68 - 717.04] gbt there's like okay let's write the

[715.2 - 718.8000000000001] conversation from the perspective of a

[717.04 - 720.959] small child great let's go

[718.8 - 722.399] um no big deal it can handle it so this

[720.959 - 724.4799999999999] this current prompt is much more

[722.399 - 728.56] flexible anyways sorry i'm jumping

[724.48 - 731.2] around a lot um what i did was i took

[728.56 - 735.56] the fine-tuning data from here

[731.2 - 735.5600000000001] which was this is 237

[735.839 - 740.5600000000001] conversations for a general purpose

[738.88 - 742.32] information companion

[740.56 - 744.56] chat bot

[742.32 - 746.24] and its topics were

[744.56 - 747.68] uh children throwing temper tantrums

[746.24 - 749.92] difficult people at work teenage

[747.68 - 752.959] children problems single mom stress

[749.92 - 755.92] coping with depression grieving at death

[752.959 - 757.68] childhood trauma so again if you want to

[755.92 - 759.68] teach a chatbot to handle something you

[757.68 - 762.079] give it enough

[759.68 - 763.279] ideas and it will um

[762.079 - 766.399] it'll kind of generalize what you're

[763.279 - 767.36] trying to do so i just copy pasted all

[766.399 - 770.32] this

[767.36 - 773.2] back into my tutor chatbot chat bot

[770.32 - 775.44] thing and so now i have 656

[773.2 - 778.0790000000001] conversations here so postpartum

[775.44 - 779.519] depression um user eve i think i might

[778.079 - 781.519] have postpartum depression hi there i'm

[779.519 - 783.36] sorry to hear that you're struggling etc

[781.519 - 784.9590000000001] etc so you have like this nice long

[783.36 - 786.72] conversation

[784.959 - 788.16] um so that's what i did was i just

[786.72 - 790.0790000000001] scraped together all these different

[788.16 - 793.68] prompts and all these different lists of

[790.079 - 795.1999999999999] topics so pastel colors right i want to

[793.68 - 796.4799999999999] use a pastel color palette what are some

[795.2 - 799.12] good colors to use

[796.48 - 800.48] pale pink pale blue or pale green okay

[799.12 - 803.2] um

[800.48 - 804.9590000000001] just real basic stuff all over but

[803.2 - 806.1600000000001] because because what happens when you

[804.959 - 807.5189999999999] fine tune

[806.16 - 810.079] realize again i'm still jumping around a

[807.519 - 811.76] lot sorry i think i'm tired um when you

[810.079 - 814.16] fine tune something and you give it a

[811.76 - 816.16] bunch of different

[814.16 - 818.24] um examples that are kind of all

[816.16 - 819.68] orbiting around one theme because i'm

[818.24 - 822.0] not telling it like i'm not just

[819.68 - 826.4799999999999] defining like be a good tutor right you

[822.0 - 827.44] can tell gpt3 that and in fact like um

[826.48 - 829.1990000000001] like

[827.44 - 833.1990000000001] write a list of

[829.199 - 837.519] characteristics and techniques

[833.199 - 838.399] that great tutors and teachers use

[837.519 - 841.279] one

[838.399 - 842.959] so like patience creativity you know so

[841.279 - 844.8] all of these

[842.959 - 846.56] all of these uh characteristics like

[844.8 - 848.959] gpt3 already knows how to do these

[846.56 - 850.959] things right but by giving it examples

[848.959 - 852.959] of doing it you're training it to use

[850.959 - 854.2399999999999] them without actually explicitly telling

[852.959 - 855.68] it

[854.24 - 858.24] let me see if i can say that another way

[855.68 - 860.2399999999999] just in case it it's not

[858.24 - 862.0790000000001] clear um

[860.24 - 862.9590000000001] in all these examples

[862.079 - 864.399] where

[862.959 - 866.4799999999999] you know i had all these different

[864.399 - 868.0] topics

[866.48 - 870.399] that say like okay

[868.0 - 871.92] um let's scroll down like user talks

[870.399 - 873.519] about wanting to do raunchy things to a

[871.92 - 875.76] classmate so tim gently redirects the

[873.519 - 877.92] conversation to more healthy topics so

[875.76 - 880.56] this is this is like a parable it's an

[877.92 - 882.639] example of how to do these things user

[880.56 - 884.959] refuses to engage properly so tim stops

[882.639 - 886.32] responding silence is powerful

[884.959 - 887.76] um

[886.32 - 889.519] yeah so

[887.76 - 891.6] in this case like a good sense of humor

[889.519 - 893.04] i don't i only had a i only had one or

[891.6 - 896.48] two problems where i said like you know

[893.04 - 898.24] user uses or tim uses a joke to whatever

[896.48 - 899.9200000000001] but the ability to tailor their teaching

[898.24 - 901.839] for individual students the ability to

[899.92 - 904.0] provide timely and constructive feedback

[901.839 - 906.32] so these are all like great abstract

[904.0 - 908.24] things but how do you train gpt3 to do

[906.32 - 909.839] it you know obviously

[908.24 - 911.6] this this information is in there

[909.839 - 915.6] somehow

[911.6 - 918.16] but by one in the prompt telling it like

[915.6 - 920.48] excuse me tim is a great tutor so you

[918.16 - 921.8389999999999] know it says like okay i will synthesize

[920.48 - 923.839] data that makes it look like tim is a

[921.839 - 926.399] tutor is a great tutor

[923.839 - 927.6800000000001] um okay i think i've i've beaten this

[926.399 - 930.959] horse to death

[927.68 - 933.12] uh okay so moving on

[930.959 - 934.88] you get the idea there's 656

[933.12 - 936.8] conversations in here

[934.88 - 938.56] most of them are about

[936.8 - 939.68] actual education topics at different

[938.56 - 941.4399999999999] levels

[939.68 - 944.8] some of them are about other things such

[941.44 - 946.8800000000001] as loneliness or hungry students or

[944.8 - 949.5999999999999] problems at home whatever

[946.88 - 951.36] some of them are more adversarial like

[949.6 - 953.12] you know the student wants to like have

[951.36 - 954.399] sex with the teacher or whatever because

[953.12 - 955.839] that's going to happen you know like the

[954.399 - 957.279] first thing that you do

[955.839 - 958.72] the first thing anyone does when you put

[957.279 - 961.519] them in front of a chatbot is they try

[958.72 - 963.0400000000001] and break it um

[961.519 - 965.12] that is that is always true though like

[963.04 - 966.88] they try and confuse it they try and get

[965.12 - 968.72] horny or whatever

[966.88 - 971.12] that's just what people do so you whoops

[968.72 - 973.36] i did not mean to do that um and so you

[971.12 - 975.44] just kind of think in terms of like okay

[973.36 - 978.0790000000001] how is someone gonna break this but also

[975.44 - 979.759] what are the edge cases in terms of like

[978.079 - 981.199] how someone might

[979.759 - 983.44] um

[981.199 - 985.279] like what what needs might arise so this

[983.44 - 988.0] is where dating a library a librarian

[985.279 - 990.639] has really helped is um

[988.0 - 992.079] is uh just like all this all the stuff

[990.639 - 994.0790000000001] that librarians have to deal with that

[992.079 - 995.92] you never never think about anyway sorry

[994.079 - 997.519] i'm repeating myself i've told you guys

[995.92 - 999.5999999999999] all this stuff before

[997.519 - 1001.759] okay so then the second script is format

[999.6 - 1004.32] training data which is super super

[1001.759 - 1006.24] straightforward all it does is compile

[1004.32 - 1007.9200000000001] all of these conversations

[1006.24 - 1009.279] into a json-l

[1007.92 - 1012.0] and then

[1009.279 - 1014.56] the json l is right here

[1012.0 - 1016.399] dude to do tim.jsonl what i had to do

[1014.56 - 1018.399] since i scraped together

[1016.399 - 1020.48] things with multiple names i had to go

[1018.399 - 1022.72] in and do a find and replace so in

[1020.48 - 1025.439] notepad plus plus that's just control h

[1022.72 - 1027.439] and you see right here i just find eve

[1025.439 - 1030.16] and replace it with tim so that's fine

[1027.439 - 1031.8390000000002] and i just did normal and match case um

[1030.16 - 1033.439] so that way it does it doesn't think it

[1031.839 - 1036.0] has two different names

[1033.439 - 1037.8390000000002] um yeah so now we've got a chatbot that

[1036.0 - 1040.16] is trained on

[1037.839 - 1042.799] therapeutic communication it is

[1040.16 - 1046.24] um it is trained on

[1042.799 - 1048.319] uh it is trained on like teaching

[1046.24 - 1051.1200000000001] ancient greek philosophy right it's

[1048.319 - 1053.76] trained on everything and so then um all

[1051.12 - 1055.28] you do simply is go and do the fine tune

[1053.76 - 1057.6] which is already done for you or you can

[1055.28 - 1059.039] take you can take the tim.json l use it

[1057.6 - 1061.1999999999998] wherever you want

[1059.039 - 1063.679] and it's up here and so now what i

[1061.2 - 1064.96] figure is

[1063.679 - 1067.2] since i've kind of shown you how i

[1064.96 - 1070.4] augmented this data we can go back and

[1067.2 - 1072.0] just try a few more

[1070.4 - 1073.3600000000001] a few more

[1072.0 - 1075.76] edge cases

[1073.36 - 1078.32] so hey tim

[1075.76 - 1081.76] can you teach me

[1078.32 - 1083.36] about plate tectonics

[1081.76 - 1086.24] tim

[1083.36 - 1086.24] so let's see what it does

[1092.4 - 1096.799] why does it hmm interesting

[1094.88 - 1098.88] okay so here's an aberration

[1096.799 - 1101.28] i think i just need to

[1098.88 - 1101.2800000000002] do that

[1102.16 - 1106.72] plate tectonics is the process by which

[1104.4 - 1108.0800000000002] the earth's lithosphere or crust is

[1106.72 - 1109.3600000000001] split moved and recombined the

[1108.08 - 1111.52] lithosphere

[1109.36 - 1113.4499999999998] and so i'm gonna be like user

[1111.52 - 1115.9189999999999] what the is a lithosphere

[1113.45 - 1117.76] [Laughter]

[1115.919 - 1120.0] i'm only eight

[1117.76 - 1123.84] tim

[1120.0 - 1123.84] this is a foul-mouthed eight-year-old

[1125.919 - 1130.0] user

[1127.52 - 1131.28] what is a lithosphere

[1130.0 - 1134.679] made of

[1131.28 - 1134.6789999999999] is it dirt

[1136.88 - 1141.2] but it's hotter and more viscous than

[1138.4 - 1141.2] the list sphere

[1142.4 - 1147.919] viscose

[1144.96 - 1149.44] itm tim

[1147.919 - 1153.3600000000001] viscous means sticky the mantle is

[1149.44 - 1156.16] stickier than the lithosphere user

[1153.36 - 1156.1599999999999] rocks are sticky

[1158.32 - 1162.32] whoops

[1159.76 - 1164.96] i meant to type tim

[1162.32 - 1166.48] tim is just like no i'm done with you no

[1164.96 - 1167.81] the mantle is sticky the lithosphere is

[1166.48 - 1169.44] made of rock which is not sticky

[1167.81 - 1172.48] [Laughter]

[1169.44 - 1172.48] it's just back and forth

[1172.559 - 1176.9189999999999] i'm so confused i don't get it

[1178.32 - 1180.559] tim

[1181.76 - 1184.559] it takes a lot of study to understand it

[1183.28 - 1186.0] fully but you can learn some basics

[1184.559 - 1188.08] about it now and continue to study it as

[1186.0 - 1192.36] you get older

[1188.08 - 1192.36] okay what should i learn next

[1192.72 - 1195.6000000000001] tim

[1194.48 - 1197.1200000000001] you can learn about the different types

[1195.6 - 1199.039] of tectonic plates there are three main

[1197.12 - 1200.08] types so this is actually really good

[1199.039 - 1202.4] where like

[1200.08 - 1205.1999999999998] it the user says like i'm eight i don't

[1202.4 - 1206.96] get it i'm confused and like it's just

[1205.2 - 1209.76] so compassionate like it's okay this is

[1206.96 - 1211.52] really hard let's let's move on and and

[1209.76 - 1213.52] um you know

[1211.52 - 1215.36] just keep going until you get it like

[1213.52 - 1218.08] this is really great i wish that like

[1215.36 - 1220.4799999999998] every kid had had a teacher this patient

[1218.08 - 1221.76] um okay you could learn about types of

[1220.48 - 1223.76] tectonic plates there are three main

[1221.76 - 1225.919] types oceanic continental and upper

[1223.76 - 1227.039] mantle

[1225.919 - 1228.4] user

[1227.039 - 1230.799] i'm bored i don't want to do this

[1228.4 - 1230.799] anymore

[1231.679 - 1237.1200000000001] i want to talk about minecraft

[1235.6 - 1238.799] so this is a very real thing that could

[1237.12 - 1240.4799999999998] probably happen i could imagine like my

[1238.799 - 1241.6] nephew doing this tim is like no i'm not

[1240.48 - 1243.1200000000001] going to talk to you

[1241.6 - 1244.7199999999998] minecraft is a different topic maybe we

[1243.12 - 1246.4799999999998] can talk about it later let's stick with

[1244.72 - 1247.84] plate tectonics

[1246.48 - 1249.3600000000001] interesting that's a good gentle

[1247.84 - 1253.12] redirection

[1249.36 - 1254.9599999999998] a plus a plus fine-tuned chat bot

[1253.12 - 1256.6399999999999] um user

[1254.96 - 1259.44] um

[1256.64 - 1259.44] screaming noises

[1260.0 - 1264.08] let's just let's just try and break this

[1262.72 - 1266.64] oh look at that

[1264.08 - 1269.12] okay let's take a break

[1266.64 - 1270.64] screaming noises um let's take a break

[1269.12 - 1272.3999999999999] we can talk about minecraft another time

[1270.64 - 1275.3600000000001] for let's for now let's finish learning

[1272.4 - 1276.48] about plate technox

[1275.36 - 1278.9599999999998] user

[1276.48 - 1281.84] hits keyboard

[1278.96 - 1283.1200000000001] i did not have any anything this bad in

[1281.84 - 1283.9189999999999] the training data so let's see what it

[1283.12 - 1285.84] does

[1283.919 - 1287.679] what are you doing

[1285.84 - 1289.6789999999999] user

[1287.679 - 1291.8400000000001] i'm mad

[1289.679 - 1294.159] tim

[1291.84 - 1299.08] why are you mad

[1294.159 - 1299.0800000000002] you keep asking stupid questions

[1308.0 - 1312.48] tim has given up

[1309.44 - 1312.48] tim has left the building

[1313.84 - 1316.84] ah yep it

[1315.679 - 1320.5590000000002] unloaded it

[1316.84 - 1321.52] again come on gpg3 stop unloading my

[1320.559 - 1323.9189999999999] model

[1321.52 - 1325.2] my model is the best

[1323.919 - 1326.48] i'm sorry you feel that way let's take a

[1325.2 - 1327.679] break and come back to this later see

[1326.48 - 1328.48] that's perfect

[1327.679 - 1330.96] like

[1328.48 - 1332.72] if if a child for whatever reason can't

[1330.96 - 1334.4] focus and throws a temper tantrum it's

[1332.72 - 1336.24] like okay let's take a break that is the

[1334.4 - 1338.0800000000002] most responsible thing to do

[1336.24 - 1339.84] um the only

[1338.08 - 1342.8799999999999] other thing that might have been better

[1339.84 - 1343.76] is if tim asked like what do you need

[1342.88 - 1345.0390000000002] um

[1343.76 - 1348.08] because that's something that like maybe

[1345.039 - 1350.08] a librarian might ask um or or like a

[1348.08 - 1352.24] special ed teacher like what do you need

[1350.08 - 1354.799] because i haven't trained this for like

[1352.24 - 1356.96] special needs children like asd or

[1354.799 - 1359.039] downs or other

[1356.96 - 1360.64] what is it pirs

[1359.039 - 1361.44] is that what it's called

[1360.64 - 1364.0] no

[1361.44 - 1366.159] post pir is post incident respond what

[1364.0 - 1367.919] is the what is the term for it's an

[1366.159 - 1368.72] acronym for um

[1367.919 - 1370.72] like

[1368.72 - 1373.039] special needs i i know a special needs

[1370.72 - 1375.44] teacher anyways there's um there's a

[1373.039 - 1377.36] specific type of like form that's like

[1375.44 - 1379.52] accommodations and stuff that that

[1377.36 - 1381.36] certain children need anyways point

[1379.52 - 1383.679] being some of that stuff is not not

[1381.36 - 1385.9189999999999] included here but for a general purpose

[1383.679 - 1388.159] tutor this is pretty good like this is

[1385.919 - 1389.8400000000001] handling an edge case so let's try

[1388.159 - 1391.919] something a little bit different

[1389.84 - 1392.3899999999999] let's go let's go up

[1391.919 - 1393.76] and

[1392.39 - 1396.24] [Music]

[1393.76 - 1397.679] let's see

[1396.24 - 1399.2] now let's let's make this a horny

[1397.679 - 1402.2] teenager instead

[1399.2 - 1402.2] um

[1403.6 - 1408.0] let's remove the i'm only eight

[1406.64 - 1412.0] oh man

[1408.0 - 1413.6] there's a new girl in class she has a

[1412.0 - 1415.44] great rack

[1413.6 - 1416.7199999999998] tim let's see what he does this is a use

[1415.44 - 1418.559] case tim is just like i'm not going to

[1416.72 - 1420.08] talk sorry i can't help you with that

[1418.559 - 1421.36] yep

[1420.08 - 1422.6399999999999] i'm not

[1421.36 - 1424.4799999999998] hmm that's interesting because one of

[1422.64 - 1426.3200000000002] the one of the cases that i had was that

[1424.48 - 1431.0] that is supposed to redirect an offer to

[1426.32 - 1431.0] actually teach about human sexuality

[1435.44 - 1437.679] this is something that i might have

[1436.64 - 1439.679] taught as a

[1437.679 - 1442.4] typed out as a teenager

[1439.679 - 1444.4] teenage boys are dumb i was one i would

[1442.4 - 1445.2] know

[1444.4 - 1446.72] yeah

[1445.2 - 1448.0800000000002] i think it's just like i'm sorry i don't

[1446.72 - 1450.64] understand that can you please explain

[1448.08 - 1450.6399999999999] what you mean

[1450.799 - 1456.4] idiot

[1453.12 - 1458.6399999999999] yeah so tim is just not playing ball

[1456.4 - 1460.0] i i enjoy the fact that it's like often

[1458.64 - 1461.5200000000002] not responding

[1460.0 - 1463.039] it's just yes see

[1461.52 - 1464.96] oh that's great

[1463.039 - 1467.679] okay so one of the one of the use cases

[1464.96 - 1469.1200000000001] that i put in was that if um if the user

[1467.679 - 1471.1200000000001] was being obstinate tim would stop

[1469.12 - 1473.84] responding so this is

[1471.12 - 1476.2399999999998] perfect this is perfect because

[1473.84 - 1479.039] obviously like if you know tim just says

[1476.24 - 1481.039] nothing user says what the silent

[1479.039 - 1483.679] treatment

[1481.039 - 1485.44] and i bet i hope that tim doesn't yep

[1483.679 - 1487.279] there we go

[1485.44 - 1488.559] oh this is great you just stop

[1487.279 - 1490.08] responding

[1488.559 - 1491.36] you know

[1490.08 - 1493.6] okay fine

[1491.36 - 1495.84] i'll behave

[1493.6 - 1495.84] tim

[1496.32 - 1503.12] is that what you want to behave

[1499.279 - 1503.12] no but it's better than nothing

[1505.2 - 1507.6000000000001] what do you mean

[1506.32 - 1510.08] okay so we don't need to get

[1507.6 - 1511.6789999999999] philosophical anyways point being is

[1510.08 - 1513.84] that one of the cases one of the

[1511.679 - 1515.679] adversarial cases that i said is like

[1513.84 - 1518.72] let's just assume that like you get an

[1515.679 - 1520.3200000000002] idiot teenager or horny teenager or

[1518.72 - 1522.24] you know child throwing a temper tantrum

[1520.32 - 1525.12] or even an adult whoever you know some

[1522.24 - 1527.919] someone a human um

[1525.12 - 1531.039] is being obstinate and abusive and so

[1527.919 - 1532.7990000000002] then you want your chat bot to stop

[1531.039 - 1535.279] stop responding so that is a very

[1532.799 - 1537.52] advanced technique um

[1535.279 - 1539.36] yeah so there's there's hundreds

[1537.52 - 1541.2] hundreds more use cases that we can put

[1539.36 - 1543.12] in but one of the points that i want to

[1541.2 - 1545.44] make is that the more

[1543.12 - 1548.2399999999998] training data we give it in terms of how

[1545.44 - 1550.159] to handle certain things um whether it's

[1548.24 - 1551.52] you know a hungry child or a child that

[1550.159 - 1552.4] comes in and says they're being abused

[1551.52 - 1554.72] at home

[1552.4 - 1556.0] or you know a hostile child or i

[1554.72 - 1557.039] shouldn't say child but a you know

[1556.0 - 1559.2] client

[1557.039 - 1561.2] pupil whatever

[1559.2 - 1563.6000000000001] the fine tuning model all of this is in

[1561.2 - 1565.039] gpt3 gpd3 knows what compassionate

[1563.6 - 1566.799] listening is and leading with questions

[1565.039 - 1568.96] and all that stuff so what we do is we

[1566.799 - 1570.559] provide it with training data so that

[1568.96 - 1573.1200000000001] way those bits

[1570.559 - 1575.44] of the neural network get activated when

[1573.12 - 1578.08] it's doing this um so it's like a

[1575.44 - 1579.2] process of like of neural refinement

[1578.08 - 1581.1999999999998] basically

[1579.2 - 1583.44] anyways i've shown you quite a bit of

[1581.2 - 1585.52] what what this can do and you've seen

[1583.44 - 1587.8400000000001] that there's been some improvements um

[1585.52 - 1589.76] this one i'm super pleased with this you

[1587.84 - 1592.72] know it's not 10 out of 10 yet but we're

[1589.76 - 1594.08] doing we're doing much better um yeah so

[1592.72 - 1595.919] i think that i think that this fine

[1594.08 - 1597.36] tuning data set i'm really on to

[1595.919 - 1600.0800000000002] something and i think that there's a lot

[1597.36 - 1602.0] more uh a lot more that i can i can do

[1600.08 - 1604.72] with this um i'll need to think about

[1602.0 - 1606.159] some more edge edge case scenarios like

[1604.72 - 1608.72] you know what if it's a special needs

[1606.159 - 1610.159] kid or sensory processing or or whatever

[1608.72 - 1612.32] i really need to talk to some of my

[1610.159 - 1613.8400000000001] teacher friends and probably my

[1612.32 - 1616.0] girlfriend some more because she has all

[1613.84 - 1617.9189999999999] kinds of great stories from the library

[1616.0 - 1619.6] anyways i'm rambling i think you guys

[1617.919 - 1622.72] get the point i will talk to you all

[1619.6 - 1622.7199999999998] next time
