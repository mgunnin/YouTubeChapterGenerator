[0.0 - 5.819] there are exactly four reasons why

[3.12 - 8.099] machines will replace all human labor or

[5.819 - 11.58] at least almost all human labor those

[8.099 - 14.82] reasons are better faster cheaper and

[11.58 - 16.92] safer let's get right into it the first

[14.82 - 18.779] thing that you need to think of is in

[16.92 - 21.42] the Second Industrial Revolution where

[18.779 - 23.82] we introduced machines into

[21.42 - 26.82] industrialized agriculture we replaced

[23.82 - 29.76] the ox why did we replace the oxen with

[26.82 - 31.679000000000002] tractors number one the ox are more

[29.76 - 33.54] efficient machines took over because

[31.679 - 35.76] machines don't need rest they do break

[33.54 - 37.86] down sometimes but they don't take any

[35.76 - 40.079] time to grow they don't get old they

[37.86 - 42.379] don't get sick and die they do it like I

[40.079 - 44.34] said they do break they can be faster

[42.379 - 47.218999999999994] machines do not have the same

[44.34 - 51.42] constraints as biological uh draft

[47.219 - 54.0] animals now the cost as well machines

[51.42 - 55.86] are initially more expensive than

[54.0 - 57.84] animals because you know animals

[55.86 - 61.079] reproduce and all they need is a little

[57.84 - 64.68] bit of grain but in the long run because

[61.079 - 66.659] of all the various benefits to them they

[64.68 - 68.7] end up being much cheaper especially

[66.659 - 70.43900000000001] with the amount of product productivity

[68.7 - 72.36] output they have and then finally

[70.439 - 74.69999999999999] they're they're actually safer

[72.36 - 76.08] because animals one they have zoonotic

[74.7 - 78.43900000000001] diseases they can have unpredictable

[76.08 - 82.79899999999999] behaviors but also

[78.439 - 85.13999999999999] machines can get humans away from the

[82.799 - 87.06] work uh you think about a combine today

[85.14 - 90.06] where you're in a nice safe clean

[87.06 - 93.0] air-conditioned cab uh they're just

[90.06 - 95.759] going to be much safer overall and this

[93.0 - 97.799] is true for pretty much uh many many

[95.759 - 100.14] machines especially as they get larger

[97.799 - 102.47900000000001] with more safety features built in and

[100.14 - 105.24] then finally scalability you can Mass

[102.479 - 107.82] produce tractors you cannot Mass produce

[105.24 - 110.03999999999999] oxen so with this analogy in mind let's

[107.82 - 111.29899999999999] dive right into the rest of it better

[110.04 - 115.43900000000001] than us

[111.299 - 117.18] so one example is open ai's whisper so

[115.439 - 119.939] open ai's whisper if you're not familiar

[117.18 - 122.7] with it is a transcription AI service

[119.939 - 125.39899999999999] that has been proven to be better than

[122.7 - 128.099] human level transcription uh whether

[125.399 - 131.099] it's in multiple languages or noisy

[128.099 - 132.23899999999998] environments or otherwise low quality

[131.099 - 136.56] audio

[132.239 - 139.379] The Whisper AI is an example of AI being

[136.56 - 141.0] better than all human performance and

[139.379 - 143.819] what I mean by better than all human

[141.0 - 147.18] performance it outperforms literally

[143.819 - 149.51999999999998] like any 10 people and so this is just

[147.18 - 153.0] the first of a trend of many things in

[149.52 - 156.42000000000002] where in which AI is going to not just

[153.0 - 160.92] match human capacity but surpass human

[156.42 - 163.67999999999998] capacity uh like by a mile and so it's

[160.92 - 165.29999999999998] more accurate it's faster it scales it

[163.68 - 167.09900000000002] has availability and finally it's

[165.3 - 168.54000000000002] infinitely cheaper than human

[167.099 - 171.11999999999998] transcribers

[168.54 - 172.79999999999998] and so when you look at just this the

[171.12 - 175.26] fact that the first AI product that

[172.8 - 179.459] exists that is unequivocally better than

[175.26 - 181.56] all humans All Humans combined uh then

[179.459 - 183.72] you you extrapolate this out and say

[181.56 - 185.58] okay which is the next tool that's going

[183.72 - 186.72] to be better than all humans can

[185.58 - 189.18] possibly be

[186.72 - 191.04] faster than us so the example that I'm

[189.18 - 192.48000000000002] going to use here is Claude Claude has a

[191.04 - 194.57999999999998] hundred thousand token window which is

[192.48 - 195.78] about 60 to 80 000 words depending on

[194.58 - 198.54000000000002] how much formatting and what language

[195.78 - 201.12] it's in but it can read that entire

[198.54 - 205.44] volume of text in about 30 seconds

[201.12 - 207.3] uh that is obviously and Way Way Beyond

[205.44 - 210.06] any human capacity

[207.3 - 211.8] so this is and it's not just you know at

[210.06 - 213.84] human speed or twice the human speed

[211.8 - 216.48000000000002] this is literally hundreds if not

[213.84 - 218.64000000000001] thousands of times faster than humans

[216.48 - 220.44] and so between the reading speed the

[218.64 - 223.79899999999998] ability to then not just not just read

[220.44 - 225.12] that fast but also synthesize uh not

[223.799 - 227.58] quite as fast but still it can

[225.12 - 230.459] synthesize much faster and generate

[227.58 - 233.70000000000002] content uh then you combine it with the

[230.459 - 236.64000000000001] availability the low cost again it's

[233.7 - 239.7] better and faster in many ways it's a

[236.64 - 243.05999999999997] Claude as a chat bot is not better than

[239.7 - 244.5] uh than humans in all ways but when you

[243.06 - 246.239] when you have something that is this

[244.5 - 248.099] much faster it still adds a tremendous

[246.239 - 249.78] amount of value so imagine in the future

[248.099 - 252.599] when things are both better and faster

[249.78 - 255.12] and that's that future is coming quickly

[252.599 - 258.0] it's cheaper than us so I had a story

[255.12 - 260.579] from a client where they started using a

[258.0 - 263.22] code interpreter with chat GPT and they

[260.579 - 265.34000000000003] realized that it was doing uh as much

[263.22 - 267.44000000000005] work if not more than a full-time

[265.34 - 269.4] biostatistician so your full-time

[267.44 - 271.56] biostatistician might cost between five

[269.4 - 273.12] and ten thousand dollars a month uh

[271.56 - 275.52] depending on you know region and level

[273.12 - 278.04] of experience but chat GPT with code

[275.52 - 283.19899999999996] interpreter costs 20 a month so that is

[278.04 - 285.0] about a 400x in terms of saving uh so as

[283.199 - 287.1] you adopt these generative AI tools

[285.0 - 289.08] you're going to see immediate cost

[287.1 - 291.06] savings as well as new capabilities

[289.08 - 292.62] because maybe you didn't have a bio

[291.06 - 295.199] statistician and you needed one or

[292.62 - 297.6] whatever else uh chat GPT with code

[295.199 - 299.52000000000004] interpreter can do so this is going to

[297.6 - 301.139] increase your operational efficiency

[299.52 - 303.53999999999996] because again it can operate Around the

[301.139 - 306.06] Clock it's an it's uh incredibly

[303.54 - 309.0] scalable because this is just one person

[306.06 - 310.5] using uh chat gbt but if everyone in

[309.0 - 313.259] your organization is using something

[310.5 - 316.74] like chat GPT then everyone basically

[313.259 - 319.1] has a cast of full-time employees worth

[316.74 - 321.72] of Labor working under them

[319.1 - 323.699] the reduction in cost means that

[321.72 - 325.199] companies can then allocate the money

[323.699 - 328.86] that would have gone to those salaries

[325.199 - 330.36] elsewhere and the most important the

[328.86 - 331.62] Competitive Edge that this gives you if

[330.36 - 333.66] you're not doing this then your

[331.62 - 336.419] competitors are and so what we're going

[333.66 - 339.02000000000004] to see is as generative AI drives down

[336.419 - 341.28] the cost of a lot of goods and services

[339.02 - 343.15999999999997] you're going to fold because you're just

[341.28 - 346.79999999999995] not going to be able to keep up

[343.16 - 349.68] uh safer than us so this is uh data as

[346.8 - 353.039] recently as March of this year uh waymo

[349.68 - 355.919] reports uh 0.59 accidents per million

[353.039 - 357.71999999999997] miles uh which is compared to just shy

[355.919 - 360.419] of three accidents per million miles for

[357.72 - 363.06] human drivers so it's already uh

[360.419 - 367.19899999999996] self-driving cars are already several uh

[363.06 - 369.18] times safer than human drivers and so uh

[367.199 - 371.759] reduced accident rates live saved

[369.18 - 374.28000000000003] accidents uh and cost avoidance risk

[371.759 - 376.5] mitigation and this is just where it is

[374.28 - 378.11999999999995] today this is not including ongoing

[376.5 - 381.12] improvements as the Technologies get

[378.12 - 382.86] better so here are four examples of

[381.12 - 385.919] machines that are better cheaper faster

[382.86 - 387.72] and safer than us and we're just at the

[385.919 - 390.06] beginning of the generative AI

[387.72 - 391.97900000000004] Revolution the writing is on the wall as

[390.06 - 393.84] far as I'm concerned machines are going

[391.979 - 396.84] to can you continue to get better faster

[393.84 - 399.29999999999995] cheaper and safer and rather than just

[396.84 - 401.46] adopting one or two of these most

[399.3 - 403.259] machines are going to start having all

[401.46 - 405.78] four of these criteria

[403.259 - 409.62] now you've probably heard the you know

[405.78 - 411.17999999999995] human in the loop this is a myopic view

[409.62 - 414.06] um and as far as I can tell the reason

[411.18 - 416.40000000000003] that people like uh CEOs such as Sam

[414.06 - 418.62] Altman and others keep saying this is

[416.4 - 421.56] mostly it is just to placate people from

[418.62 - 423.0] panicking but when you look at the when

[421.56 - 425.18] you look at the trends that machines are

[423.0 - 427.8] becoming better faster cheaper and safer

[425.18 - 430.919] uh there's no reason to hire people

[427.8 - 433.44] anymore uh in fact if machine if and

[430.919 - 435.29999999999995] when machines surpass humans on these

[433.44 - 437.94] four criteria better faster cheaper and

[435.3 - 441.18] safer it would be unethical to have

[437.94 - 443.94] humans doing some jobs for instance once

[441.18 - 446.58] truck uh once uh once all driving uh

[443.94 - 449.46] cars trucks taxi buses once all driving

[446.58 - 452.34] is done safer by a machine it would

[449.46 - 454.919] actually probably be illegal or should

[452.34 - 456.9] be illegal for humans to drive because

[454.919 - 459.12] if machines are a hundred times safer

[456.9 - 462.84] than human drivers you wouldn't allow

[459.12 - 465.3] people to do that likewise if uh you

[462.84 - 468.29999999999995] know AI powered hospitals and robots and

[465.3 - 470.099] and robot doctors achieve you know

[468.3 - 471.90000000000003] better results 10 times better results

[470.099 - 474.24] than human doctors and Physicians and

[471.9 - 476.099] surgeons you wouldn't want to be treated

[474.24 - 478.38] by a human anymore

[476.099 - 480.71999999999997] and so this is one thing that I want to

[478.38 - 482.699] point out is that as machines become

[480.72 - 484.97900000000004] better faster cheaper and safer than

[482.699 - 486.66] humans it is not ethical to uh keep

[484.979 - 488.34] humans in the loop

[486.66 - 491.34000000000003] um not the least of which next is

[488.34 - 493.08] inefficiency by insisting on keeping

[491.34 - 496.85999999999996] humans in the loop you are creating

[493.08 - 498.35999999999996] unnecessary bottlenecks uh not only are

[496.86 - 500.099] not only that you're artificially

[498.36 - 502.139] inflating the cost of goods and services

[500.099 - 503.759] what we should be doing instead is

[502.139 - 506.22] working on getting humans out of the

[503.759 - 509.58000000000004] loop so that these these high-speed

[506.22 - 512.88] low-cost high efficiency machines can do

[509.58 - 515.3389999999999] more labor without human constraints and

[512.88 - 517.38] then again with safety concerns and

[515.339 - 518.82] competitive disadvantages if your

[517.38 - 520.62] competitors are doing it if your

[518.82 - 522.779] competitors are are reaching for AI

[520.62 - 524.82] tools that are better faster cheaper and

[522.779 - 526.14] safer and you're not guess who's going

[524.82 - 529.0400000000001] to be in business this time next year

[526.14 - 531.959] and guess who isn't so this is my Spiel

[529.04 - 534.18] better faster cheaper safer I hope you

[531.959 - 535.8599999999999] like this video nice and short and sweet

[534.18 - 538.64] and to the point have a good one thanks

[535.86 - 538.64] for watching
