[0.0 - 6.299] good morning everybody David Shapiro

[2.04 - 8.4] here uh so in the last 24 hours we have

[6.299 - 12.120000000000001] seen several interesting pieces of news

[8.4 - 13.86] drop open AI Tesla and IBM are all

[12.12 - 15.479999999999999] throwing around numbers in the millions

[13.86 - 17.88] and billions and this is in terms of

[15.48 - 19.619] valuation revenue and investment so

[17.88 - 23.52] let's get right into it

[19.619 - 25.98] uh first up IBM has invested even more

[23.52 - 27.599] into hugging face so they have been

[25.98 - 29.699] involved with hugging face for instance

[27.599 - 33.0] they're collaborating on walks of Watson

[29.699 - 35.46] X however they just closed a series D

[33.0 - 39.239] funding round for 235 million dollars

[35.46 - 41.76] valuing hugging face at 4.5 billion

[39.239 - 43.32] dollars so this is a startup that

[41.76 - 46.32] produces

[43.32 - 48.3] primarily open source Ai and has only

[46.32 - 50.76] been around for what two years I think

[48.3 - 52.44] maybe three at least that's as long as

[50.76 - 54.239] like I've kind of known about them as as

[52.44 - 58.44] long as they've been on my radar

[54.239 - 61.559] now at the same time uh the CEO of IBM

[58.44 - 63.599999999999994] arvind Krishna has frozen thousands and

[61.559 - 66.42] thousands of jobs there's 3 900 more

[63.6 - 69.299] layoffs planned at IBM with 7 800

[66.42 - 71.04] positions Frozen and this is also

[69.299 - 73.86000000000001] someone who has said that he expects 30

[71.04 - 77.22] to 50 percent of repetitive tasks to be

[73.86 - 79.439] taken by Ai and that also uh that those

[77.22 - 83.15899999999999] back office tasks will probably be done

[79.439 - 85.55999999999999] better by AI so better faster cheaper uh

[83.159 - 87.72] in other words the takeaway IBM is

[85.56 - 91.259] doubling down on AI

[87.72 - 93.78] uh at the uh next up is Tesla so Tesla

[91.259 - 96.42] just fired up their uh high performance

[93.78 - 98.4] Computing cluster it's 300 worth 300

[96.42 - 102.9] million dollars and it is built of 10

[98.4 - 104.88000000000001] 000 in video Nvidia h100 uh gpus uh so

[102.9 - 107.46000000000001] this is primarily going to be used to

[104.88 - 110.579] take on uh general purpose uh HPC

[107.46 - 112.91999999999999] workloads so this is an HPC compute

[110.579 - 115.32] cluster which basically means that it is

[112.92 - 118.68] a high performance tensor cores that you

[115.32 - 120.41999999999999] can use for anything now obviously Tesla

[118.68 - 123.78] they do a lot of AI but their their

[120.42 - 127.43900000000001] Flagship AI product is FSD which is full

[123.78 - 129.3] self driving uh Elon uh also said that

[127.439 - 131.879] they are going to invest four billion

[129.3 - 133.31900000000002] more dollars into AI over the next two

[131.879 - 135.84] years including at least a billion

[133.319 - 137.22] dollars into their Dojo supercomputer

[135.84 - 140.16] which is their primary training computer

[137.22 - 142.739] so again we see Tech Giants doubling

[140.16 - 145.98] down on AI with numbers in the hundreds

[142.739 - 149.70000000000002] of millions and billions of dollars

[145.98 - 152.819] and the uh kind of the the coup de grace

[149.7 - 156.42] of yesterday's news is that open ai's

[152.819 - 159.06] Revenue has exploded so last year they

[156.42 - 160.92] made 28 million dollars in revenue and

[159.06 - 163.44] in the next 12 months they're on track

[160.92 - 166.319] to make a billion dollars in Revenue

[163.44 - 168.599] uh their revenue has obviously exploded

[166.319 - 170.39999999999998] primarily due to chat GPT and having

[168.599 - 172.44] more than 100 million users sign up in

[170.4 - 174.84] two months but one thing that you need

[172.44 - 177.18] to keep in mind is that this is a 35x

[174.84 - 179.58] increase in Revenue growth so this is

[177.18 - 182.459] where uh tech companies really aim for

[179.58 - 184.31900000000002] to be like a true uh unicorn

[182.459 - 186.959] um so the the technical definition of

[184.319 - 189.0] unicorn is any tech company that any

[186.959 - 191.879] Tech startup that gets to a billion

[189.0 - 193.739] dollar valuation but what the next phase

[191.879 - 196.2] that you're looking for is for them to

[193.739 - 197.34] to take off exponentially so this is the

[196.2 - 199.07999999999998] nature of the book exponential

[197.34 - 201.42000000000002] organizations which I bought but I

[199.08 - 203.94000000000003] haven't fully read yet uh anyways the

[201.42 - 206.7] idea is that because of the nature of

[203.94 - 208.26] Technology because user adoption can be

[206.7 - 210.73899999999998] that fast because you can immediately

[208.26 - 213.659] have Global exposure once your product

[210.739 - 216.659] uh hits the market that's how you can

[213.659 - 218.57999999999998] have 35x Revenue growth in Tech and in

[216.659 - 221.39999999999998] literally no other industry because in

[218.58 - 223.799] in most other Industries where there is

[221.4 - 225.54] human labor involved and when there as

[223.799 - 228.42000000000002] physical goods and locations involved

[225.54 - 230.7] it's just not possible to grow that fast

[228.42 - 233.7] uh one part of the reports out there

[230.7 - 236.33999999999997] says that uh the chat GPT costs them

[233.7 - 239.04] seven hundred thousand dollars per day

[236.34 - 240.42000000000002] to run and if you do the math I did some

[239.04 - 241.98] some quick back of the napkin

[240.42 - 245.879] calculations

[241.98 - 247.98] um if if chat GPT costs 700 000 a day to

[245.879 - 250.2] run then you add it all up and you look

[247.98 - 252.92] at a billion dollars Revenue it probably

[250.2 - 255.78] costs Chad gbt at current rates about

[252.92 - 258.84] 250 to 300 million dollars per year to

[255.78 - 260.82] run so if they're if their revenue is 1

[258.84 - 262.979] billion but the outflows just from

[260.82 - 265.08] running chat GPT which again right now

[262.979 - 266.699] is their Flagship product

[265.08 - 268.8] um then that means they still have 700

[266.699 - 272.22] million dollars left over for things

[268.8 - 274.44] like uh employee revenue or employee

[272.22 - 275.759] salaries research that sort of stuff now

[274.44 - 278.88] another thing to make this more

[275.759 - 281.58000000000004] complicated is that because of the deal

[278.88 - 282.56] that openai signed with Microsoft

[281.58 - 284.699] um I

[282.56 - 287.639] obviously like I haven't read the the

[284.699 - 289.32] entire full package of their deal but my

[287.639 - 291.36] understanding is that Microsoft is

[289.32 - 294.06] entitled to up to 75 percent of open

[291.36 - 295.259] ai's Revenue until they reached a

[294.06 - 299.16] threshold and I think that that

[295.259 - 302.22] threshold is until openai earns them a

[299.16 - 303.72] hundred billion dollars so originally as

[302.22 - 305.46000000000004] of last year it they thought that it

[303.72 - 308.699] could take a decade or more to pay it

[305.46 - 311.28] off now given this recent news and the

[308.699 - 313.259] explosion uh maybe that time frame will

[311.28 - 314.58] shorten now obviously a billion dollars

[313.259 - 316.44] in Revenue if they're giving less than

[314.58 - 321.35999999999996] that to Microsoft that's still going to

[316.44 - 323.34] be like 100 years so if their revenue uh

[321.36 - 325.08000000000004] increases to 10 billion a year or

[323.34 - 326.82] something like that then they'll be able

[325.08 - 329.09999999999997] to pay it off even faster again I'm not

[326.82 - 331.52] sure of all the all the full terms but

[329.1 - 334.68] my point here is that Microsoft is

[331.52 - 335.75899999999996] benefiting from their investment now I

[334.68 - 338.40000000000003] don't know if the whole thing is Cash

[335.759 - 340.22] positive open AI might still be losing

[338.4 - 342.479] money they certainly were last year

[340.22 - 344.58000000000004] Microsoft might still be losing money on

[342.479 - 346.56] the deal but what they're doing is these

[344.58 - 348.0] are strategic moves that the companies

[346.56 - 352.32] are doing in order to better position

[348.0 - 354.72] themselves as these Technologies ramp up

[352.32 - 357.12] okay so that's the three pieces of news

[354.72 - 360.78000000000003] let's dive into the analysis

[357.12 - 364.139] first is uh data and metrics and

[360.78 - 366.35999999999996] predictions on investment growth so when

[364.139 - 369.24] you see numbers like this you know 235

[366.36 - 372.78000000000003] million 300 million uh a billion dollars

[369.24 - 374.22] that is really interesting because this

[372.78 - 375.65999999999997] is kind of I'm not going to say it's the

[374.22 - 377.94000000000005] first time we're seeing numbers this big

[375.66 - 380.36] but we're certainly seeing numbers this

[377.94 - 384.78] big uh in much shorter periods of time

[380.36 - 387.18] and so this uh made me like look into

[384.78 - 389.46] like okay what did what did the

[387.18 - 391.139] financial analysts predict and it looks

[389.46 - 393.71999999999997] like we're actually kind of on track so

[391.139 - 396.06] yes these are like exciting numbers but

[393.72 - 398.759] Goldman Sachs forecasted last year that

[396.06 - 401.16] by 2025 we should be seeing 200 billion

[398.759 - 404.1] dollars per year in these kinds of AI

[401.16 - 405.53900000000004] Investments uh which is double what it

[404.1 - 408.18] was more than double what it was last

[405.539 - 410.699] year of 92 billion uh there is some

[408.18 - 412.08] evidence that that 2023 might be seeing

[410.699 - 413.40000000000003] a Slowdown

[412.08 - 414.9] um but there's also some evidence that

[413.4 - 416.94] it might be accelerating so we're not

[414.9 - 419.4] really going to know until the year is

[416.94 - 421.919] oh over and we've had a chance to tally

[419.4 - 424.31899999999996] it all up but right now the general

[421.919 - 427.31899999999996] consensus seems to be that things are

[424.319 - 429.53900000000004] chugging along more or less as expected

[427.319 - 431.1] so keep that nut keep these numbers in

[429.539 - 433.139] mind that like yes the growth is

[431.1 - 436.639] explosive here so it's a really good

[433.139 - 439.56] time to be selling AI uh Goods Services

[436.639 - 441.3] Hardware software that sort of stuff

[439.56 - 443.699] because the investment is coming the

[441.3 - 445.62] investment is growing and so what all

[443.699 - 448.74] these moves that we're seeing are just

[445.62 - 451.74] naturally to be expected because if we

[448.74 - 453.539] go from 66 billion to 92 billion one

[451.74 - 456.419] year and then we go from 92 billion to

[453.539 - 458.58] let's say 120 billion this year

[456.419 - 460.68] that's 30 billion more dollars that's

[458.58 - 462.419] going to be thrown around on top of what

[460.68 - 464.58] was thrown around last year

[462.419 - 466.79999999999995] so the investment is happening we're

[464.58 - 468.24] seeing this exponential ramp up I guess

[466.8 - 470.52000000000004] this is more of a geometric ramp up

[468.24 - 472.74] rather adding about 30 billion dollars

[470.52 - 475.979] per year of investment

[472.74 - 477.78000000000003] um to to uh AI resources so we're seeing

[475.979 - 479.34] this geometric ramp up

[477.78 - 480.65999999999997] um but we're not talking in the millions

[479.34 - 482.46] of dollars we're talking in the billions

[480.66 - 484.8] and very soon hundreds of billions of

[482.46 - 487.25899999999996] dollars which means that any problems

[484.8 - 489.18] that AI has are going to be solved and

[487.259 - 492.0] this goes back to my video a few weeks

[489.18 - 494.40000000000003] ago AI winter is not coming this is more

[492.0 - 497.28] evidence that AI winter is not coming so

[494.4 - 499.37899999999996] do not think about AI as it is today

[497.28 - 501.29999999999995] think about AI as it will be a year from

[499.379 - 503.699] now because remember this time last year

[501.3 - 505.319] none of you knew well I'm not going to

[503.699 - 507.479] say none of you some of some of my

[505.319 - 509.879] longtime fans will remember when it was

[507.479 - 513.36] just gpt3 because that's all we have

[509.879 - 515.94] this time last year uh but then uh you

[513.36 - 518.099] know come November chat GPT came out and

[515.94 - 520.32] everything changed so imagine where

[518.099 - 523.74] we're going to be this time next year

[520.32 - 525.0] now on top of investment you know I'm

[523.74 - 526.6800000000001] always I'm one of the ones that's always

[525.0 - 528.899] beating the drum on you know post labor

[526.68 - 531.959] economics and you know utopian future

[528.899 - 534.72] where nobody has to work so I decided to

[531.959 - 536.459] put my money or numbers rather where my

[534.72 - 538.5600000000001] mouth is and I looked it up

[536.459 - 539.66] so I use perplexity to find all kinds of

[538.56 - 543.0] Statistics

[539.66 - 546.779] from various dimensions and angles and

[543.0 - 549.779] so yes there have been 150 000 or more

[546.779 - 552.36] U.S tech layoffs as of June so that's

[549.779 - 555.06] that's excluding July and now August so

[552.36 - 556.62] there's two more months however the

[555.06 - 559.1999999999999] recent data shows that total

[556.62 - 561.779] unemployment in America remains at a

[559.2 - 566.0400000000001] relatively low 3.5 percent

[561.779 - 568.86] uh there was 375 000 tech jobs open uh

[566.04 - 571.019] as of January this year obviously that's

[568.86 - 573.48] probably changed a little bit uh

[571.019 - 576.36] forecasts uh at uh at the same time

[573.48 - 579.48] showed that they were expecting 272 000

[576.36 - 581.7] more new tech jobs by the end of 2023.

[579.48 - 584.04] so that remains to be seen those last

[581.7 - 585.5400000000001] two sources were not government sources

[584.04 - 587.8199999999999] um those were like from zip recruiter

[585.54 - 590.2199999999999] and stuff like that so take those with a

[587.82 - 591.9590000000001] grain of salt but the layoffs that was

[590.22 - 593.76] government data so that's that's pretty

[591.959 - 597.0] reliable data

[593.76 - 600.42] uh some other non-governmental sources

[597.0 - 603.839] uh said that AI is expected to uh to

[600.42 - 606.54] destroy 85 million jobs globally by 2025

[603.839 - 609.24] but is expected to create up to 97

[606.54 - 611.5999999999999] million jobs globally by 2025 so that

[609.24 - 614.279] would be a net gain of 12 million jobs

[611.6 - 617.339] and so when you see the layoffs and new

[614.279 - 619.32] jobs that are going unfulfilled uh

[617.339 - 621.899] there's a trend emerging here which is

[619.32 - 624.839] that old jobs are going away and new

[621.899 - 626.399] jobs are being created again many of

[624.839 - 627.899] these sources are not government a lot

[626.399 - 630.839] of them are speculation and forecasting

[627.899 - 633.839] so take it with a grain of salt but the

[630.839 - 634.9200000000001] pattern to me seems relatively clear and

[633.839 - 636.72] that is that we are going through a

[634.92 - 639.54] Workforce transformation so it is time

[636.72 - 642.36] to skill up uh another piece of evidence

[639.54 - 645.24] in this puzzle is that generative AI job

[642.36 - 647.04] postings jumped 20 in May alone or maybe

[645.24 - 648.66] that was year over year I don't remember

[647.04 - 651.42] uh anyways

[648.66 - 654.36] you know so post-labor economics not

[651.42 - 656.88] here yet but uh there is evidence that

[654.36 - 658.8000000000001] you need to be pivoting to uh generative

[656.88 - 660.779] AI skills and tools so if you're not

[658.8 - 664.38] you're going to get further and further

[660.779 - 665.76] behind uh now this this slide was

[664.38 - 667.8] actually the most interesting thing to

[665.76 - 669.66] me because you know I talked to some of

[667.8 - 671.88] my fellow communicators and YouTubers

[669.66 - 674.519] and researchers I talk to people all

[671.88 - 676.14] over the world and so if you talk to

[674.519 - 678.18] individuals and figure out what their

[676.14 - 679.98] concerns are you know like government

[678.18 - 681.54] policy makers trying to get you know

[679.98 - 684.54] other people in the government on board

[681.54 - 687.24] with AI or uh Business Leaders trying to

[684.54 - 690.24] figure out how to adopt AI uh the

[687.24 - 693.0600000000001] numbers of public sentiment were

[690.24 - 695.82] actually more where I was hoping they

[693.06 - 697.7399999999999] would be which kind of invalidated some

[695.82 - 699.48] of the work that I've done but hey this

[697.74 - 701.7] is a good place for me to be wrong so

[699.48 - 704.7] let me dive into the data a Reuters

[701.7 - 707.4590000000001] ipsis poll recently showed that 61 of

[704.7 - 709.98] Americans view AI as a Potential Threat

[707.459 - 711.92] to human civilization that is a huge

[709.98 - 715.38] that is almost a super majority already

[711.92 - 716.459] of Americans that say yes AI could wipe

[715.38 - 719.1] us all out

[716.459 - 721.14] so thanks to James Cameron and the

[719.1 - 724.8000000000001] Matrix and and all that other you know

[721.14 - 726.54] every story out there we have a schema

[724.8 - 728.579] those those fictional stories have done

[726.54 - 732.7199999999999] their job to prepare us for the

[728.579 - 734.88] potential dangers of AI uh the next

[732.72 - 737.279] piece of information is that a Pew

[734.88 - 738.899] research poll showed that 58 of

[737.279 - 741.54] Americans are more concerned than

[738.899 - 744.12] excited about the rise of AI in daily

[741.54 - 746.0999999999999] life so again there's a little bit of

[744.12 - 748.5] anxiety and consternation rather than

[746.1 - 750.36] just raw excitement so I'm not saying

[748.5 - 752.519] that like the doomers are winning I'm

[750.36 - 755.7] just saying that like there's people are

[752.519 - 757.5600000000001] are cautious uh and then this one was

[755.7 - 760.26] Far and Away the most interesting which

[757.56 - 761.9399999999999] was an economist and you gov poll showed

[760.26 - 764.16] that about 75 percent of Americans

[761.94 - 766.62] believe that AI should be regulated or

[764.16 - 770.04] heavily regulated by the government that

[766.62 - 773.279] 79 percent Democrat and 73 Republicans

[770.04 - 776.88] we rarely ever see this much consensus

[773.279 - 777.74] on anything in America but when you you

[776.88 - 781.26] have

[777.74 - 783.36] either a majority near super majority or

[781.26 - 785.399] above super majority of Americans

[783.36 - 788.339] agreeing on something the political

[785.399 - 790.92] willpower is there so this gives me a

[788.339 - 793.3800000000001] tremendous amount of confidence that

[790.92 - 795.66] regulations are going to happen that

[793.38 - 797.88] people are taking it seriously and that

[795.66 - 799.68] this will help steer the ship in the

[797.88 - 801.8389999999999] right direction so I wanted to share

[799.68 - 804.18] this information with you because to me

[801.839 - 805.3800000000001] it gave me a lot of confidence that

[804.18 - 808.56] we're heading in the right direction all

[805.38 - 811.62] right so some conclusions and takeaways

[808.56 - 813.42] here's my predictions uh AI investment

[811.62 - 814.8] May cool slightly and I don't mean that

[813.42 - 816.7199999999999] it's going to go down I just mean it's

[814.8 - 818.0999999999999] going to slow down so it's not going to

[816.72 - 820.44] go negative it's just it's not going to

[818.1 - 823.44] be quite as hot as it has been and my

[820.44 - 825.8000000000001] interpretation is that the several class

[823.44 - 828.0] action lawsuits filed against open AI

[825.8 - 829.38] have kind of spooked the markets and

[828.0 - 832.5] maybe made people a little bit more

[829.38 - 834.6] tepid about jumping in now that being

[832.5 - 837.32] said we just did see you know a lot of

[834.6 - 839.519] investment yesterday so we'll see

[837.32 - 841.019] Meta has been taking an entirely

[839.519 - 843.24] different approach to AI where they're

[841.019 - 845.579] just doing everything open source

[843.24 - 846.54] it's a bold strategy we'll see how it

[845.579 - 849.12] plays out

[846.54 - 851.519] uh so stay tuned on the space of closed

[849.12 - 853.019] Source versus open source personally I

[851.519 - 854.399] think that open source is the way just

[853.019 - 855.779] because it's going to have less friction

[854.399 - 858.0] and it's going to have more

[855.779 - 859.62] collaboration which means that any AI

[858.0 - 861.72] built on open source data and open

[859.62 - 863.399] source models are probably just going to

[861.72 - 865.26] be better not the least of which they're

[863.399 - 868.92] going to be more democratic that's my

[865.26 - 871.019] hope uh let's see number two Americans

[868.92 - 874.079] are largely United on regulations and

[871.019 - 876.779] fears but regulatory capture is still a

[874.079 - 879.0] primary concern with regulation comes

[876.779 - 881.82] risk because if you regulate it

[879.0 - 882.899] incorrectly if you listen to the wrong

[881.82 - 886.0790000000001] people when you're coming up with

[882.899 - 887.699] regulations uh then you know every every

[886.079 - 890.3389999999999] stakeholder is going to try and stack

[887.699 - 891.959] the regulations in their favor so

[890.339 - 893.6990000000001] stacking the deck in their favor whether

[891.959 - 896.399] it's big companies whether it's

[893.699 - 898.079] governments uh or whoever whatever other

[896.399 - 899.22] special interests or lobbyists are out

[898.079 - 901.1389999999999] there

[899.22 - 903.48] um that's that's the primary concern now

[901.139 - 906.12] the amount of attention that Americans

[903.48 - 908.4590000000001] are putting on AI I think means that

[906.12 - 910.5600000000001] that that's gonna we're gonna demand

[908.459 - 913.079] transparency and we're going to demand

[910.56 - 914.04] accountability so my hope is that this

[913.079 - 916.019] is something that we're going to do

[914.04 - 917.639] right and probably what I'll do is

[916.019 - 920.22] because there's so much consensus on

[917.639 - 922.98] this I'll do a follow-up video on how do

[920.22 - 925.62] we do AI regulation correctly so that we

[922.98 - 928.26] don't end up with regulatory capture

[925.62 - 931.139] uh and finally the state of jobs right

[928.26 - 933.24] now seems really good so uh you know

[931.139 - 935.22] post labor economics and Ubi are going

[933.24 - 936.779] to have to wait for a while like I said

[935.22 - 938.5790000000001] in a previous video where I introduced

[936.779 - 940.4399999999999] these Concepts there's a few signals

[938.579 - 942.899] that we can pay attention to such as

[940.44 - 943.9200000000001] deflation jobs loss and a few other

[942.899 - 945.24] things

[943.92 - 947.3] um we're still in a state of inflation

[945.24 - 949.98] and we're still in a state of low

[947.3 - 953.0999999999999] unemployment so post-labor economics

[949.98 - 954.72] it's on the horizon will it but it also

[953.1 - 956.76] remains to be seen because again I could

[954.72 - 957.779] be completely wrong in reading the tea

[956.76 - 959.8199999999999] leaves

[957.779 - 961.68] um now that being said there are many

[959.82 - 965.279] industries that are actively being

[961.68 - 968.0999999999999] disrupted by uh by Tech if you look on

[965.279 - 970.4399999999999] on Reddit across many different domains

[968.1 - 972.3000000000001] tech jobs are being disrupted marketing

[970.44 - 973.32] jobs translation jobs that was an

[972.3 - 975.0] interesting one that I just saw

[973.32 - 976.8000000000001] yesterday where someone was talking

[975.0 - 978.66] about uh people in the translation

[976.8 - 980.779] industry are just expecting to be pretty

[978.66 - 982.4399999999999] much out of work by this time next year

[980.779 - 986.82] copywriting has already been under

[982.44 - 989.1] threat and so what I'm curious is as AI

[986.82 - 991.6800000000001] destroys like pretty much entire

[989.1 - 993.3000000000001] segments of the of the labor market

[991.68 - 995.399] are we going to see a commensurate

[993.3 - 997.3199999999999] number of new jobs popping up elsewhere

[995.399 - 999.6] I don't know that that's the case and

[997.32 - 1001.88] because it's difficult to see on

[999.6 - 1003.98] aggregate how many jobs have been lost

[1001.88 - 1006.38] to AI versus created

[1003.98 - 1007.88] all we have is base all we have to go on

[1006.38 - 1010.16] is basically total employment numbers

[1007.88 - 1011.8389999999999] and total unemployment rates

[1010.16 - 1015.62] okay so what are the two primary

[1011.839 - 1017.12] takeaways number one skill up uh we are

[1015.62 - 1018.8] actively

[1017.12 - 1020.48] um in a state of job market

[1018.8 - 1022.579] transformation

[1020.48 - 1024.439] um so this is something where I actually

[1022.579 - 1027.98] can help you out

[1024.439 - 1031.16] um I have a consultation I do uh whether

[1027.98 - 1033.02] it's training product design whatever uh

[1031.16 - 1034.28] I do it all remotely I don't do it in

[1033.02 - 1036.26] person just because traveling is too

[1034.28 - 1039.02] difficult for me but this whole phase

[1036.26 - 1041.66] reminds me of the early 2000s with the

[1039.02 - 1044.72] rise of Microsoft and it and developer

[1041.66 - 1047.3600000000001] certifications uh it was all the rage

[1044.72 - 1048.919] and there was literally ad like lots of

[1047.36 - 1050.8999999999999] advertisements saying like there are

[1048.919 - 1052.3400000000001] sixty thousand unfilled IT jobs you know

[1050.9 - 1055.1000000000001] get training now and that's actually how

[1052.34 - 1056.6599999999999] I picked my career was because at the

[1055.1 - 1058.82] time I was like okay well I need a job

[1056.66 - 1060.799] I'm good at technology and there's unmet

[1058.82 - 1063.4399999999998] demand so I think we're about to see the

[1060.799 - 1067.6399999999999] same kind of explosion in unmet demand

[1063.44 - 1069.14] in generative AI jobs so skill up I'm

[1067.64 - 1071.1200000000001] probably going to work with some people

[1069.14 - 1073.1000000000001] to develop some some actual training

[1071.12 - 1075.3799999999999] material so stay tuned for that because

[1073.1 - 1076.9399999999998] hey if I can help people transition and

[1075.38 - 1078.5590000000002] survive at least for the next five years

[1076.94 - 1081.2] again I don't know what's going to

[1078.559 - 1083.12] happen long term 5 10 20 years we might

[1081.2 - 1084.32] be pivoting to post labor economics we

[1083.12 - 1086.78] might not like I said I could be

[1084.32 - 1088.22] completely wrong about that but a lot of

[1086.78 - 1091.039] people that I talk to

[1088.22 - 1093.08] in government in research and health

[1091.039 - 1094.34] care and other places a lot of people do

[1093.08 - 1096.02] agree with me that we were probably

[1094.34 - 1098.12] heading towards post-labor economics

[1096.02 - 1100.58] eventually we just don't really know

[1098.12 - 1102.7399999999998] when right now General consensus seems

[1100.58 - 1104.78] to be people are saying like five to ten

[1102.74 - 1106.84] years and that by 20 years we should

[1104.78 - 1108.9189999999999] probably have made the transition again

[1106.84 - 1110.6599999999999] predictions you know take it with a

[1108.919 - 1112.94] grain of salt and then finally voter

[1110.66 - 1115.94] solidarity like I said we rarely see

[1112.94 - 1117.6200000000001] this much uh consensus but that means

[1115.94 - 1120.02] that we need to demand we need to use

[1117.62 - 1123.08] that consensus to demand transparency

[1120.02 - 1124.4] and demand accountability so don't count

[1123.08 - 1126.32] your chickens before they hatch and

[1124.4 - 1128.419] maintain a sense of constant vigilance

[1126.32 - 1130.28] thanks for watching I hope you got a lot
