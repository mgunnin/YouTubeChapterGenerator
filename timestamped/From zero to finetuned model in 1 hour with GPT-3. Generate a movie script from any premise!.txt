[0.32 - 5.04] hey everyone david shapiro here

[2.72 - 7.120000000000001] with a new kind of video i'm going to

[5.04 - 9.280000000000001] try i've had this idea for a while i've

[7.12 - 11.120000000000001] had this idea of doing a working session

[9.28 - 12.559] and what i mean by that is i'm just

[11.12 - 13.678999999999998] going to walk you through my entire

[12.559 - 15.599] process

[13.679 - 17.52] sometimes people don't really believe me

[15.599 - 19.279] when i tell them how fast i work or how

[17.52 - 21.52] easy this stuff is say you know what i'm

[19.279 - 24.16] just going to record it end to end

[21.52 - 25.519] and here's the project today

[24.16 - 28.16] someone said

[25.519 - 30.32] nicevid so this is my co-writing flash

[28.16 - 31.279] fiction with gpt3 let me zoom in a

[30.32 - 33.6] little bit

[31.279 - 35.2] um he says nicevid and the character

[33.6 - 38.0] dialog one i'm curious if you've tried

[35.2 - 39.760000000000005] using gpt3 to generate a high level

[38.0 - 42.079] logical plot summary where you prompt

[39.76 - 44.079] for a structure for a structure like

[42.079 - 46.879] setup incident an inciting incident

[44.079 - 48.64] midpoint false high etc etc in my

[46.879 - 49.919999999999995] experiments it is too extensive prompt

[48.64 - 52.239000000000004] chaining perhaps that's because it's

[49.92 - 54.399] more complex task i say i tried that

[52.239 - 55.76] with my auto muse project and it was not

[54.399 - 57.36] great at it however this is something

[55.76 - 59.358999999999995] that could be fine-tuned

[57.36 - 61.199] so that gave me an idea let me do an

[59.359 - 62.800000000000004] outline generator so i just created this

[61.199 - 64.559] repo

[62.8 - 66.79899999999999] here is the repo here

[64.559 - 68.08] um

[66.799 - 69.92] and uh

[68.08 - 72.0] i've added a couple files i just added

[69.92 - 74.4] my api key

[72.0 - 75.6] and and a boilerplate thing so let me

[74.4 - 79.2] just show you

[75.6 - 80.72] cd outline generator get status

[79.2 - 82.24000000000001] get add

[80.72 - 83.36] git commit

[82.24 - 85.52] am

[83.36 - 87.52] initial commit

[85.52 - 89.119] get push

[87.52 - 91.6] okay so you will see

[89.119 - 93.759] i just did i just did a push

[91.6 - 96.079] there's only a handful of files in here

[93.759 - 99.119] let's get started okay so the first

[96.079 - 102.15899999999999] thing to do with this is

[99.119 - 104.0] playground let's go to text davinci o2

[102.159 - 106.96000000000001] so the very first thing let me zoom back

[104.0 - 106.96] in here is

[107.28 - 110.96000000000001] uh we need some raw data to work with so

[109.439 - 112.63999999999999] we're going to synthesize some data so

[110.96 - 114.79899999999999] the first thing is

[112.64 - 116.719] let's just right off the cuff let's see

[114.799 - 119.60000000000001] if this prompt works

[116.719 - 121.6] write a detailed

[119.6 - 125.759] um

[121.6 - 130.56] uh no not right imagine no brainstorm

[125.759 - 132.239] there we go brainstorm a plot synopsis

[130.56 - 133.52] for a random

[132.239 - 135.92000000000002] story

[133.52 - 135.92000000000002] um

[136.0 - 140.64] let's say

[137.12 - 143.44] detailed plot synopsis um

[140.64 - 145.35999999999999] and let's just see what that does

[143.44 - 148.0] the town of shepherd's town is a

[145.36 - 149.36] historic located in appalachian of blah

[148.0 - 150.239] blah blah sorry i'm trying to read too

[149.36 - 151.76000000000002] fast

[150.239 - 153.44] um

[151.76 - 154.959] this is great

[153.44 - 157.2] and it decides

[154.959 - 158.879] okay keeps going okay perfect so the

[157.2 - 161.04] town of shepherdstown is a historic

[158.879 - 162.79999999999998] small town located in the appalachian

[161.04 - 164.56] mountains of west virginia

[162.8 - 165.92000000000002] the town is home to a variety of shops

[164.56 - 168.16] and businesses as well as a number of

[165.92 - 169.35999999999999] different families the mcbride family

[168.16 - 171.12] has lived in shepherdstown for

[169.36 - 172.959] generations and they own a large farm on

[171.12 - 174.48000000000002] the outskirts of town the youngest

[172.959 - 176.16] mcbride daughter lizzie is a

[174.48 - 178.23899999999998] free-spirited 18 year old who has always

[176.16 - 179.76] been drawn to the town's history she

[178.239 - 181.20000000000002] loves to explore the old buildings and

[179.76 - 182.79999999999998] learn about the town's past one day

[181.2 - 184.879] lizzie discovers a hidden room in one of

[182.8 - 186.87900000000002] the buildings one of the old buildings

[184.879 - 188.64] the room is filled with dusty old boxes

[186.879 - 190.07999999999998] and furniture lizzie starts to explore

[188.64 - 192.48] and she finds a secret passage that

[190.08 - 193.92000000000002] leads to hidden staircase she climbs the

[192.48 - 195.44] staircase to find herself in a secret

[193.92 - 198.0] attic the attic is filled with old

[195.44 - 199.92] clothes furniture and books

[198.0 - 201.36] lizzie starts to look through the books

[199.92 - 203.04] and she finds an old journal the journal

[201.36 - 204.799] is filled with the handwritten accounts

[203.04 - 206.319] of the town's history at least lizzie is

[204.799 - 208.4] fascinated by the journal and decides to

[206.319 - 210.159] start her own research project on the

[208.4 - 212.159] town's history she spends the summer

[210.159 - 214.48] exploring the town's past and learning

[212.159 - 216.879] this like oh man this is some pure

[214.48 - 219.51899999999998] literary fiction right here okay so

[216.879 - 222.39999999999998] we've got a an initial prompt

[219.519 - 225.20000000000002] so let's go ahead and just save this

[222.4 - 227.59900000000002] um and we'll say we'll call this um

[225.2 - 228.879] prompt underscore premise

[227.599 - 232.72] dot text

[228.879 - 235.67999999999998] and so then what i do is i've got this

[232.72 - 239.28] this script that i'm starting um

[235.68 - 240.4] let's change this to davinci

[239.28 - 243.76] o2

[240.4 - 245.84] and we'll use the same um the same

[243.76 - 247.28] settings so no frequency penalty no

[245.84 - 248.56] presence penalty

[247.28 - 251.28] um

[248.56 - 253.2] i'll leave these the stops actually i'll

[251.28 - 255.36] just remove those because they are not

[253.2 - 258.239] relevant to this project

[255.36 - 261.35900000000004] okay i think that's all we need

[258.239 - 263.75899999999996] so go with pep8 two new lines beneath

[261.359 - 266.88] each one okay so this is a function that

[263.759 - 269.04] i copy paste in all my projects

[266.88 - 271.919] some people have noticed that that every

[269.04 - 273.6] now and then your your um

[271.919 - 275.919] your prompt will fail

[273.6 - 277.91900000000004] and uh or your completion will fail and

[275.919 - 279.84] so i just have a retry built in it

[277.919 - 281.03999999999996] rarely needs that especially nowadays i

[279.84 - 283.59999999999997] think they i think they've upped their

[281.04 - 286.24] capacity but basically i just say like

[283.6 - 289.44] um oh i need to import sleep as well

[286.24 - 291.36] um from time import sleep

[289.44 - 293.919] um so basically it'll just wait a second

[291.36 - 294.84000000000003] and then try again in case it fails to

[293.919 - 298.0] talk to

[294.84 - 301.919] openai okay so for this

[298.0 - 303.28] since i like the prompt let's do if

[301.919 - 304.79999999999995] name

[303.28 - 306.71999999999997] equals

[304.8 - 309.6] main and this is not strictly required

[306.72 - 311.52000000000004] for this just because it's um

[309.6 - 312.8] prototyping i could just jump straight

[311.52 - 315.19899999999996] into a loop

[312.8 - 316.72] however this is good practice to do if

[315.199 - 318.8] name equals main if you want to call

[316.72 - 320.32000000000005] this from something else

[318.8 - 322.16] i'm not going to do that since i just do

[320.32 - 324.479] imperative programming and rapid

[322.16 - 326.32000000000005] prototyping but i just got in the habit

[324.479 - 328.24] and i like it because it just says okay

[326.32 - 331.12] let's demarcate this okay

[328.24 - 332.32] um let's see for i in

[331.12 - 333.28000000000003] range

[332.32 - 336.08] um

[333.28 - 338.71999999999997] let's see 0 to

[336.08 - 339.84] 10. let's just do 10 for now

[338.72 - 340.88000000000005] um

[339.84 - 342.08] let's see

[340.88 - 343.68] premise

[342.08 - 345.28] equals

[343.68 - 348.24] um

[345.28 - 352.35999999999996] gpt3 completion

[348.24 - 352.36] prompt equals 08.

[352.8 - 355.68] prompt equals

[356.8 - 363.039] need to load the file

[359.919 - 363.039] so i'll just copy this

[363.36 - 368.0] with open and what did i call it prompt

[366.0 - 369.44] premise

[368.0 - 372.4] because i will use different prompts in

[369.44 - 375.6] the future as in file so we'll say

[372.4 - 377.67999999999995] prompt equals infile dot read

[375.6 - 379.36] okay oh and another thing i forgot is

[377.68 - 383.28000000000003] what i do is i

[379.36 - 384.8] i grab the the output and i strip it so

[383.28 - 387.59999999999997] that removes all

[384.8 - 389.68] white space on from the edges and then i

[387.6 - 391.03900000000004] also do a

[389.68 - 393.6] regex

[391.039 - 395.68] swap replace for any any additional

[393.6 - 397.68] white space and just replace it with an

[395.68 - 399.36] individual space so in this case if it

[397.68 - 401.039] adds too much vertical space like new

[399.36 - 403.12] lines i want to remove all the new lines

[401.039 - 406.639] just so it ends up with a single block

[403.12 - 408.479] of text like you see here

[406.639 - 411.199] it's it's not always necessary but

[408.479 - 412.88] sometimes gpt3 will spit out too much

[411.199 - 415.84000000000003] too much vertical white space and i want

[412.88 - 417.199] to condense it um so that's why i have

[415.84 - 420.4] this little bit here and that actually

[417.199 - 422.40000000000003] reminds me i need to also import

[420.4 - 426.63899999999995] three which is regex

[422.4 - 428.56] um okay so premise equals

[426.639 - 430.56] gpt three completion prompt so that'll

[428.56 - 433.12] pass in the prompt i've got the engine

[430.56 - 435.52] set to default to text davinci o2

[433.12 - 436.72] i've got tokens 500 just in case it gets

[435.52 - 438.56] cut off

[436.72 - 441.03900000000004] but you see here the uh

[438.56 - 443.039] these instructions are super short

[441.039 - 443.919] because text davinci o2 is pretty darn

[443.039 - 447.199] good

[443.919 - 449.35999999999996] um okay so let's run this

[447.199 - 451.199] oh wait i actually need to save it okay

[449.36 - 452.40000000000003] so let's see with

[451.199 - 453.36] open

[452.4 - 456.63899999999995] um

[453.36 - 457.84000000000003] what did i name that folder premises

[456.639 - 460.40000000000003] uh

[457.84 - 462.0] premises

[460.4 - 464.479] slash

[462.0 - 466.879] uh i guess i need a file name

[464.479 - 466.87899999999996] um

[468.72 - 472.879] let's do let's start at one and go to

[473.12 - 476.84000000000003] 200

[475.36 - 478.72] file name

[476.84 - 481.19899999999996] equals

[478.72 - 483.59900000000005] premise underscore dollar

[481.199 - 483.599] or a

[483.68 - 486.319] text insert i don't remember the name of

[485.28 - 488.479] that right now

[486.319 - 491.599] text and then we'll do

[488.479 - 495.28] i okay so that will give us a serial

[491.599 - 498.319] number so we'll then we'll say premises

[495.28 - 499.75899999999996] that and do file name

[498.319 - 503.84000000000003] write

[499.759 - 507.12] encoding equals utf-8

[503.84 - 509.19899999999996] i always do utf-8 because gpt3 sometimes

[507.12 - 510.56] outputs stuff that will not encode an

[509.199 - 512.5600000000001] ascii

[510.56 - 516.24] or other simpler things and utf-8 is

[512.56 - 517.5989999999999] just universal um so we'll do

[516.24 - 521.44] oops

[517.599 - 524.6400000000001] as out file

[521.44 - 527.6800000000001] out file dot right

[524.64 - 529.279] uh premise i think that's i think that's

[527.68 - 531.92] all i need to do

[529.279 - 533.68] um and then we'll do an exit right here

[531.92 - 535.519] so what i often do is just for debugging

[533.68 - 536.56] and testing i'll just have it do one

[535.519 - 538.72] instance

[536.56 - 541.1999999999999] um

[538.72 - 544.1600000000001] and then let's add a print

[541.2 - 544.1600000000001] print premise

[544.8 - 548.3199999999999] we'll do

[545.68 - 550.7199999999999] ui newline new line

[548.32 - 552.8000000000001] premise so that way we can separate them

[550.72 - 554.399] all out exit so that'll just be a quick

[552.8 - 556.56] test

[554.399 - 559.44] make sure okay

[556.56 - 564.2399999999999] i think that's it so python

[559.44 - 564.24] generate premises can i zoom in on this

[565.839 - 569.0400000000001] can i make this bigger

[567.92 - 570.64] edit

[569.04 - 573.5999999999999] properties

[570.64 - 577.12] uh cursor no not cursor size

[573.6 - 578.48] font there we go

[577.12 - 579.92] make the font a little bit bigger so you

[578.48 - 581.04] can see there we go look at that

[579.92 - 582.4799999999999] beautiful

[581.04 - 584.3199999999999] let's go a little bit bigger so that you

[582.48 - 587.04] can see what the heck is going on you

[584.32 - 588.5600000000001] don't have to squint at your screen 36

[587.04 - 590.0] that's enormous

[588.56 - 592.3199999999999] maybe that's a little too big ah heck

[590.0 - 592.32] with it

[594.08 - 598.32] no module named openai really i forgot

[596.48 - 603.72] to re okay so i recently reinstalled my

[598.32 - 603.72] computer um pip install open ai

[607.279 - 612.16] the rest of this while that's installing

[609.44 - 614.399] the rest of these um time and regex are

[612.16 - 617.279] our default um

[614.399 - 619.839] with uh gpt3 um so you don't need or not

[617.279 - 623.68] gpg3 python sorry um the only the only

[619.839 - 623.6800000000001] module i need to install here is open ai

[624.72 - 629.44] okay successfully built installing it's

[627.68 - 631.5999999999999] doing all this fun stuff

[629.44 - 633.839] okay let's try that again python

[631.6 - 637.76] generate premises

[633.839 - 639.12] error communicating is not valid under

[637.76 - 641.68] interesting

[639.12 - 642.72] it doesn't like it

[641.68 - 645.279] okay

[642.72 - 647.12] i guess it doesn't like my empty

[645.279 - 649.68] whatchamacallit here so we'll just do

[647.12 - 651.2] blah blah

[649.68 - 653.4399999999999] maybe i should exclude that if i'm not

[651.2 - 656.9590000000001] going to have anything meaningful in it

[653.44 - 660.36] okay let's try again do a clear screen

[656.959 - 660.3599999999999] generate premises

[660.56 - 665.5999999999999] and the answer is save gpt3 log is not

[663.44 - 667.519] defined oh right because i grabbed this

[665.6 - 671.44] function from something else

[667.519 - 673.44] um save gpt3 log um so i usually in in a

[671.44 - 675.36] lot of my projects is i'll save every

[673.44 - 677.0400000000001] interaction with gpt3 so let me just

[675.36 - 678.399] comment that out

[677.04 - 680.64] um

[678.399 - 681.92] my bad sorry again

[680.64 - 683.4399999999999] i told you i was going to go through the

[681.92 - 685.68] entire process

[683.44 - 687.2790000000001] um this is this is what prototyping

[685.68 - 690.88] looks like with dave

[687.279 - 693.279] um hopefully it'll work this time

[690.88 - 695.04] fail fast and keep going there we go

[693.279 - 697.8389999999999] okay cool look at this

[695.04 - 700.88] um incomplete format

[697.839 - 703.12] oh yeah i did do that i it i called me

[700.88 - 704.64] out on my on my crap i messed it up here

[703.12 - 706.079] okay the sky is orange and the sun is

[704.64 - 708.48] red casting an ear glow over the small

[706.079 - 710.8] town of shepherdstown

[708.48 - 711.6] um it really likes shepherdstown doesn't

[710.8 - 712.959] it

[711.6 - 714.48] i wonder how often it will do

[712.959 - 715.5189999999999] shepherdstown because the the one up

[714.48 - 717.6800000000001] here

[715.519 - 720.0] also says shepherdstown

[717.68 - 720.0] um

[720.56 - 726.0] interesting okay whatever

[723.519 - 727.76] if it if it lights that that's fine um

[726.0 - 732.0] we'll see if it if it repeats that but

[727.76 - 735.279] let's go fix this thing because i missed

[732.0 - 738.959] we need the percent s for file name

[735.279 - 738.959] okay and that should

[740.8 - 745.92] if i'm not mistaken it will not have

[743.68 - 749.4399999999999] yeah it did not succeed

[745.92 - 749.4399999999999] okay generate premises

[750.639 - 754.519] let's see what it does this time

[758.079 - 764.0] shannon left to run the family okay so

[760.399 - 764.0] this generated a premise um

[764.079 - 766.56] yep

[764.959 - 768.399] she knows it would be inappropriate to

[766.56 - 770.0] pursue a relationship with someone she

[768.399 - 771.519] is employer

[770.0 - 773.04] so that's a that's a typo that doesn't

[771.519 - 774.72] make any sense shannon and diego must

[773.04 - 777.1999999999999] find a way to resist their feelings so

[774.72 - 778.639] this came up with a with a romance um so

[777.2 - 782.0790000000001] one thing you can do

[778.639 - 784.48] is i often will do um

[782.079 - 787.3599999999999] i'll often have placeholders so like

[784.48 - 789.6] let's say we want to modify the premise

[787.36 - 791.04] for a random story let's say like

[789.6 - 793.12] you know

[791.04 - 795.5999999999999] romance story actually let's do it this

[793.12 - 796.5600000000001] way so we'll do romance and instead of

[795.6 - 798.32] doing

[796.56 - 800.56] um

[798.32 - 803.519] instead of doing

[800.56 - 805.1999999999999] 200 of each one we'll do like

[803.519 - 806.399] we'll do like 50. so i'll do like

[805.2 - 808.72] romance

[806.399 - 811.839] um science fiction

[808.72 - 814.8000000000001] fantasy and like uh literary fiction or

[811.839 - 816.9590000000001] something so we'll just do 50 of each

[814.8 - 818.959] and we'll do

[816.959 - 821.1199999999999] premise

[818.959 - 822.959] romance

[821.12 - 824.399] there we go i think this will be good so

[822.959 - 826.079] then we'll get it we'll get a broader

[824.399 - 827.199] variety

[826.079 - 829.12] um

[827.199 - 831.5999999999999] yes okay

[829.12 - 833.12] so then we can assume that this yes

[831.6 - 834.9590000000001] premise1.txt

[833.12 - 836.16] yay look at that and actually let's

[834.959 - 838.7199999999999] switch this

[836.16 - 841.519] open with choose another program notepad

[838.72 - 843.6] plus plus always use notepad plus plus

[841.519 - 844.88] okay so there you have it you see we've

[843.6 - 846.639] got a premise

[844.88 - 848.8] um for a story

[846.639 - 853.04] and so let's go ahead and close that

[848.8 - 853.04] and that that took um

[854.959 - 858.8] what am i doing manage account

[857.12 - 860.16] okay

[858.8 - 862.399] usage

[860.16 - 864.959] this will take a minute to load but this

[862.399 - 867.44] is stupid cheap um

[864.959 - 871.279] because that was like 200

[867.44 - 873.519] that was like 200 um tokens um so yeah

[871.279 - 876.16] that was that last one

[873.519 - 880.8] was 164 tokens and it cost less than a

[876.16 - 882.639] penny 266 tokens cost 2 cents so

[880.8 - 884.7199999999999] you know if i generate 200 of these

[882.639 - 887.04] premises it'll be about a dollar

[884.72 - 889.6] right um and if you've been watching my

[887.04 - 891.36] youtube channel this month um

[889.6 - 894.0] everything that i've shown you has cost

[891.36 - 897.1990000000001] two dollars that is how cheap gpt3 is

[894.0 - 899.839] getting to use okay so a quick little

[897.199 - 902.3199999999999] aside let's comment out the exit so we

[899.839 - 903.6800000000001] should generate now 50

[902.32 - 906.1600000000001] premises

[903.68 - 908.16] um of romance

[906.16 - 911.68] um and then we'll change this to sci-fi

[908.16 - 914.7199999999999] fantasy and other stuff do a quick save

[911.68 - 916.399] so now we'll do cls python generate

[914.72 - 919.279] premises

[916.399 - 921.519] okay so basically this is step one of

[919.279 - 923.92] generating synthetic data

[921.519 - 925.6] and i've been doing this for

[923.92 - 929.12] let me pause my video for a second to

[925.6 - 931.839] see how long okay so that was 15 minutes

[929.12 - 932.88] um from zero to getting

[931.839 - 933.9200000000001] um

[932.88 - 937.04] a

[933.92 - 939.36] unlimited number of synthetic data

[937.04 - 942.16] we uh we're going from here and you see

[939.36 - 944.72] it's outputting everything as it goes

[942.16 - 946.8] it looks like it's using some similar

[944.72 - 948.32] stuff over and over again

[946.8 - 950.3199999999999] interesting jenna is looking forward to

[948.32 - 951.9200000000001] the weekend

[950.32 - 953.1990000000001] okay so it is it is a little bit

[951.92 - 955.519] repetitive

[953.199 - 957.12] that's interesting i wonder if there's

[955.519 - 959.519] something we can do

[957.12 - 961.199] to make it a little less repetitive

[959.519 - 962.72] at the beach house

[961.199 - 965.12] beach house

[962.72 - 967.44] all right so solutioning time this is

[965.12 - 968.5600000000001] way too darn repetitive

[967.44 - 971.9200000000001] um

[968.56 - 972.88] i think we might need to have a first

[971.92 - 976.88] thing

[972.88 - 976.88] something that kind of stands before

[976.959 - 983.1199999999999] um generating a premise okay so

[980.839 - 986.32] uh generate

[983.12 - 987.759] a list of random

[986.32 - 989.6800000000001] characters

[987.759 - 992.0790000000001] locations

[989.68 - 992.079] um

[992.48 - 995.839] and

[993.36 - 999.92] genres

[995.839 - 999.9200000000001] then we'll just do a dash there

[1000.16 - 1004.56] giraffe lighthouse comedy

[1002.56 - 1008.16] okay

[1004.56 - 1008.16] well that's interesting um

[1009.36 - 1014.48] uh let's say long list

[1012.399 - 1016.88] and see what that does because a giraffe

[1014.48 - 1018.9590000000001] lighthouse comedy

[1016.88 - 1022.72] that's not helpful

[1018.959 - 1025.6] um oh random characters let's see

[1022.72 - 1030.0] so we need to tell it for a story um

[1025.6 - 1031.52] this is for brainstorming

[1030.0 - 1032.88] a story

[1031.52 - 1034.959] generate a long list of random

[1032.88 - 1037.959] characters locations and genres there we

[1034.959 - 1037.959] go

[1038.88 - 1043.5200000000002] oh good good good good okay

[1040.959 - 1045.199] so here's what happens is it gives us

[1043.52 - 1047.36] some random stuff

[1045.199 - 1048.799] um let's run this a couple times to see

[1047.36 - 1050.3999999999999] if it gives us

[1048.799 - 1052.08] um similar things because like a group

[1050.4 - 1055.6000000000001] of friends who get stranded on a desert

[1052.08 - 1055.6] island camping trip in the woods

[1058.559 - 1062.3999999999999] let's see if it's repetitive again

[1063.28 - 1068.0] a family who owns a farm group of

[1064.88 - 1070.0800000000002] students okay yeah this is this is okay

[1068.0 - 1072.16] this is a little bit more random

[1070.08 - 1074.3999999999999] um

[1072.16 - 1075.76] run it a few more times skilled archer

[1074.4 - 1077.6000000000001] town that is terrorized by a band of

[1075.76 - 1080.32] robbers dark forest

[1077.6 - 1082.559] oh this is great a final battle between

[1080.32 - 1084.3999999999999] good and evil wonderful

[1082.559 - 1086.32] um okay

[1084.4 - 1088.24] so here's what we're going to do we are

[1086.32 - 1090.3999999999999] going to create another prompt that

[1088.24 - 1093.36] stands before the first one because we

[1090.4 - 1097.1200000000001] saw that it was being way too repetitive

[1093.36 - 1098.6399999999999] okay um let's call this prompt

[1097.12 - 1100.2399999999998] brainstorming

[1098.64 - 1101.919] brainstorm okay

[1100.24 - 1104.64] so first

[1101.919 - 1107.88] we're going to do that

[1104.64 - 1107.88] and then

[1108.4 - 1111.679] ooh ooh i'm gonna need to change this

[1110.24 - 1114.559] because we don't want we want to

[1111.679 - 1116.16] actually split the lines

[1114.559 - 1117.039] yeah

[1116.16 - 1122.039] okay

[1117.039 - 1122.039] so we'll need to change a couple things

[1123.76 - 1127.12] let's see how should i approach this i

[1125.6 - 1129.52] think i'm just going to need to take

[1127.12 - 1131.76] this out

[1129.52 - 1132.96] because we want to maintain the lines

[1131.76 - 1135.96] and

[1132.96 - 1135.96] um

[1137.52 - 1140.24] we will say

[1141.6 - 1146.12] i don't want to waste too many tokens

[1153.76 - 1157.36] um

[1156.0 - 1160.16] actually let's simplify this because i

[1157.36 - 1161.4399999999998] don't need multiple outputs i need just

[1160.16 - 1165.3600000000001] one

[1161.44 - 1168.799] generate a list um

[1165.36 - 1171.1999999999998] generate a list of well no because

[1168.799 - 1173.2] having a list output allows it to be

[1171.2 - 1175.039] more creative because there will be some

[1173.2 - 1177.3600000000001] slight variances

[1175.039 - 1179.2] oh also oh i wonder if i could fix this

[1177.36 - 1181.039] just by turning up the temperature

[1179.2 - 1182.32] let's go back before we get too carried

[1181.039 - 1184.24] away let's turn up the temperature a

[1182.32 - 1186.96] little

[1184.24 - 1189.2] one dot zero because this can go up to

[1186.96 - 1190.64] this can go up to two okay before before

[1189.2 - 1194.24] we get too carried away with over

[1190.64 - 1197.2800000000002] solutioning it let's try simple things

[1194.24 - 1199.679] so over here we've got seven romances

[1197.28 - 1201.6] looking at the console output

[1199.679 - 1204.5590000000002] most of them involve jenna most of them

[1201.6 - 1206.48] involve the weekend at a beach house so

[1204.559 - 1208.559] all right let's see if we can restart

[1206.48 - 1210.559] this and we get a better

[1208.559 - 1212.8799999999999] um better set of outputs

[1210.559 - 1216.0] um let's see let's go back here

[1212.88 - 1217.5200000000002] python generate premises

[1216.0 - 1221.52] all right so all i did was i changed the

[1217.52 - 1223.44] temperature from 0.7 to 1.0

[1221.52 - 1225.679] um so let's see if we get that

[1223.44 - 1227.3600000000001] repetitiveness again

[1225.679 - 1229.2800000000002] jenna is looking forward to her evening

[1227.36 - 1231.1999999999998] run okay that's a little bit better

[1229.28 - 1233.2] jenna and ryan hit it off

[1231.2 - 1234.88] tamara is a successful businesswoman who

[1233.2 - 1236.48] seems to have it all she's beautiful and

[1234.88 - 1238.96] smart great

[1236.48 - 1240.799] starting to get some variety

[1238.96 - 1242.32] oh but you see how we're getting some

[1240.799 - 1243.28] some more vertical white space that i

[1242.32 - 1245.52] don't like

[1243.28 - 1248.799] hannah sets cross country road trip good

[1245.52 - 1251.2] linda's high powered executive

[1248.799 - 1252.4] yeah okay this is getting better

[1251.2 - 1254.0800000000002] so

[1252.4 - 1256.4] the simple thing is the better thing all

[1254.08 - 1258.0] i had to do is turn up the temperature

[1256.4 - 1260.4] let's add the

[1258.0 - 1262.48] canceling the white space add that back

[1260.4 - 1264.3200000000002] in that's fine for now

[1262.48 - 1266.159] jenny is a young woman who is struggling

[1264.32 - 1268.24] to find her place in the world good

[1266.159 - 1270.24] rachel is a successful young one notice

[1268.24 - 1271.1200000000001] how all the romances start with with a

[1270.24 - 1273.44] woman

[1271.12 - 1273.4399999999998] um

[1273.84 - 1277.6] falls in love with luke who learns to

[1275.52 - 1278.96] trust again

[1277.6 - 1281.12] sherry had always been a hopeless

[1278.96 - 1284.159] romantic so here's what i'll do

[1281.12 - 1285.9189999999999] i'll wait for this to get to about

[1284.159 - 1288.0800000000002] um

[1285.919 - 1291.1200000000001] like 20 or so or

[1288.08 - 1293.6] 25 rather and then i'll change the

[1291.12 - 1295.76] prompt actually no i don't need to stop

[1293.6 - 1297.4399999999998] it all i need to do is change the prompt

[1295.76 - 1299.12] um

[1297.44 - 1300.48] so we'll go to this so this is this is

[1299.12 - 1302.799] one advantage actually no that won't

[1300.48 - 1306.48] work because i only load the prompt once

[1302.799 - 1309.6] um yeah so for every iteration if i move

[1306.48 - 1311.679] this up into the into the loop then i

[1309.6 - 1314.08] could just change the prompt mid flight

[1311.679 - 1317.1200000000001] so actually let's do that

[1314.08 - 1319.6] um so let's do that put that here

[1317.12 - 1321.12] so now while it's iterating i can change

[1319.6 - 1323.9189999999999] the prompt mid-flight without having to

[1321.12 - 1326.4799999999998] cancel it um that'll be nice

[1323.919 - 1327.8400000000001] long day of work to her loving fiance

[1326.48 - 1330.32] miles

[1327.84 - 1332.8799999999999] um jenna and the stranger

[1330.32 - 1334.72] when olivia's mom dies she's left to

[1332.88 - 1335.8400000000001] fend for herself

[1334.72 - 1337.6000000000001] um

[1335.84 - 1340.6399999999999] so this is all this is all very like

[1337.6 - 1342.559] anglo-centric these are all like typical

[1340.64 - 1344.88] pretty much typically american names

[1342.559 - 1346.48] these aren't even like european names

[1344.88 - 1350.48] um so

[1346.48 - 1352.72] let me go ahead and pause this now

[1350.48 - 1354.96] and let's add a little bit of variety

[1352.72 - 1358.08] but first we're going to want to change

[1354.96 - 1360.96] where it starts okay so we're at 16

[1358.08 - 1362.3999999999999] so let's go here and we'll start

[1360.96 - 1364.96] um

[1362.4 - 1366.24] we'll go we'll start at 17 and we'll go

[1364.96 - 1368.08] up to

[1366.24 - 1369.84] uh let's see let's

[1368.08 - 1371.9189999999999] we'll just go up to 30.

[1369.84 - 1373.6789999999999] and then we'll change this to

[1371.919 - 1374.7990000000002] uh let's close that one so i stopped

[1373.679 - 1376.48] clicking on it

[1374.799 - 1378.32] um

[1376.48 - 1380.96] for brainstorm a detailed plot synopsis

[1378.32 - 1383.6] for a random romance let's say europe

[1380.96 - 1386.159] no let's say french romance story

[1383.6 - 1387.36] um and watch how much just one word

[1386.159 - 1390.159] changes

[1387.36 - 1390.1589999999999] this output

[1390.24 - 1394.559] and let's see make sure that i change

[1392.4 - 1396.72] the where it starts

[1394.559 - 1400.1589999999999] so it'll go from 17 to 30.

[1396.72 - 1401.3600000000001] uh okay that'll be fine

[1400.159 - 1402.96] okay

[1401.36 - 1405.4399999999998] so because basically what we're doing

[1402.96 - 1407.679] now is we're oh elise there we go

[1405.44 - 1408.72] dashing parisian gentleman pierre oh

[1407.679 - 1410.72] wonderful

[1408.72 - 1413.28] um okay so what we're doing is we're

[1410.72 - 1414.72] generating synthetic

[1413.28 - 1416.799] data right now

[1414.72 - 1418.64] so ultimately this will be the input

[1416.799 - 1420.799] that we use in the future why is it

[1418.64 - 1423.2] paused there we go oh wow

[1420.799 - 1424.08] that's a much longer one excellent

[1423.2 - 1426.4] um

[1424.08 - 1429.4399999999998] so you know we got 17 like you know

[1426.4 - 1430.48] white bred american um premise romance

[1429.44 - 1433.039] plots

[1430.48 - 1434.88] um and we're gonna use those to generate

[1433.039 - 1437.2] um like a three-act structure in a

[1434.88 - 1439.2] little bit um but we want variety right

[1437.2 - 1442.88] we don't want just anglo-centric

[1439.2 - 1446.0] american stories we want a variety so um

[1442.88 - 1447.3600000000001] oh look at that name antoinette gautier

[1446.0 - 1449.2] ha

[1447.36 - 1451.4399999999998] love this

[1449.2 - 1453.2] meets brooding so there's another

[1451.44 - 1455.039] problem um meats breeding artist cloud

[1453.2 - 1456.799] monet oh wow look at that look at that

[1455.039 - 1458.08] this is great okay

[1456.799 - 1460.1589999999999] sorry i'm just really happy really

[1458.08 - 1461.9189999999999] excited about this the goal the reason

[1460.159 - 1464.7990000000002] why they're numbered is because we got

[1461.919 - 1466.159] to get up to 200 total

[1464.799 - 1468.0] um

[1466.159 - 1469.679] so 200 total

[1468.0 - 1472.96] that's going to be enough

[1469.679 - 1474.72] for us to uh for us to um what am i

[1472.96 - 1476.799] trying to say sorry i'm thinking really

[1474.72 - 1479.279] fast and my mouth can't keep up

[1476.799 - 1481.52] we need to get a minimum of 200 samples

[1479.279 - 1483.84] in order to

[1481.52 - 1485.44] fine tune a model that is open ai's

[1483.84 - 1488.799] recommended um

[1485.44 - 1488.799] kind of baseline minimum

[1490.32 - 1492.8799999999999] okay

[1493.12 - 1497.6] pardon me i have to check uh i have to

[1495.279 - 1500.159] check something

[1497.6 - 1501.6789999999999] okay sorry about that pause um but i

[1500.159 - 1503.3600000000001] think that's fine for you guys as

[1501.679 - 1504.96] watching the video just skipped ahead

[1503.36 - 1506.9599999999998] okay so now we've got

[1504.96 - 1507.919] um 30

[1506.96 - 1510.48] uh

[1507.919 - 1513.8400000000001] well zero one one through 29

[1510.48 - 1515.3600000000001] um premises um just scrolling up here

[1513.84 - 1517.4399999999998] francois is a young woman who lives in

[1515.36 - 1519.36] paris with her husband um oh that looks

[1517.44 - 1521.2] like that repeated that's okay it's okay

[1519.36 - 1523.76] if we get some repetition so what have

[1521.2 - 1525.8400000000001] we learned so far we've learned to turn

[1523.76 - 1527.52] the temperature up a little bit let's go

[1525.84 - 1530.0] up a little bit higher next time just to

[1527.52 - 1531.679] see um it can start to go off the rails

[1530.0 - 1533.44] so that's why i have the the console

[1531.679 - 1536.24] output just so i can see what what's

[1533.44 - 1538.4] doing um as i'm generating this data but

[1536.24 - 1539.919] already i've got about you know what is

[1538.4 - 1542.159] this 30 items

[1539.919 - 1544.3200000000002] um how much data is this this is 24

[1542.159 - 1545.919] kilobytes of data um that i didn't have

[1544.32 - 1547.36] to write all i did was tell the machine

[1545.919 - 1549.8400000000001] what i wanted it to do

[1547.36 - 1552.559] all right so first let's update

[1549.84 - 1553.76] our starting point so we'll go from 30

[1552.559 - 1558.8799999999999] to

[1553.76 - 1561.36] 45 we'll just do 15. and let's do a

[1558.88 - 1563.3600000000001] bollywood romance story

[1561.36 - 1565.9189999999999] um and this is going to take a while but

[1563.36 - 1567.52] i will explain stuff to you um as we go

[1565.919 - 1569.039] and if it gets too boring i'll pause the

[1567.52 - 1571.12] video so it'll just skip ahead so don't

[1569.039 - 1572.96] worry

[1571.12 - 1574.2399999999998] if i if i pause the video and it skips

[1572.96 - 1575.76] ahead it's just because i'm letting some

[1574.24 - 1579.36] of this process finish

[1575.76 - 1581.679] okay so let's do the generate premises

[1579.36 - 1584.3999999999999] but we change the prompt to bollywood

[1581.679 - 1586.24] romance and we've got the prompt premise

[1584.4 - 1588.24] and now the output is still premise

[1586.24 - 1590.0] romance and we're doing from number 30

[1588.24 - 1592.159] to 45.

[1590.0 - 1595.96] okay let's go let's see what happens

[1592.159 - 1595.96] let's see how these go

[1606.48 - 1610.4] ria and raj have been married for five

[1608.159 - 1612.7990000000002] years they have a two-year-old daughter

[1610.4 - 1614.3200000000002] look at this they moved to mumbai oh man

[1612.799 - 1615.2] this is wonderful

[1614.32 - 1616.96] um

[1615.2 - 1618.72] it's so creative and look how fast it's

[1616.96 - 1620.799] spitting this stuff out i could never i

[1618.72 - 1623.919] could never write this fast no human

[1620.799 - 1624.96] could no 10 people could

[1623.919 - 1627.3600000000001] so i'm just

[1624.96 - 1629.2] churning out um looks like it is a

[1627.36 - 1631.84] little repetitive raj and simran of

[1629.2 - 1632.72] course it could be that raj is a common

[1631.84 - 1634.1589999999999] name

[1632.72 - 1636.48] um i

[1634.159 - 1637.8400000000001] i i work with a lot of indian folks and

[1636.48 - 1639.52] i know that there are some common names

[1637.84 - 1642.0] like my name is dave that's freaking

[1639.52 - 1644.48] common right so like i know that like

[1642.0 - 1646.64] karthik and satish are ultra common

[1644.48 - 1647.52] names in uh in india

[1646.64 - 1649.8400000000001] um

[1647.52 - 1651.36] raul there's another common one

[1649.84 - 1653.279] so yeah

[1651.36 - 1655.76] it looks like having the temperature a

[1653.279 - 1657.679] little bit higher is good

[1655.76 - 1658.72] i'm not seeing repetitive patterns in

[1657.679 - 1660.88] here

[1658.72 - 1662.32] even the names are often

[1660.88 - 1664.0800000000002] unique

[1662.32 - 1666.6399999999999] that's good okay so while this is

[1664.08 - 1668.96] running let's see what are we up to 36

[1666.64 - 1671.2] so we've got about 10 more

[1668.96 - 1672.3990000000001] let's grab one of these

[1671.2 - 1674.24] oops

[1672.399 - 1675.6] if i know where i'm going okay so let's

[1674.24 - 1680.96] grab this

[1675.6 - 1685.12] and and start start figuring out um

[1680.96 - 1688.559] let's see um construct that's a good one

[1685.12 - 1691.6789999999999] construct a three act structure

[1688.559 - 1691.6789999999999] for the following

[1691.919 - 1695.5200000000002] yeah sure

[1693.2 - 1697.8400000000001] grammarly is like the most nagging

[1695.52 - 1699.279] grammar teacher ever but it helps me be

[1697.84 - 1700.1589999999999] a better writer

[1699.279 - 1702.559] also

[1700.159 - 1703.8400000000001] speaking of between gpt3 and grammarly

[1702.559 - 1705.52] you combine those two you're an

[1703.84 - 1707.279] unstoppable writer you can produce

[1705.52 - 1708.96] content so fast

[1707.279 - 1712.88] construct a three-act structure for the

[1708.96 - 1715.44] following um story premise

[1712.88 - 1717.8400000000001] um each

[1715.44 - 1719.279] each act should have

[1717.84 - 1721.6789999999999] a brief

[1719.279 - 1724.48] description

[1721.679 - 1726.48] one to two sentences

[1724.48 - 1727.76] okay

[1726.48 - 1729.52] premise

[1727.76 - 1734.72] so we'll do a premise there

[1729.52 - 1736.48] and now we'll do um three act structure

[1734.72 - 1740.32] act one

[1736.48 - 1740.32] all right let's see what this does

[1740.96 - 1744.32] it might just be

[1750.64 - 1754.24] all right let's see how this compares

[1760.72 - 1763.6000000000001] all right i guess i have to read it all

[1762.0 - 1765.2] out okay it all begins with samir a

[1763.6 - 1767.6789999999999] young man from a wealthy family meets

[1765.2 - 1769.44] naina a simple girl from a small village

[1767.679 - 1770.64] nina has come to the city to make a

[1769.44 - 1772.48] better life for herself she is

[1770.64 - 1774.3200000000002] immediately attracted to samir but is

[1772.48 - 1776.24] too shy to say anything oh a shy girl

[1774.32 - 1777.9189999999999] story um

[1776.24 - 1780.08] one day out of the blue samir expresses

[1777.919 - 1781.44] his feelings for naina and confesses his

[1780.08 - 1783.36] love for her

[1781.44 - 1785.3600000000001] nyena is overjoyed and eagerly accepts

[1783.36 - 1786.7199999999998] his proposal they begin to date and

[1785.36 - 1788.7199999999998] their families approve of the match

[1786.72 - 1790.799] however just as things seem to be going

[1788.72 - 1792.559] well samir smears father suddenly dies

[1790.799 - 1794.48] interesting leaving him the sole heir to

[1792.559 - 1796.6399999999999] the family business samir is forced to

[1794.48 - 1799.44] take on a lot of responsibility and

[1796.64 - 1801.1200000000001] doesn't have much time for naina oh oh

[1799.44 - 1803.279] man this is a good story i want to watch

[1801.12 - 1804.9599999999998] this movie

[1803.279 - 1806.48] uh naena begins to feel neglected and

[1804.96 - 1808.799] wonders if samir is really the man she

[1806.48 - 1810.24] thought he was um

[1808.799 - 1811.6] samir is soon caught in a world of money

[1810.24 - 1812.88] and power and nina feels like she is

[1811.6 - 1815.039] losing him one day she decides to go

[1812.88 - 1816.88] back to her village leaving samir behind

[1815.039 - 1818.64] samir realizes how much he loves nina

[1816.88 - 1819.919] and how much he has been neglecting her

[1818.64 - 1822.3200000000002] he decides to go to her village and

[1819.919 - 1823.76] confess his love nina is hesitant but

[1822.32 - 1825.6] eventually agrees to give him another

[1823.76 - 1826.8799999999999] chance they share a passionate embrace

[1825.6 - 1829.52] in their families rejoice at the news of

[1826.88 - 1831.3600000000001] their reunion oh man i can imagine so

[1829.52 - 1833.76] much song and dance in this bollywood

[1831.36 - 1836.1589999999999] picture okay so let's see how that

[1833.76 - 1837.36] has translated to a three-act structure

[1836.159 - 1839.279] act one

[1837.36 - 1840.4799999999998] um she's immediately attracted okay out

[1839.279 - 1843.84] of the blue

[1840.48 - 1848.32] it almost looks like it's just

[1843.84 - 1848.32] okay it's just splitting it up um

[1848.559 - 1853.12] this is not this is okay um

[1852.159 - 1854.96] break

[1853.12 - 1856.559] the following

[1854.96 - 1860.32] um

[1856.559 - 1863.6789999999999] uh following premise down into

[1860.32 - 1867.6] a list of major plot points

[1863.679 - 1871.0800000000002] use the save the cat model

[1867.6 - 1871.08] for screenplays

[1871.76 - 1875.679] okay so then let's try this again

[1876.96 - 1879.8400000000001] save the cat

[1878.399 - 1882.1589999999999] plot point one okay let's see what

[1879.84 - 1882.1589999999999] happens

[1884.52 - 1887.569] [Music]

[1890.799 - 1895.76] i don't like it it's not working

[1893.279 - 1899.039] hmm okay so this is where we have to get

[1895.76 - 1899.039] more and more creative

[1899.2 - 1903.76] because it's just regurgitating it and

[1901.039 - 1906.96] that's not exactly what i want

[1903.76 - 1908.1589999999999] and i want to avoid doing a doing a few

[1906.96 - 1910.72] shot

[1908.159 - 1910.72] example

[1913.36 - 1917.1999999999998] here let's break this down even simpler

[1919.679 - 1922.799] write a scene

[1924.0 - 1929.039] write the opening scene for the

[1926.64 - 1932.3990000000001] following

[1929.039 - 1935.12] no we we really do need an outline

[1932.399 - 1936.799] um let's see what was it translate or

[1935.12 - 1938.2399999999998] rewrite

[1936.799 - 1940.1589999999999] rewrite this

[1938.24 - 1942.24] the following

[1940.159 - 1945.5590000000002] premise into

[1942.24 - 1945.559] an outline

[1948.399 - 1952.08] outline all right let's see if this

[1950.24 - 1954.0] works so again i don't know what i'm

[1952.08 - 1956.48] doing here i'm just experimenting rapid

[1954.0 - 1956.48] iteration

[1958.08 - 1961.4399999999998] okay again it's just

[1959.76 - 1963.679] their families rejoice

[1961.44 - 1966.0800000000002] i guess this is okay because then this

[1963.679 - 1968.64] we can break each of these points down

[1966.08 - 1969.84] into we can break them down further

[1968.64 - 1972.3200000000002] um

[1969.84 - 1973.519] and and we can expand the story for each

[1972.32 - 1974.84] of these like

[1973.519 - 1978.0] break this down

[1974.84 - 1981.279] into uh yeah okay

[1978.0 - 1983.679] i mean this these premises are so good

[1981.279 - 1983.679] um

[1984.399 - 1988.4799999999998] yeah okay okay i think i think we can

[1986.96 - 1990.72] work with this i think we can work with

[1988.48 - 1992.48] this also this is probably done

[1990.72 - 1993.6000000000001] um let's go ahead and get this started

[1992.48 - 1995.519] uh

[1993.6 - 1997.519] raj and priya a painter falls in love

[1995.519 - 2000.64] with a girl excellent excellent

[1997.519 - 2003.1200000000001] excellent and that should have us up to

[2000.64 - 2006.0800000000002] was that 45 total

[2003.12 - 2008.799] so we need just a couple more romance

[2006.08 - 2011.519] let's go ahead and set this to run

[2008.799 - 2013.36] um all right imaginary audience in my

[2011.519 - 2016.159] head what kind of romance should we do

[2013.36 - 2018.7199999999998] oh paranormal romance done paranormal

[2016.159 - 2022.64] romance story

[2018.72 - 2025.3600000000001] uh and then we will go from 45

[2022.64 - 2029.279] to 51 so that'll take us all the way up

[2025.36 - 2029.279] to 50. 50 on the dot

[2029.919 - 2035.2] cls

[2031.12 - 2035.1999999999998] python generate some premises

[2042.799 - 2049.119] luke is actually a werewolf that's fun

[2046.96 - 2050.7200000000003] this is great i love this

[2049.119 - 2052.639] um okay this will only take a minute

[2050.72 - 2055.4399999999996] because we're almost done already

[2052.639 - 2055.44] 47.

[2057.76 - 2062.079] jenna is looking jenna looks forward to

[2059.44 - 2062.54] the weekend a lot in gpthree's brain

[2062.079 - 2064.0] um

[2062.54 - 2066.639] [Laughter]

[2064.0 - 2066.639] this is funny

[2069.119 - 2072.639] when you wake up from your car accident

[2070.72 - 2075.04] you find oh this is a first person story

[2072.639 - 2077.839] excellent excellent excellent

[2075.04 - 2078.72] um honestly these premises are so good

[2077.839 - 2080.0] like

[2078.72 - 2081.839] i don't know if i need to break them

[2080.0 - 2083.839] down in any further

[2081.839 - 2084.7999999999997] um

[2083.839 - 2086.399] but

[2084.8 - 2087.599] let's see let me go back to this guy's

[2086.399 - 2089.2] comment

[2087.599 - 2093.599] because maybe maybe this is more of an

[2089.2 - 2094.72] extraction thing um he said

[2093.599 - 2097.28] you know

[2094.72 - 2100.16] setup inciting incident midpoint false

[2097.28 - 2102.32] high all hope is lost and climax

[2100.16 - 2104.0] okay actually you know what dude john

[2102.32 - 2106.32] david parsons i'm just going to copy

[2104.0 - 2107.839] this because this is such a powerful

[2106.32 - 2109.119] way to start

[2107.839 - 2110.72] um let me just

[2109.119 - 2112.2400000000002] paste this in here

[2110.72 - 2114.72] um

[2112.24 - 2116.8799999999997] identify the following

[2114.72 - 2118.7999999999997] elements

[2116.88 - 2120.079] all right just copy that for now let's

[2118.8 - 2122.6400000000003] go back over here

[2120.079 - 2124.8] roman oh wait nope

[2122.64 - 2126.72] brainstorm a detailed plot synopsis for

[2124.8 - 2130.2000000000003] random all right so now we're going to

[2126.72 - 2130.2] switch to

[2132.16 - 2136.64] uh let's see 75

[2134.72 - 2138.9599999999996] actually no we'll say 76.

[2136.64 - 2140.56] um now we're going to switch to

[2138.96 - 2143.88] what did i say sci-fi

[2140.56 - 2143.88] all right sci-fi

[2144.079 - 2148.2400000000002] and we'll say

[2145.76 - 2148.2400000000002] um

[2148.64 - 2152.16] science fiction story

[2152.96 - 2156.839] and then we'll switch that over from

[2154.48 - 2159.28] like science fiction to

[2156.839 - 2161.119] like um

[2159.28 - 2162.7200000000003] actually no let's say

[2161.119 - 2165.52] random hard science fiction and then

[2162.72 - 2167.4399999999996] we'll do like um epic or space opera

[2165.52 - 2170.48] yeah we'll do space opera next okay so

[2167.44 - 2170.48] let's get this running

[2171.52 - 2174.56] uh n a

[2174.8 - 2180.5600000000004] that's interesting

[2177.119 - 2182.7200000000003] did it really just like spit out n a

[2180.56 - 2185.119] it did okay

[2182.72 - 2186.72] gbt3 said no i'm not going to give you a

[2185.119 - 2190.32] premise okay whatever

[2186.72 - 2190.3199999999997] um we'll just delete that one

[2192.48 - 2196.079] and see what it's doing in the future

[2194.64 - 2198.0] the human race has all but wiped out a

[2196.079 - 2199.3590000000004] race of advanced aliens wow we're we're

[2198.0 - 2201.68] jackasses

[2199.359 - 2203.839] um okay

[2201.68 - 2206.48] so we're getting some stories okay

[2203.839 - 2210.119] identify the following elements

[2206.48 - 2210.119] for the premise

[2218.8 - 2222.079] one setup

[2223.28 - 2226.2400000000002] why does it keep jumping all the way

[2224.72 - 2229.839] down

[2226.24 - 2229.839] two inciting incident

[2232.48 - 2236.72] three

[2234.079 - 2236.7200000000003] midpoint

[2239.119 - 2243.6400000000003] four

[2240.24 - 2243.64] false high

[2246.32 - 2250.7200000000003] five

[2247.76 - 2250.7200000000003] all hope is lost

[2251.28 - 2254.8] six

[2252.24 - 2257.68] climax and i will actually probably go

[2254.8 - 2258.96] copy kmylen's storybeat because kmyland

[2257.68 - 2260.72] is pretty good

[2258.96 - 2262.64] okay so one

[2260.72 - 2264.64] um

[2262.64 - 2266.24] setup

[2264.64 - 2267.44] all right let's see if it can identify

[2266.24 - 2270.3199999999997] let's turn the temperature down because

[2267.44 - 2271.599] we don't want it to be as creative now

[2270.32 - 2272.8] we do want it we do want it to be

[2271.599 - 2275.6800000000003] somewhat creative but we don't want it

[2272.8 - 2275.6800000000003] to go off the rails

[2278.96 - 2283.88] okay

[2280.16 - 2283.8799999999997] this looks like it's working

[2285.52 - 2289.52] leaving samir behind i don't know that

[2287.68 - 2291.2] that actually worked

[2289.52 - 2292.56] let's see let's see what happens if we

[2291.2 - 2294.24] turn the temperature down even more and

[2292.56 - 2297.24] i'll try turning it back up in just a

[2294.24 - 2297.24] second

[2302.88 - 2305.2000000000003] okay

[2305.68 - 2309.5989999999997] so again this is just kind of like

[2307.599 - 2311.6800000000003] regurgitating the same

[2309.599 - 2314.1600000000003] um

[2311.68 - 2315.68] there's not really any value add

[2314.16 - 2317.44] that's that's why i'm not so happy with

[2315.68 - 2319.68] this is because these premises are so

[2317.44 - 2321.599] great so it's like okay well what what

[2319.68 - 2322.72] do we do from here

[2321.599 - 2324.7200000000003] um

[2322.72 - 2326.56] i guess i guess i will i will go back

[2324.72 - 2329.5989999999997] and say like okay it can it can be

[2326.56 - 2331.2] helpful if we have a um

[2329.599 - 2332.48] have a good like

[2331.2 - 2335.9199999999996] breakdown

[2332.48 - 2339.4] um but let's see cam while in

[2335.92 - 2339.4] plot beats

[2340.48 - 2344.96] uh what are her

[2342.48 - 2344.96] here we go

[2346.16 - 2349.44] the first act the hook

[2350.24 - 2354.0789999999997] first plot point inciting incident

[2352.16 - 2357.2799999999997] evident key event first half of the

[2354.079 - 2357.28] second act midpoint

[2357.599 - 2361.44] this is not the list that i was thinking

[2360.0 - 2364.64] of because it doesn't include the pinch

[2361.44 - 2366.4] points oh well this is good enough um

[2364.64 - 2368.0] setup and citing incident midpoint falls

[2366.4 - 2369.76] high all hope is lost dark knight is

[2368.0 - 2371.359] soul whatever climax that's fine we'll

[2369.76 - 2373.44] go with this

[2371.359 - 2376.64] all right so temperature of 0.5 let's

[2373.44 - 2376.64] see if it's consistent

[2380.32 - 2383.44] okay so this does break it down into a

[2382.24 - 2384.4799999999996] few points

[2383.44 - 2386.64] um

[2384.48 - 2389.599] we'll go with that for now

[2386.64 - 2392.3199999999997] uh i really think that we should expand

[2389.599 - 2392.32] on this though

[2393.839 - 2396.96] actually here let's let's be more

[2395.68 - 2399.44] creative

[2396.96 - 2401.04] uh okay write

[2399.44 - 2403.119] a detailed

[2401.04 - 2404.8] opening scene

[2403.119 - 2406.4] for a film

[2404.8 - 2408.8] with the following

[2406.4 - 2408.8] premise

[2408.839 - 2417.92] um use let's see what is the standard

[2413.52 - 2417.92] screenplay format called

[2422.4 - 2425.4] okay

[2425.92 - 2428.88] um use

[2427.76 - 2431.92] standard

[2428.88 - 2433.28] script formats

[2431.92 - 2437.16] for

[2433.28 - 2437.1600000000003] hollywood films

[2439.68 - 2442.3999999999996] screenplay

[2445.2 - 2448.7999999999997] let's see what it does with this fade in

[2449.76 - 2453.0] oh wow

[2458.56 - 2461.68] this is it this is fascinating

[2460.0 - 2463.76] screenplay fades in

[2461.68 - 2465.04] exterior of naina's village day we see a

[2463.76 - 2466.6400000000003] small village in the middle of nowhere

[2465.04 - 2468.88] there are simple houses and dirt roads

[2466.64 - 2470.24] we see a young woman naina walking down

[2468.88 - 2472.56] the road she's carrying a small bag and

[2470.24 - 2473.68] looks determined nina to herself this is

[2472.56 - 2475.44] it i'm going to the city and i'm going

[2473.68 - 2477.1189999999997] to make something of myself wow this is

[2475.44 - 2478.88] phenomenal

[2477.119 - 2480.319] oh man okay nina jumps out of the way

[2478.88 - 2481.76] and falls to the ground in anger what

[2480.319 - 2483.7599999999998] the hell the car stops and young man

[2481.76 - 2485.599] sameer gets out he looks apologetic i'm

[2483.76 - 2487.2000000000003] so sorry are you okay i'm fine just

[2485.599 - 2490.079] watch where you're going next time samir

[2487.2 - 2491.9199999999996] nods okay i'm i will i'm really sorry

[2490.079 - 2494.079] waves him off it's fine just be more

[2491.92 - 2495.599] careful

[2494.079 - 2497.8390000000004] um

[2495.599 - 2500.7200000000003] i think it ended because

[2497.839 - 2502.64] ran out of tokens

[2500.72 - 2505.839] uh okay i really like this

[2502.64 - 2507.359] so instead of instead of instead of

[2505.839 - 2508.7999999999997] because the premise is complete we don't

[2507.359 - 2511.359] need we don't need to break that down

[2508.8 - 2514.6400000000003] it's got this is a full story

[2511.359 - 2515.839] um so let's copy this

[2514.64 - 2518.16] and say

[2515.839 - 2520.0] we'll save this as prompt

[2518.16 - 2522.48] screenplay or we'll just call it a

[2520.0 - 2524.079] script

[2522.48 - 2525.52] um okay

[2524.079 - 2528.48] and then if i'm not mistaken this is

[2525.52 - 2530.96] probably done yay

[2528.48 - 2532.88] the year is 20 27 55 the human race has

[2530.96 - 2534.7200000000003] been decimated by a pandemic it swept

[2532.88 - 2538.4] across the globe

[2534.72 - 2539.68] too relevant the year is 20xx

[2538.4 - 2540.56] okay

[2539.68 - 2542.96] um

[2540.56 - 2545.2799999999997] all right cool so we should have up to

[2542.96 - 2546.96] number 75 we got a whole bunch of sci-fi

[2545.28 - 2550.3190000000004] premises

[2546.96 - 2551.92] so let's go back here we'll start at

[2550.319 - 2553.16] 76

[2551.92 - 2555.119] and go to

[2553.16 - 2557.68] 101

[2555.119 - 2560.56] and we're going to change the

[2557.68 - 2561.7599999999998] prompt script what did i say

[2560.56 - 2565.839] or the premise

[2561.76 - 2565.8390000000004] this is going to be a um

[2566.0 - 2570.88] space opera science fiction story

[2568.88 - 2573.04] okay so let's kick this off again while

[2570.88 - 2575.119] it's running in the background

[2573.04 - 2578.2] and that'll be that'll be half of our of

[2575.119 - 2578.2000000000003] our premises

[2583.359 - 2587.68] big jeff is an unlikely hero

[2585.68 - 2589.839] a portly space trader oh man these are

[2587.68 - 2593.1189999999997] great in a galaxy far far away young

[2589.839 - 2595.52] farmer really really it's just copying

[2593.119 - 2597.52] star wars that's fine

[2595.52 - 2598.56] um okay

[2597.52 - 2600.88] so

[2598.56 - 2603.599] we can't expect gbt3 to always be super

[2600.88 - 2605.599] unique but um

[2603.599 - 2607.28] that's fine we don't need it to be so

[2605.599 - 2608.96] this starts to get a little bit more

[2607.28 - 2610.3190000000004] complicated for these prompts so now

[2608.96 - 2612.2400000000002] that we've got material that we want to

[2610.319 - 2613.599] feed in we're going to need to add a few

[2612.24 - 2616.16] more functions

[2613.599 - 2617.6800000000003] and so what i'll do is i'll copy this

[2616.16 - 2620.0] because this script is just for

[2617.68 - 2621.2] generating premises so we'll do is we'll

[2620.0 - 2623.52] save this

[2621.2 - 2628.0] and now we'll say um

[2623.52 - 2630.24] we'll call this generate scripts dot pi

[2628.0 - 2631.44] because we will need to take

[2630.24 - 2634.0789999999997] um

[2631.44 - 2635.839] actually maybe we won't

[2634.079 - 2637.92] uh yeah we will need to take all this

[2635.839 - 2639.599] out because that does too much

[2637.92 - 2641.119] to the um to the thing we need to keep

[2639.599 - 2642.2400000000002] the format

[2641.119 - 2643.839] um

[2642.24 - 2647.1189999999997] we'll need to turn the temperature back

[2643.839 - 2650.4] down i think we're at 0.5 on here yep

[2647.119 - 2651.76] 0.5 we'll keep 500 tokens actually let's

[2650.4 - 2653.76] do a little bit

[2651.76 - 2655.44] more because the screenplay we want we

[2653.76 - 2659.2000000000003] want to expand this

[2655.44 - 2660.88] right um screenplay fade in

[2659.2 - 2663.7599999999998] it doesn't even have a name okay that's

[2660.88 - 2665.76] fine uh but yeah so we need this

[2663.76 - 2667.8390000000004] actually here let's copy this whole

[2665.76 - 2669.76] thing

[2667.839 - 2671.44] and the prompt for the script so then

[2669.76 - 2676.8390000000004] what we do

[2671.44 - 2676.839] is we add a token for the premise

[2680.64 - 2684.7999999999997] okay and we go here

[2685.44 - 2690.4] so um i just want to point out the

[2687.28 - 2692.1600000000003] original idea was to create a um

[2690.4 - 2694.88] was to create a

[2692.16 - 2696.72] outline generator but i realized that

[2694.88 - 2698.8] the the premise generator was more

[2696.72 - 2701.359] powerful than an outline generator

[2698.8 - 2703.04] um and so basically i'm moving the goal

[2701.359 - 2705.04] posts on myself and saying actually

[2703.04 - 2706.96] let's go a little bit further let's do

[2705.04 - 2708.319] something unique um and so we'll do

[2706.96 - 2710.079] scripts

[2708.319 - 2712.16] and so this is going to be the the

[2710.079 - 2714.88] script that um

[2712.16 - 2716.3999999999996] that matches matches what we're doing um

[2714.88 - 2718.2400000000002] we'll leave

[2716.4 - 2720.64] let's change the script write write a

[2718.24 - 2723.4399999999996] detailed opening scene

[2720.64 - 2725.359] um d write

[2723.44 - 2727.599] detailed opening

[2725.359 - 2730.16] scenes plural for a film with the

[2727.599 - 2732.7200000000003] following premise use standard script

[2730.16 - 2735.04] formats for hollywood films so we'll put

[2732.72 - 2738.24] in the premise and then the screenplay

[2735.04 - 2739.52] okay so and then i will also turn um you

[2738.24 - 2741.2] probably saw

[2739.52 - 2743.359] uh generate

[2741.2 - 2744.7999999999997] oh sorry generate scripts turn it up to

[2743.359 - 2746.4] a thousand tokens

[2744.8 - 2748.5600000000004] um

[2746.4 - 2750.079] davinci instruct can go up to four

[2748.56 - 2753.2] thousand

[2750.079 - 2754.88] um so this one so you see like that can

[2753.2 - 2756.48] go up to four thousand that's gonna get

[2754.88 - 2758.2400000000002] pricey and it's also gonna take a while

[2756.48 - 2760.8] so i'm not gonna go that i'm not gonna

[2758.24 - 2762.64] go that far

[2760.8 - 2764.5600000000004] okay this is done kira is a young woman

[2762.64 - 2767.359] born on a small space station

[2764.56 - 2771.2] okay cool so now we should have

[2767.359 - 2773.68] we've got exactly 100 premises

[2771.2 - 2776.48] we've got romance sci-fi what did i say

[2773.68 - 2778.7999999999997] oh fantasy okay so let's go back in here

[2776.48 - 2781.04] and switch to fantasy

[2778.8 - 2783.119] um how long has this video been okay

[2781.04 - 2785.359] we're at 46 minutes

[2783.119 - 2789.4] um and we're we're a good chunk of the

[2785.359 - 2789.4] way done um

[2790.48 - 2793.119] where was i

[2793.2 - 2797.68] oh yeah we are going to

[2795.44 - 2799.52] generate some more premises

[2797.68 - 2800.8799999999997] prompt premise so we're going to switch

[2799.52 - 2803.839] to

[2800.88 - 2805.52] fantasy and we're going to go from

[2803.839 - 2808.64] 101

[2805.52 - 2809.7599999999998] to 126

[2808.64 - 2811.52] and the

[2809.76 - 2814.96] prompt for the premise

[2811.52 - 2814.96] is going to be a random

[2815.04 - 2818.4] high fantasy

[2817.04 - 2821.52] story

[2818.4 - 2822.48] um this one will be specifically

[2821.52 - 2823.92] like

[2822.48 - 2825.92] well it says high fantasy so that

[2823.92 - 2827.52] implies magic and dragons

[2825.92 - 2829.359] um and then we'll do another kind of

[2827.52 - 2833.92] fantasy after this

[2829.359 - 2833.92] all right so let's let that rip and roll

[2834.4 - 2839.119] make sure that it's it runs

[2836.8 - 2841.04] uh the kingdom of alabaster really is in

[2839.119 - 2842.48] peril the king has been assassinated and

[2841.04 - 2844.96] the queen has been kidnapped this is

[2842.48 - 2847.04] this sounds fun far in the land of doran

[2844.96 - 2848.48] there lived a great kingdom people were

[2847.04 - 2850.5589999999997] thriving and happy under the leadership

[2848.48 - 2853.44] of king gelador that's cool

[2850.559 - 2855.3590000000004] um okay the triumphant dorm is restored

[2853.44 - 2857.04] wren a young woman of humble beginnings

[2855.359 - 2858.88] okay this is great

[2857.04 - 2860.64] um a young woman discovers she's

[2858.88 - 2864.7200000000003] recarnated princess of a lost kingdom

[2860.64 - 2865.68] that's cool she must ventures into

[2864.72 - 2866.8799999999997] uh

[2865.68 - 2868.319] yeah okay

[2866.88 - 2871.44] so that's running

[2868.319 - 2873.839] in the meantime generate scripts

[2871.44 - 2875.76] okay so we removed that

[2873.839 - 2878.24] um

[2875.76 - 2881.28] so what we have to do here is instead

[2878.24 - 2883.7599999999998] i'll leave that in place for now

[2881.28 - 2887.4] so we'll do

[2883.76 - 2887.4] import os

[2888.4 - 2893.6800000000003] premises

[2890.0 - 2893.68] equals os lister

[2894.96 - 2899.44] premises

[2897.359 - 2903.68] and so then what we'll do is we'll do

[2899.44 - 2905.599] four premise in premises

[2903.68 - 2907.1189999999997] and also you can do you can do a

[2905.599 - 2909.04] one-liner here

[2907.119 - 2912.4] um actually so let's let's do it that

[2909.04 - 2914.72] way because that's more pythonic

[2912.4 - 2917.599] for premise and premises

[2914.72 - 2919.839] uh we will do

[2917.599 - 2920.96] um

[2919.839 - 2923.839] uh

[2920.96 - 2926.7200000000003] let's see we'll say text equals

[2923.839 - 2930.0] i know with open because we'll use the

[2926.72 - 2932.72] same um

[2930.0 - 2934.559] yeah here we go

[2932.72 - 2937.359] we'll just copy paste this

[2934.559 - 2938.96] but instead we will say

[2937.359 - 2942.24] read

[2938.96 - 2945.04] and we will do

[2942.24 - 2945.04] for file name

[2945.28 - 2949.2000000000003] as

[2946.24 - 2950.4799999999996] in file

[2949.2 - 2953.2] premise

[2950.48 - 2956.16] equals infile dot read okay so now we

[2953.2 - 2957.839] will have loaded each premise

[2956.16 - 2960.48] and then we're going to do

[2957.839 - 2962.0789999999997] the same thing that we did here

[2960.48 - 2963.599] which is

[2962.079 - 2965.28] the uh

[2963.599 - 2968.1600000000003] script

[2965.28 - 2971.1600000000003] equals gpt3 completion

[2968.16 - 2971.16] premise

[2972.0 - 2975.68] um

[2974.319 - 2978.4] oh wait no

[2975.68 - 2980.48] the premi we have more to do um the

[2978.4 - 2982.48] prompt sorry

[2980.48 - 2984.96] with open

[2982.48 - 2987.44] uh let's see what was the prompt name

[2984.96 - 2987.44] there we go

[2988.319 - 2992.16] so this is going to be our prompt

[2990.64 - 2993.44] script

[2992.16 - 2994.8799999999997] and let me check on this see if it's

[2993.44 - 2996.839] done it is done

[2994.88 - 2999.04] okay so let's go

[2996.839 - 3001.839] update and i know i'm jumping around a

[2999.04 - 3003.52] lot but i multitask

[3001.839 - 3005.68] so basically what i'm doing is i notice

[3003.52 - 3007.599] that this is done so i'm going to go

[3005.68 - 3010.48] and update the prompt so this is a

[3007.599 - 3013.52] random high fantasy what other kind of

[3010.48 - 3015.68] fantasies let's do uh grimdark fantasy

[3013.52 - 3021.2] it that's all the rage right now

[3015.68 - 3022.8799999999997] so let's change this from 126 to 151

[3021.2 - 3026.2799999999997] and we'll start that going again

[3022.88 - 3026.28] generate premises

[3029.359 - 3034.5589999999997] and so that just so you can see we've

[3031.44 - 3036.319] got 125 premises here

[3034.559 - 3038.0] um let's see when the last king of the

[3036.319 - 3039.92] realm was slain in battle all hope

[3038.0 - 3042.24] seemed lost but prince aidan heir to the

[3039.92 - 3044.559] throne was not ready to give up

[3042.24 - 3046.319] um okay

[3044.559 - 3047.76] cool life was never meant to be easy

[3046.319 - 3049.52] grown from the dirt and grime of the

[3047.76 - 3053.0400000000004] world the people toiled day in and day

[3049.52 - 3053.04] out yeah this is miserable okay

[3053.599 - 3058.7200000000003] all right where was i generate scripts

[3055.52 - 3062.079] yes generate scripts um so prompt script

[3058.72 - 3064.24] as in file prompt equals infile dot read

[3062.079 - 3067.52] um dot replace and we're going to

[3064.24 - 3068.8799999999997] replace the premise

[3067.52 - 3070.4] with

[3068.88 - 3071.599] the premise

[3070.4 - 3072.8] so that

[3071.599 - 3074.559] grabs that

[3072.8 - 3076.559] so basically we're saying the prompt is

[3074.559 - 3079.0400000000004] going to read

[3076.559 - 3080.8390000000004] this file and replace this part with the

[3079.04 - 3083.359] actual

[3080.839 - 3085.92] premise and so then we will say the

[3083.359 - 3088.0] script equals gpd3 completion of the

[3085.92 - 3090.0] prompt and remember the prompt now has

[3088.0 - 3091.04] the premise embedded

[3090.0 - 3092.72] um

[3091.04 - 3095.44] and so then

[3092.72 - 3098.3999999999996] that is the call to gpt3

[3095.44 - 3098.4] file name

[3099.04 - 3103.52] um actually the file name will just be

[3104.079 - 3110.8] file name equals

[3107.119 - 3113.44] we'll say new file name equals filename

[3110.8 - 3114.8] dot replace

[3113.44 - 3116.48] premise

[3114.8 - 3118.8] with script

[3116.48 - 3120.319] so basically what this line will do

[3118.8 - 3122.88] is it will grab

[3120.319 - 3124.319] the premise and just say script and it

[3122.88 - 3125.92] will have the same otherwise it'll have

[3124.319 - 3128.8] the same number

[3125.92 - 3130.559] um okay so that'll be the new file name

[3128.8 - 3132.6400000000003] that's fine

[3130.559 - 3134.88] and then we will we'll copy paste this

[3132.64 - 3134.8799999999997] line

[3137.2 - 3142.319] um with open and we'll say scripts so

[3140.24 - 3144.8799999999997] this will change to a new file

[3142.319 - 3148.96] out file right

[3144.88 - 3151.76] so new file name and we'll say script

[3148.96 - 3153.44] right there so that should be good

[3151.76 - 3158.2400000000002] and we'll do

[3153.44 - 3158.2400000000002] exit 0 just to test the first one

[3160.64 - 3165.0] and so this should be ready

[3166.4 - 3171.92] once uh as soon as as soon as we've got

[3168.559 - 3173.6800000000003] enough training data so tell you what um

[3171.92 - 3175.2000000000003] this is about as far as i can code right

[3173.68 - 3177.44] now so i'm gonna pause the video and

[3175.2 - 3179.1189999999997] skip ahead but basically all i'm gonna

[3177.44 - 3181.28] do is make sure

[3179.119 - 3183.28] that um

[3181.28 - 3184.96] that this finishes creating the

[3183.28 - 3187.8390000000004] underlying data and then i'll i'll

[3184.96 - 3189.44] restart the video once we are once we're

[3187.839 - 3191.2] ready to start generating the scripts

[3189.44 - 3196.079] all right pause

[3191.2 - 3198.48] okay as promised we have 200 premises um

[3196.079 - 3199.599] a bunch of them i did a i did a gritty

[3198.48 - 3202.88] noir

[3199.599 - 3205.04] mystery anime uh was one of them but

[3202.88 - 3207.28] we've got 200

[3205.04 - 3210.5589999999997] all kinds of we got mystery fantasy

[3207.28 - 3213.6800000000003] sci-fi and romance and they're all great

[3210.559 - 3214.88] okay so next up let's do a quick

[3213.68 - 3218.72] test

[3214.88 - 3220.48] python generate scripts okay so as a

[3218.72 - 3223.4399999999996] reminder we did

[3220.48 - 3226.64] this premise of the um

[3223.44 - 3227.92] uh or the script premise sorry

[3226.64 - 3229.839] re reset

[3227.92 - 3232.319] we have a script writer that uses the

[3229.839 - 3234.64] premises we just made okay there we go

[3232.319 - 3237.04] that's what i was trying to say so let's

[3234.64 - 3238.96] do this let's just generate one to make

[3237.04 - 3240.24] sure it works and then if that works i'm

[3238.96 - 3241.44] going to pause the video again while it

[3240.24 - 3244.16] runs because you don't want to sit here

[3241.44 - 3246.16] and just watch 200 go alright so

[3244.16 - 3249.1189999999997] generate scripts

[3246.16 - 3251.68] let's see if this throws any errors

[3249.119 - 3253.76] and if it doesn't let's check to make

[3251.68 - 3256.24] sure that it outputs correctly oh i

[3253.76 - 3258.7200000000003] didn't have it do any console output

[3256.24 - 3261.2799999999997] um script one hey look at this shannon's

[3258.72 - 3262.64] farm shannon early 20s shannon look at

[3261.28 - 3265.8390000000004] this perfect

[3262.64 - 3267.839] okay this is 1400 lines long or

[3265.839 - 3269.359] characters long so that's

[3267.839 - 3273.2799999999997] uh that's probably right about a

[3269.359 - 3275.44] thousand tokens um yeah this is great

[3273.28 - 3278.3190000000004] okay so i'm gonna pause the video again

[3275.44 - 3280.079] while this runs and i'll see you in just

[3278.319 - 3284.4] a second

[3280.079 - 3286.559] okay and we're back um we've got

[3284.4 - 3288.64] almost 200 scripts written

[3286.559 - 3290.96] so you can just see like hey here's some

[3288.64 - 3292.5589999999997] actual scripts being generated i'm not

[3290.96 - 3294.2400000000002] going to read them all but i'm just

[3292.559 - 3296.48] going to trust that like hey this works

[3294.24 - 3297.68] and if you want to go through it

[3296.48 - 3299.599] and um

[3297.68 - 3301.359] and take a look at them um in the

[3299.599 - 3303.76] meantime though while this was running

[3301.359 - 3305.359] because this has taken let's see 8 22

[3303.76 - 3307.119] now i don't know when it paused you can

[3305.359 - 3309.04] do some math

[3307.119 - 3310.96] but i think i started

[3309.04 - 3312.88] about an hour and a half ago now total

[3310.96 - 3314.96] maybe a little bit more

[3312.88 - 3316.1600000000003] so hour and a half later

[3314.96 - 3317.839] most of this time has actually been

[3316.16 - 3319.5989999999997] spent waiting because this is this is a

[3317.839 - 3322.0] slow process

[3319.599 - 3324.2400000000002] okay so we've got that so what i did it

[3322.0 - 3325.92] while i was waiting so we've got the

[3324.24 - 3327.9199999999996] generate premises we're done with that

[3325.92 - 3329.28] generate the prompt for the premises

[3327.92 - 3330.64] we've got that

[3329.28 - 3332.3190000000004] oh let me zoom back in sorry you

[3330.64 - 3334.48] probably can't see this

[3332.319 - 3336.48] generate scripts you saw me write this

[3334.48 - 3338.559] this works just fine

[3336.48 - 3340.4] you can see the results here

[3338.559 - 3342.2400000000002] um

[3340.4 - 3343.2000000000003] and then whoops

[3342.24 - 3344.9599999999996] and then

[3343.2 - 3348.16] uh okay so this is the next thing i did

[3344.96 - 3349.92] i borrowed this from a previous

[3348.16 - 3351.92] previous project so all this does is

[3349.92 - 3354.4] create a json l file

[3351.92 - 3356.96] so let me do python

[3354.4 - 3358.799] generate json l

[3356.96 - 3361.28] name data is not defined what do you

[3358.799 - 3362.96] mean data is not defined

[3361.28 - 3364.6400000000003] um

[3362.96 - 3366.64] where do i use data

[3364.64 - 3369.1189999999997] oh

[3366.64 - 3371.359] i meant to delete that

[3369.119 - 3371.359] okay

[3373.119 - 3378.0] okay so let's make sure that this

[3375.28 - 3380.88] file was good

[3378.0 - 3383.44] scripts.jsonl

[3380.88 - 3384.799] cool so it looks like that worked so

[3383.44 - 3387.68] prompt

[3384.799 - 3390.48] and then it ends with completion

[3387.68 - 3392.799] you see here where i have nnn script so

[3390.48 - 3393.44] what i always do is i always add

[3392.799 - 3396.079] a

[3393.44 - 3399.2000000000003] natural language token at the end openai

[3396.079 - 3401.04] they recommend doing something like

[3399.2 - 3403.4399999999996] that as your divider but i don't like

[3401.04 - 3405.04] doing that it doesn't work as well

[3403.44 - 3407.76] because if you have a natural language

[3405.04 - 3408.799] token at the end of the prompt then it

[3407.76 - 3411.119] knows

[3408.799 - 3414.16] um it knows like okay now it's time to

[3411.119 - 3416.96] do this particular task

[3414.16 - 3419.2799999999997] so what this data looks like is it what

[3416.96 - 3421.04] it does let me explain this um so we

[3419.28 - 3423.0400000000004] take the premise

[3421.04 - 3425.7599999999998] and we match it

[3423.04 - 3428.64] to a pr uh sorry a script

[3425.76 - 3431.119] and so this script shannon's farm on the

[3428.64 - 3433.5989999999997] day like da da shannon is left to a

[3431.119 - 3436.0] family farm on her own so basically this

[3433.599 - 3437.119] this is going to train a model

[3436.0 - 3439.119] to take

[3437.119 - 3441.52] any any premise so this could be like a

[3439.119 - 3442.48] handwritten premise and output a movie

[3441.52 - 3444.559] script

[3442.48 - 3445.92] um i know it completely changed the

[3444.559 - 3447.52] purpose from what i said at the

[3445.92 - 3449.599] beginning of the video but hey that's

[3447.52 - 3450.799] how rapid prototyping and research goes

[3449.599 - 3452.319] let me save that because i don't want to

[3450.799 - 3453.44] or close that because i don't want to

[3452.319 - 3455.04] save it okay

[3453.44 - 3456.7200000000003] so this

[3455.04 - 3458.48] file worked

[3456.72 - 3460.5589999999997] so we've got our we've got our json l

[3458.48 - 3463.68] file so this is the final product for

[3460.559 - 3465.6800000000003] our training data and then the very last

[3463.68 - 3470.319] script that i wrote is this fine tune

[3465.68 - 3471.7599999999998] dot pi and again excuse me i um

[3470.319 - 3473.92] i

[3471.76 - 3475.44] borrowed it from a previous one so

[3473.92 - 3477.92] basically all it does

[3475.44 - 3479.68] is it uploads the file the json l file

[3477.92 - 3482.16] that we just did

[3479.68 - 3483.52] and then it calls the fine tune model

[3482.16 - 3485.44] and i'll pause it again because the fine

[3483.52 - 3487.359] tuning takes a while to show you but

[3485.44 - 3489.119] then once it's done it'll actually

[3487.359 - 3490.96] appear

[3489.119 - 3493.359] oh and so just so you know how much this

[3490.96 - 3494.96] cost let me do a quick refresh

[3493.359 - 3496.72] so everything that you've seen today i

[3494.96 - 3498.319] started the day at about two dollars so

[3496.72 - 3500.16] now we're at 11

[3498.319 - 3502.5589999999997] so generating

[3500.16 - 3505.359] generating 200 premises

[3502.559 - 3507.6800000000003] which is let's see that's about 139

[3505.359 - 3510.16] kilobytes of text data

[3507.68 - 3512.359] um and then generating 200 scripts from

[3510.16 - 3516.3999999999996] those which is going to be a lot more

[3512.359 - 3518.72] 330 or 303 kilobytes so

[3516.4 - 3520.079] this all told was cost about nine

[3518.72 - 3521.7599999999998] dollars so far because i was at about

[3520.079 - 3523.119] two dollars already when i got started

[3521.76 - 3526.2400000000002] this morning

[3523.119 - 3528.2400000000002] um yeah so nine dollars to generate um

[3526.24 - 3530.16] to to synthesize the data that's that's

[3528.24 - 3532.319] not just the fine tuning the fine tuning

[3530.16 - 3533.5989999999997] is way cheaper but this was synthesizing

[3532.319 - 3536.319] from scratch

[3533.599 - 3537.2000000000003] okay so i think this should be ready

[3536.319 - 3539.359] um

[3537.2 - 3542.16] so let's see file upload

[3539.359 - 3544.64] that does do the pretty print of that

[3542.16 - 3546.3999999999996] and then the fine fine-tune model

[3544.64 - 3549.1189999999997] um

[3546.4 - 3551.04] okay so yes this should work

[3549.119 - 3552.6400000000003] if i'm not mistaken it might error out

[3551.04 - 3555.92] so let's do cls

[3552.64 - 3555.92] python find two

[3556.839 - 3564.0] fine-tune okay got the file uploaded

[3561.359 - 3564.0] and

[3564.48 - 3567.04] let's see

[3567.359 - 3573.2] status pending okay cool

[3570.64 - 3576.0789999999997] i think this is usually usually it's in

[3573.2 - 3578.16] in sequential order so davinci fine tune

[3576.079 - 3579.599] file name file

[3578.16 - 3581.5989999999997] um

[3579.599 - 3584.6400000000003] it doesn't have the name in it anyways

[3581.599 - 3587.44] i'm assuming that it is fine tuning um

[3584.64 - 3589.68] let's do

[3587.44 - 3591.28] fine tune get fine tune list okay so

[3589.68 - 3594.16] here we will

[3591.28 - 3594.1600000000003] uh let me

[3594.559 - 3597.52] oh yeah so that was the last thing it

[3595.92 - 3599.44] did let me save that real quick so i

[3597.52 - 3601.52] just comment these two out i actually

[3599.44 - 3604.319] don't need that

[3601.52 - 3604.319] so let me just do

[3604.64 - 3607.92] cls

[3605.839 - 3609.68] so fine tune all this will do is just do

[3607.92 - 3611.2000000000003] a fine tune list

[3609.68 - 3613.52] so it's pending okay this will take a

[3611.2 - 3614.64] while so i'll pause the video again

[3613.52 - 3617.119] pause the record because you don't want

[3614.64 - 3620.0] to just sit and wait for this to finish

[3617.119 - 3621.28] but let me show you what it looks like

[3620.0 - 3623.839] when it's done

[3621.28 - 3626.6400000000003] um so when it's done the under your

[3623.839 - 3628.48] engines your fine tunes will pop up here

[3626.64 - 3629.7599999999998] and it'll have so it starts with the

[3628.48 - 3632.4] engine name

[3629.76 - 3634.2400000000002] um and then they changed it so it's like

[3632.4 - 3636.1600000000003] the original fine tunes were like user

[3634.24 - 3638.4799999999996] blah blah blah blah this wasn't helpful

[3636.16 - 3641.44] they changed it to the name so it gives

[3638.48 - 3643.599] me my name and then i gave it a tag so

[3641.44 - 3644.64] this was my eve project

[3643.599 - 3646.559] um

[3644.64 - 3648.799] yep so on and so forth core objective

[3646.559 - 3650.079] functions eve so on and so forth so once

[3648.799 - 3652.079] that's done

[3650.079 - 3653.119] another fine tune will pop up here with

[3652.079 - 3656.559] the name

[3653.119 - 3657.92] um what name did i give it scripts um

[3656.559 - 3659.3590000000004] so that i could i could have said

[3657.92 - 3660.2400000000002] something better like movie script or

[3659.359 - 3663.52] something

[3660.24 - 3665.839] um but yeah so that's pretty much it

[3663.52 - 3667.599] um let me pause it and i'll show you

[3665.839 - 3669.68] what how this performs in the playground

[3667.599 - 3672.96] in just a moment

[3669.68 - 3675.44] okay gang and we are done it's uh nine

[3672.96 - 3677.52] o'clock so i think that's about two and

[3675.44 - 3679.52] a half hours in granted a huge chunk of

[3677.52 - 3682.24] this was waiting

[3679.52 - 3683.52] um so let me do a quick refresh here

[3682.24 - 3685.4399999999996] and let me show you what the final

[3683.52 - 3686.799] result is

[3685.44 - 3688.7200000000003] um whoops

[3686.799 - 3692.72] scroll down

[3688.72 - 3695.359] um scripts okay so um

[3692.72 - 3696.9599999999996] oh let's come up with a random premise

[3695.359 - 3698.5589999999997] for a story

[3696.96 - 3700.96] uh

[3698.559 - 3702.799] actually here my creativity is offline

[3700.96 - 3704.319] so let me just go back up here

[3702.799 - 3706.559] write

[3704.319 - 3708.64] a premise for

[3706.559 - 3709.8390000000004] um oh let's combine it so we have an

[3708.64 - 3712.5589999999997] anime

[3709.839 - 3715.2799999999997] um an anime mystery and a high fantasy

[3712.559 - 3716.48] so let's do write a premise for a high

[3715.28 - 3718.88] fantasy

[3716.48 - 3722.4] anime movie

[3718.88 - 3727.28] write a detailed premise

[3722.4 - 3729.2000000000003] uh let's go brainstorm okay

[3727.28 - 3730.96] in a world of swords and sorcery a young

[3729.2 - 3732.96] girl named lily is thrust into a quest

[3730.96 - 3734.88] to save her kingdom from a powerful evil

[3732.96 - 3738.64] sorcerer okay great

[3734.88 - 3740.799] okay we've got a premise so let's

[3738.64 - 3742.96] oops clear that out

[3740.799 - 3744.16] in a world of swords and sorcery

[3742.96 - 3747.2] and then

[3744.16 - 3749.5989999999997] the um the fine tuning data adds this

[3747.2 - 3751.2] uh this script so that tells it that the

[3749.599 - 3753.2000000000003] the premise is done

[3751.2 - 3756.799] so we'll go down to scripts and we'll

[3753.2 - 3758.72] change this to 0.5

[3756.799 - 3760.88] and here we go let's see what happens it

[3758.72 - 3762.72] might timeout because

[3760.88 - 3766.079] it does often take a little bit of extra

[3762.72 - 3768.0789999999997] time to load a fine-tuned model

[3766.079 - 3770.079] but we should be just about done and to

[3768.079 - 3771.119] prove it let me go back

[3770.079 - 3773.119] here

[3771.119 - 3774.96] and show you

[3773.119 - 3776.96] outline generators so

[3774.96 - 3778.319] started three hours ago

[3776.96 - 3779.76] um

[3778.319 - 3781.68] yeah so three hours ago that's about how

[3779.76 - 3782.88] long i've been working on this and we

[3781.68 - 3785.2799999999997] will

[3782.88 - 3786.6400000000003] do a final commit and i'll do a final

[3785.28 - 3788.799] push

[3786.64 - 3790.319] yep please try again shortly

[3788.799 - 3792.799] actually i'm not changing anything so

[3790.319 - 3796.4] we'll just do ahead get status so

[3792.799 - 3798.4] remember i started this video with um

[3796.4 - 3800.7200000000003] with just doing this get

[3798.4 - 3802.96] the initial commit get

[3800.72 - 3805.4399999999996] add all

[3802.96 - 3806.96] get commit

[3805.44 - 3809.359] am

[3806.96 - 3812.079] final commit and you can go check on the

[3809.359 - 3813.92] um the commits yourself if you want get

[3812.079 - 3816.4] push

[3813.92 - 3818.559] okay so this code is now updated and

[3816.4 - 3819.92] online i'm probably also going to rename

[3818.559 - 3822.079] it from outline generator because this

[3819.92 - 3823.76] has actually became a script generator

[3822.079 - 3826.1600000000003] um

[3823.76 - 3828.079] why did it name it that

[3826.16 - 3831.2] oh i probably accidentally copy pasted

[3828.079 - 3835.039] that didn't i that shouldn't be there

[3831.2 - 3835.0389999999998] cof jsonl

[3835.68 - 3840.319] yeah i totally accidentally copy pasted

[3837.52 - 3842.64] that okay that needs to go away um also

[3840.319 - 3845.119] this is under the mit license so you are

[3842.64 - 3846.8799999999997] free to use this however you want

[3845.119 - 3848.7200000000003] um

[3846.88 - 3852.44] let's see if this is loaded still being

[3848.72 - 3852.4399999999996] loaded try again

[3854.559 - 3858.7200000000003] um

[3855.839 - 3859.44] get status get add

[3858.72 - 3862.0789999999997] get

[3859.44 - 3864.0] commit am removing

[3862.079 - 3866.6400000000003] extraneous oh actually there's another

[3864.0 - 3868.0] one that needs to be removed um

[3866.64 - 3869.1189999999997] brainstorm because we didn't use that

[3868.0 - 3870.48] one

[3869.119 - 3871.76] okay

[3870.48 - 3873.599] get add

[3871.76 - 3876.1600000000003] git commit am

[3873.599 - 3879.599] remove extra files keep it as simple as

[3876.16 - 3879.5989999999997] possible get push

[3880.079 - 3882.319] okay

[3882.799 - 3886.96] cool so now the only stuff in this is

[3884.96 - 3888.4] exactly what was used nothing more

[3886.96 - 3891.2] nothing less
