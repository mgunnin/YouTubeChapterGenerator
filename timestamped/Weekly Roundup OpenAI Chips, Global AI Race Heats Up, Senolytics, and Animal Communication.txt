[0.28 - 5.48] happy Friday everyone as has been true

[3.56 - 7.52] every week for this year it's been an

[5.48 - 9.88] exciting week in the world of artificial

[7.52 - 12.599] intelligence and the fourth Industrial

[9.88 - 16.16] Revolution so today's breakdown is going

[12.599 - 18.439] to cover five main topics uh open AI

[16.16 - 20.519] they've got a new announcement regarding

[18.439 - 22.68] making their own chips as well as

[20.519 - 24.839999999999996] caching and a stateful API we'll unpack

[22.68 - 26.84] that in just a moment I've also got some

[24.84 - 28.08] news about the global AI arms race

[26.84 - 29.8] heating up there's been some really

[28.08 - 32.199999999999996] interesting developments and I'll do a

[29.8 - 33.559] uh kind of a deep dive analysis on that

[32.2 - 35.800000000000004] so that you kind of understand the

[33.559 - 38.239] trends that I'm seeing and that I'm

[35.8 - 40.399] paying attention to that uh cause me a

[38.239 - 42.44] little bit of concern uh there's been

[40.399 - 45.2] some breakthrough research on senescent

[42.44 - 46.76] cells so this is a longevity topic uh

[45.2 - 48.36] We've also had some more AI

[46.76 - 50.599999999999994] breakthroughs talking with animals so

[48.36 - 52.96] I'll unpack that a little bit and then

[50.6 - 55.039] finally we will talk about ongoing job

[52.96 - 59.239000000000004] destruction around the world due to

[55.039 - 62.84] artificial intelligence so first up is

[59.239 - 64.84] uh open AI working on uh possibly

[62.84 - 68.88000000000001] building their own chips now one thing

[64.84 - 71.08] is uh I read the article is even if they

[68.88 - 73.439] do start making their own chips it will

[71.08 - 74.96] take a little while uh whether they're

[73.439 - 76.83999999999999] designing it or setting up their own

[74.96 - 80.19999999999999] Fabs they've also looked at potentially

[76.84 - 81.759] acquiring companies in order to uh kind

[80.2 - 84.759] of get a jump start on creating their

[81.759 - 86.07900000000001] own AI chips now this is nothing new

[84.759 - 88.6] this is what's called vertical

[86.079 - 90.67999999999999] integration and this is actually one of

[88.6 - 93.67999999999999] uh one of the it's not Innovation it's

[90.68 - 96.43900000000001] nothing it's nothing that is like unique

[93.68 - 98.43900000000001] or anything but vertical integration has

[96.439 - 101.32] become much more popular in the tech

[98.439 - 104.79899999999999] space particularly after uh people

[101.32 - 107.119] seeing the success of Tesla and SpaceX

[104.799 - 109.04] so what you might not realize is one of

[107.119 - 111.32] the reasons that space flight is so

[109.04 - 114.2] incredibly expensive is because of

[111.32 - 116.39899999999999] enormous uh supply lines and you know

[114.2 - 118.159] Parts being made all over the place and

[116.399 - 121.039] so one of the things that Elon Musk did

[118.159 - 122.60000000000001] in terms of making space cheaper is

[121.039 - 124.92] vertical integration so vertical

[122.6 - 127.36] integration means that uh rather than

[124.92 - 130.479] buying a part uh from outside of the

[127.36 - 132.8] company you build it all inhouse and so

[130.479 - 134.84] this makes sense this actually kind of

[132.8 - 137.0] runs contrary to business Theory and

[134.84 - 139.84] business philosophy particularly in the

[137.0 - 142.08] 70s and 80s as uh as Logistics became

[139.84 - 143.8] more sophisticated it it was more about

[142.08 - 146.12] Outsourcing and so instead of

[143.8 - 148.87900000000002] Outsourcing now we're insourcing and

[146.12 - 151.959] onshoring uh so this this move doesn't

[148.879 - 154.35999999999999] surprise me and I suspect that uh as

[151.959 - 156.4] these uh resources become more and more

[154.36 - 158.4] commoditized uh we're basically going to

[156.4 - 160.59900000000002] eventually see AI chips just like any

[158.4 - 163.76000000000002] other processor which is actually why

[160.599 - 166.28] companies like IBM sold off their entire

[163.76 - 168.92] server and laptop unit because computers

[166.28 - 171.92] are are seen as Commodities

[168.92 - 174.72] now so moving forward uh and directly

[171.92 - 178.11999999999998] relevant to this is the global AI arms

[174.72 - 180.599] race so this news was it's a little bit

[178.12 - 184.08] understated but to me

[180.599 - 189.0] uh this move by some Southeast Asian uh

[184.08 - 190.36] countries really um it kind of I'm I'm

[189.0 - 192.64] not saying that this is a warning shot

[190.36 - 194.92000000000002] it's not a shot across the bow um this

[192.64 - 200.92] is just it kind of makes sense so the

[194.92 - 203.72] tldr here is that uh the the aan the as

[200.92 - 206.44] asan uh Nations which is kind of like

[203.72 - 208.879] the EU but for Southeast Asia not

[206.44 - 211.07999999999998] exactly one for one but you get the idea

[208.879 - 213.0] um the idea a here is that they are

[211.08 - 214.959] taking a more business friendly kind of

[213.0 - 217.439] more libertarian approach to AI

[214.959 - 221.04] regulation so that's the hands-off

[217.439 - 222.84] regulation uh which runs very contrary

[221.04 - 224.35999999999999] to what the EU is doing and of course

[222.84 - 227.959] like there's been some push back against

[224.36 - 229.64000000000001] the EU AI act because it was uh it was

[227.959 - 232.239] pretty strict in terms of Consumer

[229.64 - 235.07899999999998] Protections I tend to agree with that

[232.239 - 238.31900000000002] however in the grand scheme of things

[235.079 - 240.68] you know yes with global economics you

[238.319 - 243.07899999999998] can use sanctions and other diplomatic

[240.68 - 245.28] things in order to try and coers uh

[243.079 - 248.43900000000002] other nations or other blocks of Nations

[245.28 - 250.64000000000001] into uh cooperating but in the grand

[248.439 - 253.439] scheme of things this is a global scale

[250.64 - 256.919] game of geopolitical economic scientific

[253.439 - 259.15999999999997] and technological chess and the writings

[256.919 - 261.44] on the wall as everyone knows today at

[259.16 - 263.28000000000003] least almost everyone knows and agrees

[261.44 - 265.919] uh obviously there's some holdouts but

[263.28 - 267.84] in general it is understood that the

[265.919 - 270.56] countries and companies that move

[267.84 - 273.75899999999996] fastest and furthest on AI will have a

[270.56 - 276.639] distinct Advantage not just economically

[273.759 - 279.759] but socially and militarily so there is

[276.639 - 281.16] no incentive for countries to slow down

[279.759 - 283.40000000000003] and this is what I and others have been

[281.16 - 284.91900000000004] saying since the the infamous pause

[283.4 - 287.56] letter came out what was it almost six

[284.919 - 290.0] months ago already seems like yesterday

[287.56 - 292.6] um but you know and it's like we knew

[290.0 - 295.8] that that was a failed idea like you

[292.6 - 297.36] cannot slow this down um and you know

[295.8 - 299.0] private Enterprise they're going to do

[297.36 - 300.199] what's in their best interest militaries

[299.0 - 301.759] are going to do what's in their best

[300.199 - 303.8] interest governments are going to do

[301.759 - 305.759] what's in their best interest so it's

[303.8 - 308.68] basically like you know strap in get

[305.759 - 310.56] ready for blastoff we are all along for

[308.68 - 312.52] the ride when this is actually a big

[310.56 - 315.08] component of my research because my

[312.52 - 318.19899999999996] assertion as other people uh are coming

[315.08 - 320.96] to realize is you can't stop this you

[318.199 - 322.91900000000004] can't have some high-minded ideal like

[320.96 - 324.84] uh what some of the CEOs are saying like

[322.919 - 326.88] oh well we should never make it agentic

[324.84 - 329.31899999999996] or you know we should do this that or

[326.88 - 331.319] the no you have to assume that this is a

[329.319 - 333.36] uh an imperfect environment a highly

[331.319 - 336.47900000000004] competitive environment where basically

[333.36 - 338.16] anything goes and so in that case

[336.479 - 340.08] basically you're stuck in what I call

[338.16 - 342.16] terminal race condition which is you're

[340.08 - 345.19899999999996] trying to optimize for Speed as much as

[342.16 - 346.8] anything else and other people call it a

[345.199 - 348.72] race for the bottom it's not necessarily

[346.8 - 350.44] a race for the bottom because there are

[348.72 - 352.52000000000004] also advantages to being smart and

[350.44 - 354.8] ethical the smarter and more ethical

[352.52 - 356.56] your AI is the more trustworthy it is

[354.8 - 357.91900000000004] and the less oversight it requires I've

[356.56 - 360.4] talked about this in some of my recent

[357.919 - 362.24] videos where putting effort into lying

[360.4 - 366.479] and being deceptive that is all wasted

[362.24 - 369.319] effort in my opinion so uh pay attention

[366.479 - 371.56] to how uh things play out between you

[369.319 - 374.24] know it seems like the the the three

[371.56 - 376.88] primary centers of gravity for AI is

[374.24 - 378.8] America Europe and Asia uh which of

[376.88 - 381.24] course like that's most of the world I'm

[378.8 - 384.40000000000003] just excluding like the global South uh

[381.24 - 386.12] from that but anyways point being is

[384.4 - 388.28] that um this is a really interesting

[386.12 - 391.199] development it's not surprising but it

[388.28 - 393.63899999999995] is still concerning and it's to watch uh

[391.199 - 396.08000000000004] more specifically uh as you may or may

[393.639 - 398.96000000000004] not remember earlier this year the Biden

[396.08 - 402.0] Administration placed a pretty heavy uh

[398.96 - 405.56] trade embargo uh a on AI chips going to

[402.0 - 407.479] China and there has this is again it's

[405.56 - 409.919] not too surprising but there's been some

[407.479 - 412.44] push back from the big uh silicon uh

[409.919 - 414.15999999999997] players Nvidia Intel and Qualcomm

[412.44 - 416.28] they're pushing back on that now because

[414.16 - 418.44] they're saying you know well here let me

[416.28 - 420.0] just give you the summary first uh

[418.44 - 421.879] cutting sales to China

[420.0 - 423.72] obviously if you can't sell to someone

[421.879 - 425.319] that's bad for business this is part of

[423.72 - 428.639] the globalist policy that's been into

[425.319 - 431.599] place since uh the 1970s and 1980s which

[428.639 - 433.639] is uh you know economic interdependence

[431.599 - 435.8] uh reduces your chances of going to war

[433.639 - 437.199] with people because if they have Goods

[435.8 - 439.0] that they buy from you and goods that

[437.199 - 441.44] you buy from them you don't want to

[439.0 - 443.479] shoot yourself in the foot and so trade

[441.44 - 445.039] embargos particularly with gigantic

[443.479 - 447.639] trading partners like between America

[445.039 - 449.36] and China generally it's a lose lose

[447.639 - 451.56] situation but you do that for

[449.36 - 455.879] geopolitical and Military

[451.56 - 457.16] reasons uh now another thing is uh and

[455.879 - 459.28000000000003] this is actually kind of surprising

[457.16 - 461.56] because some people predicted this and

[459.28 - 463.599] of course China is incredibly adaptive

[461.56 - 465.52] so like I think it was like literally

[463.599 - 468.8] within days of the Embargo being

[465.52 - 470.68] announced China internally announced

[468.8 - 472.44] that they were going to say okay well

[470.68 - 474.639] we're just we'll just develop our own

[472.44 - 477.28] internal expertise our own internal

[474.639 - 479.40000000000003] fabri uh you know chip Fabs and we won't

[477.28 - 482.55999999999995] need you so they're like take a hike we

[479.4 - 484.599] don't care um so you know there's

[482.56 - 486.639] there's many possible unintended

[484.599 - 489.71999999999997] consequences and intended consequences

[486.639 - 491.24] from the uh chip embargo going to China

[489.72 - 493.28000000000003] but you know

[491.24 - 494.52] basically if you cut someone off and

[493.28 - 497.63899999999995] then they have to develop their own

[494.52 - 499.479] internal expertise that is a chance for

[497.639 - 503.52] them to then kind of say well we don't

[499.479 - 505.639] need you anyways however uh despite uh

[503.52 - 507.0] you know so for instance what I'm one

[505.639 - 510.08] thing that I'm thinking about is a few

[507.0 - 512.2] years ago Vladimir Putin in Russia said

[510.08 - 513.88] you know the company or the country that

[512.2 - 516.279] you know dominates AI will dominate the

[513.88 - 519.64] world something like that I know I'm

[516.279 - 521.479] misquoting it uh but basically despite

[519.64 - 523.64] knowing the value of that and despite

[521.479 - 526.72] having literally hundreds of billions of

[523.64 - 529.0] dollars um to invest Russia was never

[526.72 - 531.44] able to develop the internal expertise

[529.0 - 533.64] to catch up or compete on the global

[531.44 - 535.9590000000001] stage with respect to artificial

[533.64 - 537.8] intelligence now that being said China

[535.959 - 539.8] is far more organized and far richer

[537.8 - 542.079] than Russia so if they set their mind to

[539.8 - 543.92] it it's entirely possible that yeah

[542.079 - 544.8389999999999] cutting off trade with China means that

[543.92 - 547.92] they're just going to have their own

[544.839 - 550.6800000000001] little isolated island of AI expertise

[547.92 - 553.279] and it it in the worst case scenario it

[550.68 - 555.3599999999999] will be like a new Cold War where you

[553.279 - 557.64] know the Soviets were developing Science

[555.36 - 561.92] and Technology independent of and

[557.64 - 562.92] parallel to the West uh and and so this

[561.92 - 565.399] there's actually a lot of people that

[562.92 - 568.16] are predicting that we might end up in

[565.399 - 570.36] in like segmented internet world again

[568.16 - 571.88] um which that would be interesting one

[570.36 - 573.2] way or another I'm not I don't actually

[571.88 - 576.12] know whether or not that's a good thing

[573.2 - 578.2] or a bad thing until we learn to come

[576.12 - 581.24] together as a global species one of my

[578.2 - 583.24] long-term goals is to uh is to help

[581.24 - 585.279] steer Humanity towards Utopia and part

[583.24 - 587.6800000000001] of what I view as utopia obviously

[585.279 - 590.48] there's different uh definitions of this

[587.68 - 593.3599999999999] but I think we can all generally agree

[590.48 - 595.839] that like world peace is a good idea um

[593.36 - 598.04] and part of part of world peace is open

[595.839 - 600.9200000000001] communication so I I think that

[598.04 - 603.64] segmented internet and and having you

[600.92 - 605.279] know different different uh hemispheres

[603.64 - 606.56] of the world having fundamentally

[605.279 - 610.399] different approaches to artificial

[606.56 - 612.68] intelligence and Ai and internet would

[610.399 - 615.76] probably be a bad thing in the long

[612.68 - 617.8] run okay so moving right along this news

[615.76 - 619.56] comes I think uh yesterday or the day

[617.8 - 622.76] before and I didn't pay too much

[619.56 - 624.5999999999999] attention to it at first but uh some of

[622.76 - 626.04] my some of my patreon supporters were

[624.6 - 628.0790000000001] talking about it and so I gave it a

[626.04 - 629.36] second look and it's it's a it's kind of

[628.079 - 632.0] interesting but unfortunately there's

[629.36 - 634.04] not a whole lot of news yet but what

[632.0 - 635.68] open AI is teasing is that at their

[634.04 - 637.0] upcoming developer conference they're

[635.68 - 640.04] going to introduce what they're calling

[637.0 - 643.36] a stateful API which could lower the

[640.04 - 646.279] cost of using the the the chat GPT API

[643.36 - 648.519] as much as 20 times like so 20-fold

[646.279 - 650.76] reduction in cost so they haven't

[648.519 - 652.68] released the details yet but um in

[650.76 - 655.24] reading about it and talking with with

[652.68 - 658.079] people it looks like it's some form of

[655.24 - 660.399] caching um so that that way like it it

[658.079 - 661.7199999999999] it maintains the conversation State now

[660.399 - 665.399] I don't know if that just means that it

[661.72 - 668.1600000000001] records the text of the conversation or

[665.399 - 670.2] if maybe they found a more efficient way

[668.16 - 673.399] of reducing cost which maybe it just

[670.2 - 675.0790000000001] records the embedding because uh for

[673.399 - 678.04] those that don't know the way that chat

[675.079 - 679.7199999999999] GPT Works internally is it the there's

[678.04 - 682.8] the there's the it's a Transformer

[679.72 - 684.76] architecture so on the input side it

[682.8 - 687.56] creates an embedding and that embedding

[684.76 - 689.72] is I think it's a 12,000 uh Dimension

[687.56 - 691.88] Vector that just it's a semantic

[689.72 - 693.76] representation that says hey here's

[691.88 - 695.72] here's where the conversation is at but

[693.76 - 698.0] you don't need you know walls and walls

[695.72 - 700.0400000000001] of text it's all recorded in the

[698.0 - 701.68] embedding and so if that's what they're

[700.04 - 703.88] doing which is what I suspect they're

[701.68 - 705.279] doing in that case all you have to do is

[703.88 - 707.399] record an embedding and say the

[705.279 - 708.76] conversation state was at this you don't

[707.399 - 711.04] need all the text you don't need to

[708.76 - 712.48] rebed that Vector every time instead

[711.04 - 714.7199999999999] what you do is you split the model in

[712.48 - 716.44] half so and who knows maybe it is split

[714.72 - 718.0400000000001] in half internally where they've got the

[716.44 - 720.9200000000001] embedding side and then the decoder side

[718.04 - 723.0] or the encoder and decoder side um and

[720.92 - 725.56] so then the stateful API might just say

[723.0 - 728.0] okay here's a uid connecting to this

[725.56 - 730.1199999999999] embedding so all you have to do is refer

[728.0 - 732.639] to this uuid and you can carry on the

[730.12 - 734.76] conversation from wherever you left off

[732.639 - 738.6] if I were them that's how I'd approach

[734.76 - 741.199] this but as a uh infrastructure engineer

[738.6 - 742.9200000000001] and Global Solutions architect um at

[741.199 - 745.4399999999999] other tech companies that's how i'

[742.92 - 747.079] approach it in terms of uh both

[745.44 - 749.399] increasing performance cuz if all you

[747.079 - 751.519] have to do is Sid load a vector

[749.399 - 753.279] rather than embed an entire thing

[751.519 - 755.9590000000001] that'll be faster but it'll also be much

[753.279 - 759.8] cheaper because you're it comes down to

[755.959 - 762.2399999999999] Watts every watt you have to spend um

[759.8 - 764.7199999999999] redoing and embedding is wasted energy

[762.24 - 767.519] so you know reduce reduce reduce just

[764.72 - 768.9590000000001] cut down on any excess like so one rule

[767.519 - 771.04] of thumb that I have whenever I'm doing

[768.959 - 773.6389999999999] automation work is process something

[771.04 - 776.279] once um if you can process something and

[773.639 - 779.279] then record it um if the act of

[776.279 - 781.519] recording is cheaper um to to

[779.279 - 783.279] energetically speaking and time speaking

[781.519 - 786.04] then that's going to be more efficient

[783.279 - 787.8389999999999] and so I've often talked about how you

[786.04 - 789.3199999999999] know whenever people ask me like Dave

[787.839 - 793.1990000000001] how do I get around this limitation or

[789.32 - 794.839] how do I reduce costs my my response to

[793.199 - 798.56] all of my clients and and everyone who

[794.839 - 801.399] asked me is just wait because chat GPT 4

[798.56 - 803.68] is like 10 times cheaper than gpt3 was a

[801.399 - 806.24] year or two ago and a year or two from

[803.68 - 808.4399999999999] now it'll be 10 times or in this case 20

[806.24 - 812.04] times cheaper uh and so you get these

[808.44 - 813.48] compound returns where you know like you

[812.04 - 815.88] instead of exponential growth it's

[813.48 - 817.839] exponential decay so you know the cost

[815.88 - 820.079] per token used to be 10 cents now it's 4

[817.839 - 822.2790000000001] cents soon it'll be 1 cent then it'll be

[820.079 - 825.76] you know basically trivial cost before

[822.279 - 827.4399999999999] too long uh especially as you know uh

[825.76 - 829.8] the chips get better the models get

[827.44 - 831.6] leaner and more efficient uh and other

[829.8 - 833.399] efficiencies are found not just

[831.6 - 835.1990000000001] necessarily in the model but in the rest

[833.399 - 837.92] of the software architecture and

[835.199 - 839.5999999999999] training and all that stuff so uh pay

[837.92 - 840.959] attention to the space I this is why I

[839.6 - 843.5600000000001] wanted to include this though is just

[840.959 - 846.8389999999999] like just wait you know you you'll see

[843.56 - 849.04] 10x drops in cost 20x drops in cost

[846.839 - 851.0400000000001] eventually you'll see 100,000x drops in

[849.04 - 853.48] cost and of course every time that these

[851.04 - 856.04] models get smarter cheaper faster better

[853.48 - 857.759] safer that also makes them a greater

[856.04 - 860.279] threat to jobs which we'll talk about in

[857.759 - 862.1990000000001] just a minute okay so this is super

[860.279 - 864.32] exciting I mentioned this on LinkedIn

[862.199 - 866.399] and I I made a previous video about it

[864.32 - 869.32] but the ace framework the autonomous

[866.399 - 872.199] cognitive Entity framework paper is live

[869.32 - 873.9590000000001] on archive it is officially published

[872.199 - 876.56] and released obviously archive is a

[873.959 - 878.6389999999999] pre-print server um this hasn't been to

[876.56 - 881.6389999999999] conference yet to you know to be peer

[878.639 - 885.279] reviewed or anything but my open source

[881.639 - 888.279] team um is we just finished the first

[885.279 - 891.6] Sprint on on building a proof of concept

[888.279 - 893.04] so actual code applied at this we had a

[891.6 - 895.399] we had a demo day yesterday was an

[893.04 - 897.639] internal demo day and we learned a lot

[895.399 - 898.92] we shared a lot of notes we recorded it

[897.639 - 902.36] um so we're working on a high highlight

[898.92 - 904.7199999999999] reel from that demo day but yeah so this

[902.36 - 906.759] is really exciting the code is happening

[904.72 - 908.6800000000001] one of the most important things and I'm

[906.759 - 911.36] not going to like rehash everything but

[908.68 - 913.0] the most important takeaway from the

[911.36 - 915.519] team conversation yesterday which was a

[913.0 - 918.36] two-hour conversation um was that there

[915.519 - 920.079] are no technical barriers to progress

[918.36 - 921.6800000000001] everything that we're trying to do and

[920.079 - 924.4799999999999] everything that we need the models to do

[921.68 - 926.079] they are capable of doing all of the all

[924.48 - 928.12] of the infrastructure that's

[926.079 - 930.3599999999999] underpinning the architecture all of the

[928.12 - 933.12] vector search databases all of the

[930.36 - 935.0] message cues like literally all the

[933.12 - 937.079] pieces are there we just have to

[935.0 - 938.839] assemble it and we have to do some of

[937.079 - 940.7199999999999] the prompt engineering figure out the

[938.839 - 943.9590000000001] meta prompting strategies figure out the

[940.72 - 946.399] communication between the layers um but

[943.959 - 948.68] this stands in St contrast to my earlier

[946.399 - 951.759] work on cognitive architectures where

[948.68 - 953.4799999999999] gpt3 was good it just wasn't good enough

[951.759 - 955.6800000000001] even with fine-tuning it just wasn't

[953.48 - 958.839] smart enough the context window wasn't

[955.68 - 962.319] big enough but but particularly GP PT

[958.839 - 964.2790000000001] 3.5 turbo and GPT 4 these models are

[962.319 - 966.12] smart enough and they're good enough and

[964.279 - 968.72] also I had a few friends uh join the

[966.12 - 970.079] team who are uh experts in open source

[968.72 - 972.24] models so that was actually one of the

[970.079 - 974.079] biggest most consistent comments and

[972.24 - 976.519] requests both in the comments in the

[974.079 - 978.88] previous video and discussions on the uh

[976.519 - 980.72] GitHub which is now that people are

[978.88 - 983.279] seeing that cognitive architecture and

[980.72 - 985.0790000000001] autonomous agents are eminently possible

[983.279 - 987.759] there's a tremendous amount of interest

[985.079 - 989.7199999999999] in getting this over to open source uh

[987.759 - 991.279] for numerous reasons not the least of

[989.72 - 993.72] which is just more control over the

[991.279 - 996.199] models but we've also seen some recent

[993.72 - 998.24] um studies and demonstrations that you

[996.199 - 1000.0] can get really good performance out of

[998.24 - 1001.519] very small models I think the most

[1000.0 - 1003.399] recent one was that a 7 billion

[1001.519 - 1005.839] parameter model outperformed a 70

[1003.399 - 1007.48] billion parameter model and so when you

[1005.839 - 1009.9590000000001] have models that are that small you can

[1007.48 - 1011.88] run them locally and that is better for

[1009.959 - 1013.92] privacy it's better for Safety and

[1011.88 - 1015.8389999999999] Security and there's all sorts of

[1013.92 - 1017.8389999999999] reasons that this is better now

[1015.839 - 1020.2790000000001] obviously these Frontier these Flagship

[1017.839 - 1022.72] models like G G pt4 they're the smartest

[1020.279 - 1025.4] and most powerful but the open source

[1022.72 - 1026.959] space is actually accelerating so you

[1025.4 - 1029.919] might remember at the beginning of this

[1026.959 - 1031.76] year 6 to 12 months ago uh where people

[1029.919 - 1034.1200000000001] were like oh yeah open source is good

[1031.76 - 1035.919] but it's a year or two behind now open

[1034.12 - 1037.6789999999999] source is only a couple of weeks to a

[1035.919 - 1039.7990000000002] couple of months behind these Frontier

[1037.679 - 1041.3190000000002] models uh which is really exciting and

[1039.799 - 1042.8799999999999] it's good news for us but it also goes

[1041.319 - 1044.839] back to what I was talking about where

[1042.88 - 1047.959] the genie is out of the bottle like we

[1044.839 - 1050.36] cannot contain AI it is impossible to to

[1047.959 - 1052.0] even try and contain it so don't bother

[1050.36 - 1054.039] instead what we need to do is align it

[1052.0 - 1056.919] and make it autonomous and and safe and

[1054.039 - 1059.2] trustworthy so that uh it aligns with us

[1056.919 - 1061.64] and we align with it and um that's my

[1059.2 - 1063.039] opinion obviously so that's uh that's it

[1061.64 - 1064.4] for the ace framework I do have a couple

[1063.039 - 1066.08] really small announcements before we get

[1064.4 - 1067.88] to the rest of the video first I've got

[1066.08 - 1069.799] a new substack I'm moving away from

[1067.88 - 1071.4] medium because a lot of people

[1069.799 - 1073.6] complained that Medium was paywalled and

[1071.4 - 1075.6000000000001] I was like no it's not um but I realized

[1073.6 - 1077.08] that um I actually don't know how medium

[1075.6 - 1079.3999999999999] Works cuz some things are pay waled and

[1077.08 - 1080.9189999999999] some things aren't and it doesn't ask me

[1079.4 - 1083.72] um so anyways I'm moving away from

[1080.919 - 1085.7990000000002] medium to substack um Link in the

[1083.72 - 1087.4] description I also just activated

[1085.799 - 1089.84] Channel membership so I'm still working

[1087.4 - 1091.88] that out but uh at the at the very

[1089.84 - 1093.799] Baseline level uh if you become a

[1091.88 - 1096.3200000000002] YouTube channel member your comments get

[1093.799 - 1098.96] top priority you get a set of unique uh

[1096.32 - 1101.48] cool emojis I I made those by hand uh

[1098.96 - 1104.8400000000001] well by hand with Dolly uh and you also

[1101.48 - 1106.679] get some some uh unique Raven badges

[1104.84 - 1109.48] also I've got books merch and a little

[1106.679 - 1111.159] bit more coming soon so I'm working on a

[1109.48 - 1112.679] systems thinking book on my other

[1111.159 - 1115.159] channel my neuros spicy Channel my

[1112.679 - 1117.1200000000001] systems thinking series is by far the

[1115.159 - 1119.2800000000002] most popular series of videos so I'm

[1117.12 - 1122.1589999999999] going to make a whole book uh teaching

[1119.28 - 1124.559] you how to think like I do um and then

[1122.159 - 1126.5200000000002] I've also got a Sci-Fi uh right now it's

[1124.559 - 1128.2] a duy but it might be a Trilogy that I'm

[1126.52 - 1130.2] working on I've I've been referring to

[1128.2 - 1133.44] this for a while um there's also going

[1130.2 - 1134.919] to be some 4ir swag we've got uh like

[1133.44 - 1137.44] some some mugs and stuff that we're

[1134.919 - 1138.96] working on um probably some T-shirts and

[1137.44 - 1140.4] other stuff there's going to be

[1138.96 - 1142.039] exclusive offers to my patreon

[1140.4 - 1143.88] supporters substack subscribers and

[1142.039 - 1146.2] channel members as well as some Early

[1143.88 - 1148.3200000000002] Access to this stuff and of course I've

[1146.2 - 1150.2] also got the uh exclusive Discord where

[1148.32 - 1152.84] we talk about neuros spicy stuff and Ai

[1150.2 - 1154.52] and uh existential coping the uh the

[1152.84 - 1157.1999999999998] existential coping thread is is one of

[1154.52 - 1158.799] the most popular threads anyways my goal

[1157.2 - 1161.1200000000001] Remains the Same is I want to maximize

[1158.799 - 1162.8799999999999] the chance of success of humanity not

[1161.12 - 1165.9599999999998] just surviving but thriving in the

[1162.88 - 1168.5200000000002] future so literally everything that I do

[1165.96 - 1171.0] is based on Grassroots support so really

[1168.52 - 1173.24] appreciate everyone who uh chimes in

[1171.0 - 1175.559] chips in whatever way that you can like

[1173.24 - 1177.2] subscribe comment or support me on any

[1175.559 - 1180.0] of these other platforms all right back

[1177.2 - 1181.88] to the show so job destruction is

[1180.0 - 1183.96] something that I talk about a lot I talk

[1181.88 - 1186.0] about post- labor economics where

[1183.96 - 1188.32] basically the the central idea of post

[1186.0 - 1190.32] labor economics is that uh getting rid

[1188.32 - 1192.12] of humans from the work force is a good

[1190.32 - 1194.24] thing um and that we should actively

[1192.12 - 1195.6789999999999] work to automate away the need for human

[1194.24 - 1198.6] labor because it is the greatest

[1195.679 - 1201.0] constraint on uh progress and

[1198.6 - 1203.8799999999999] productivity now that being said that

[1201.0 - 1205.679] represents a very fundamental uh

[1203.88 - 1208.4] paradigm shift in terms of how we even

[1205.679 - 1211.919] think about economics so I'm always Keen

[1208.4 - 1214.96] to pay attention to um news and evidence

[1211.919 - 1218.0] of uh AI destroying jobs because the

[1214.96 - 1220.48] thing is is right now there's no

[1218.0 - 1223.52] evidence that AI is creating new jobs

[1220.48 - 1225.1200000000001] sure we've had uh comments from from

[1223.52 - 1228.28] various CEOs saying oh we're not going

[1225.12 - 1230.1999999999998] to fire anybody but then it's like yeah

[1228.28 - 1232.32] like but you have a hiring freeze and

[1230.2 - 1235.559] you just laid off 7,000 people and you

[1232.32 - 1237.48] created only a th000 new job openings so

[1235.559 - 1239.3999999999999] even if you're you're saying that AI is

[1237.48 - 1241.48] quote creating new jobs it's creating

[1239.4 - 1242.72] far fewer than it's destroying that is

[1241.48 - 1245.559] of course what it seems like is

[1242.72 - 1248.0] happening now so in this case this was

[1245.559 - 1250.0] another example where it seems like the

[1248.0 - 1252.72] the the lowest hanging fruit for AI to

[1250.0 - 1255.36] replace is obviously uh graphic artists

[1252.72 - 1257.4] have been greatly harmed by uh image

[1255.36 - 1259.84] generators the Hollywood riter strike

[1257.4 - 1262.3600000000001] just ended Rec recently so AI you know

[1259.84 - 1264.1589999999999] for writing so basically creativity was

[1262.36 - 1265.6399999999999] the first thing the second thing seems

[1264.159 - 1267.679] to be CSR customer service

[1265.64 - 1270.2] representative jobs are the next on The

[1267.679 - 1273.44] Chopping Block in terms of uh victims of

[1270.2 - 1276.159] the AI thing now honestly like when you

[1273.44 - 1277.4] think about it a CSR is kind of like a

[1276.159 - 1280.44] telephone operator and of course

[1277.4 - 1282.799] telephone operators went out of work

[1280.44 - 1284.72] decades ago so and I'm not obviously

[1282.799 - 1286.279] like what a CSR does is much more

[1284.72 - 1288.72] sophisticated than what a telephone

[1286.279 - 1291.76] operator does but because it is such a

[1288.72 - 1292.919] narrowly constrained and defined job um

[1291.76 - 1295.36] I think that's what makes it very

[1292.919 - 1297.3200000000002] vulnerable to Total automation because

[1295.36 - 1299.279] once you have voice and once you have

[1297.32 - 1301.48] conversational ability there's a whole

[1299.279 - 1303.36] bunch of jobs that are just imminently

[1301.48 - 1306.279] going to go away and you look at the

[1303.36 - 1309.279] progress of like open AI whisper and 11

[1306.279 - 1311.44] Labs with voice synthesis you can even

[1309.279 - 1313.24] have face-to-face conversations with

[1311.44 - 1316.0] fully digital avatars or what I call

[1313.24 - 1318.88] metahumans the a metahuman is a fa

[1316.0 - 1321.2] simile it is a copy without an original

[1318.88 - 1323.6000000000001] so uh metahumans are probably the

[1321.2 - 1325.0800000000002] creepiest thing so what I and we've

[1323.6 - 1327.1999999999998] already seen this actually with um

[1325.08 - 1329.48] influencers and creators and YouTube

[1327.2 - 1330.96] personalities that like they look like

[1329.48 - 1332.4] real people but they were never real

[1330.96 - 1334.279] people and you've probably seen it

[1332.4 - 1336.919] referred to as like fake humans I call

[1334.279 - 1339.32] it metahumans um to be a little bit more

[1336.919 - 1342.0800000000002] specific but the idea is that we are

[1339.32 - 1343.6399999999999] creating AI in our own image which says

[1342.08 - 1345.4399999999998] a whole bunch of stuff about our deep

[1343.64 - 1348.039] unconscious psychology and Freudian

[1345.44 - 1350.24] stuff which I'm not going to get lost on

[1348.039 - 1353.24] that rabbit hole anyways long story

[1350.24 - 1356.039] short uh kind of got carried away there

[1353.24 - 1358.0] uh is that uh job destruction is coming

[1356.039 - 1360.279] and I still haven't seen any evidence of

[1358.0 - 1362.76] job creation from AI at least not any

[1360.279 - 1364.08] substantive uh job creation if you have

[1362.76 - 1366.64] please let me know in the comments cuz

[1364.08 - 1368.48] I'm happy to follow up um on on that

[1366.64 - 1371.5200000000002] kind of stuff so but

[1368.48 - 1373.799] yeah uh last or second to last is animal

[1371.52 - 1377.32] communication so this has been kind of a

[1373.799 - 1378.72] a recurring uh theme this year where AI

[1377.32 - 1380.24] is more and more being used to

[1378.72 - 1382.24] communicate with dolphins or at least

[1380.24 - 1384.48] decipher what things like dolphins and

[1382.24 - 1386.72] whales are saying as well as the chirps

[1384.48 - 1388.72] of like um what was it not was it field

[1386.72 - 1391.76] rodents or field mice or something like

[1388.72 - 1394.08] that anyways we are getting better and

[1391.76 - 1395.8799999999999] better at using artificial intelligence

[1394.08 - 1399.32] in order to understand the communication

[1395.88 - 1401.919] of animals and the thing is the most

[1399.32 - 1403.76] important thing here is what the ability

[1401.919 - 1406.24] to communicate implies about

[1403.76 - 1409.4] Consciousness and sentience I remember

[1406.24 - 1412.24] watching uh a documentary about Coco the

[1409.4 - 1413.919] gorilla who was able she was able to use

[1412.24 - 1416.4] sign language in order to express

[1413.919 - 1418.76] desires and emotions and wants and there

[1416.4 - 1420.52] was maybe there is still controversy but

[1418.76 - 1422.76] I remember at the time there was a lot

[1420.52 - 1424.24] of controversy saying oh well this isn't

[1422.76 - 1426.84] communication she's not actually

[1424.24 - 1430.84] expressing unique thoughts she's just

[1426.84 - 1432.4399999999998] matching some Behavior to uh getting

[1430.84 - 1434.6] something that she wants instrumentally

[1432.44 - 1438.3200000000002] she knew how to ask for berries she knew

[1434.6 - 1440.36] how to say like you know want water but

[1438.32 - 1442.2] uh I read the book um language Instinct

[1440.36 - 1445.3999999999999] by Steven Pinker and as a language

[1442.2 - 1447.159] expert he un he debunked like that push

[1445.4 - 1449.24] back against coko like wasn't actually

[1447.159 - 1451.5590000000002] sentient or whatever because she was

[1449.24 - 1453.4] able to express emotions when she heard

[1451.559 - 1456.24] that Robin Williams had died and she had

[1453.4 - 1459.6000000000001] met Robin Williams she said that she she

[1456.24 - 1461.799] signed cry and something else I don't

[1459.6 - 1464.4399999999998] remember but like she had an emotive

[1461.799 - 1467.2] expression um and then there was another

[1464.44 - 1469.0] there the funniest instance was um she

[1467.2 - 1471.52] got upset and ripped her sink off the

[1469.0 - 1475.2] wall and then blamed her kitten so the

[1471.52 - 1477.399] ability of a of a of a of a gorilla to

[1475.2 - 1479.3990000000001] do something to understand that there

[1477.399 - 1481.9599999999998] would be consequences and then to lie

[1479.399 - 1484.7199999999998] about it so this is this is an animal

[1481.96 - 1487.3600000000001] that is not human but has the ability to

[1484.72 - 1490.279] deceive so that implies a lot about

[1487.36 - 1492.1589999999999] cognition um which you know i' I've

[1490.279 - 1493.72] recently done videos about AI being able

[1492.159 - 1495.3600000000001] to deceive us whether or not it's

[1493.72 - 1498.3990000000001] deliberate and intentional is another

[1495.36 - 1499.8799999999999] question uh but anyways I I think that

[1498.399 - 1501.9599999999998] what we will come to find as we

[1499.88 - 1504.0800000000002] communicate with animals more and more

[1501.96 - 1505.159] is that our definition and our

[1504.08 - 1507.52] understanding of Consciousness and

[1505.159 - 1509.7600000000002] sentience is going to expand a lot

[1507.52 - 1511.559] obviously there's many many of you uh in

[1509.76 - 1513.96] my audience that already understand this

[1511.559 - 1516.36] and believe that uh Consciousness and

[1513.96 - 1517.8400000000001] sentience is far more broad spectrum

[1516.36 - 1519.8799999999999] than just humans but there are also

[1517.84 - 1521.48] plenty of people who make an argument

[1519.88 - 1524.1200000000001] that Consciousness and sentient

[1521.48 - 1525.3600000000001] sentience is exclusively a human thing

[1524.12 - 1526.9599999999998] um let me know in the comments where you

[1525.36 - 1528.1999999999998] where you fall on that Spectrum maybe

[1526.96 - 1529.2] I'll run a poll later

[1528.2 - 1532.799] I'm not really

[1529.2 - 1536.52] sure and finally last but not least is

[1532.799 - 1537.52] research on CTIC cells so uh obviously

[1536.52 - 1539.72] this is a little bit different from

[1537.52 - 1542.08] artificial intelligence but longevity is

[1539.72 - 1544.3600000000001] a huge topic here uh in the fourth

[1542.08 - 1546.72] Industrial Revolution and so if you're

[1544.36 - 1548.9599999999998] not aware what a cytic cell is it's

[1546.72 - 1550.76] basically just an old cell but what

[1548.96 - 1552.3990000000001] happens is I watched a full documentary

[1550.76 - 1554.8799999999999] on this so I can tell you a little bit

[1552.399 - 1557.9189999999999] more about the key thing that's going on

[1554.88 - 1559.48] here cytic cells are old and what they

[1557.919 - 1561.679] do is they start broadcasting

[1559.48 - 1563.3600000000001] inflammation signals and so these

[1561.679 - 1566.76] inflammation signals basically say I'm

[1563.36 - 1568.52] old and crotchy like we're slowly dying

[1566.76 - 1570.24] and what we have found is that if you

[1568.52 - 1572.8799999999999] just get rid of senolytic cells the

[1570.24 - 1574.0] organism as a whole um is I don't know

[1572.88 - 1576.48] if they live longer but they're

[1574.0 - 1578.64] certainly healthier and so just by

[1576.48 - 1581.24] getting rid of these little like old

[1578.64 - 1583.0] geriatric cells that are broadcasting uh

[1581.24 - 1586.2] inflammation signals these reactive

[1583.0 - 1589.0] oxygen species uh then the overall

[1586.2 - 1592.32] organism becomes healthy and more uh

[1589.0 - 1594.88] rejuvenated so this is one component of

[1592.32 - 1596.96] Aging it is not it's not a complete

[1594.88 - 1599.5590000000002] solution to aging but it's like okay

[1596.96 - 1601.76] well you add cytic break uh you know

[1599.559 - 1603.84] treatments with you know a few other

[1601.76 - 1606.799] like maybe telr regeneration and a few

[1603.84 - 1608.6789999999999] other you know uh aspects it's entirely

[1606.799 - 1610.8799999999999] possible that this will become one

[1608.679 - 1613.159] component of a full package of

[1610.88 - 1614.6000000000001] Rejuvenation Therapies in the long run

[1613.159 - 1616.7600000000002] and the reason that I included this is

[1614.6 - 1619.6] because I have seen so many articles

[1616.76 - 1621.2] about senolytics cell uh targeting this

[1619.6 - 1623.6] year so this seems like it's kind of the

[1621.2 - 1626.0] next uh most eminent Frontier so I

[1623.6 - 1628.279] wouldn't be surprised if within the next

[1626.0 - 1631.279] year or two and maybe it's already here

[1628.279 - 1634.2] um but people working on uh getting FDA

[1631.279 - 1636.24] approval for cellytic drugs that will

[1634.2 - 1638.8400000000001] basically you take a drug and your

[1636.24 - 1641.799] body's inflammation uh score goes down

[1638.84 - 1644.52] and you age much much slower we'll see

[1641.799 - 1645.8799999999999] if that's uh how it plays out so anyways

[1644.52 - 1648.2] thanks for watching let me know how you

[1645.88 - 1650.24] like this format uh people tend to like

[1648.2 - 1652.559] how I do deep Dives on things and unpack

[1650.24 - 1653.96] stuff and kind of tell you what it means

[1652.559 - 1656.72] um obviously there's plenty of other

[1653.96 - 1658.32] channels that do news um but I think let

[1656.72 - 1659.919] me know if you like my particular take

[1658.32 - 1661.72] on it and um yeah I'll adjust

[1659.919 - 1664.159] accordingly thanks for watching have a

[1661.72 - 1664.159] good one
