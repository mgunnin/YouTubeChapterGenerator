[0.599 - 5.819] all right gang David Shapiro here uh we

[3.48 - 10.08] are going to wrap up this uh tutorial

[5.819 - 11.099] series on uh using chat GPT to code

[10.08 - 14.4] um

[11.099 - 16.02] so first though I need to do a couple of

[14.4 - 18.060000000000002] plugs so one

[16.02 - 20.939] um I just recorded a really great

[18.06 - 22.32] podcast episode with Bax tea future

[20.939 - 25.560000000000002] um that'll be coming out on his channel

[22.32 - 28.439] uh probably later this week it was a

[25.56 - 30.84] three and a half hour long conversation

[28.439 - 34.38] um and uh we talked about the uh it was

[30.84 - 37.44] it was in one one part was a recap of uh

[34.38 - 39.78] 2022 in terms of AI and technology and

[37.44 - 41.218999999999994] then we pivoted to talk about AI

[39.78 - 43.079] startups because that's all the rage

[41.219 - 44.76] right now

[43.079 - 46.559] um yeah so look for we'll look for that

[44.76 - 49.559] over on his channel

[46.559 - 51.059] uh number two is I need to do a plug for

[49.559 - 53.82] myself

[51.059 - 55.919999999999995] um so one of my goals is to be able to

[53.82 - 58.44] do this full time and I'm not going to

[55.92 - 60.300000000000004] do it with ad Revenue so

[58.44 - 61.98] um please consider jumping over to my

[60.3 - 64.01899999999999] patreon page and supporting me on

[61.98 - 66.0] patreon one person said that they were

[64.019 - 67.38000000000001] confused by the levels they're they're

[66.0 - 69.96] no different I just gave you different

[67.38 - 72.36] options for level of support

[69.96 - 74.58] um what I what I used to do was I used

[72.36 - 77.28] to have where if you paid enough I would

[74.58 - 78.9] like give you like one-on-one time but I

[77.28 - 81.78] don't have enough time to do that so

[78.9 - 83.58000000000001] instead I just added levels and and what

[81.78 - 86.93900000000001] you do get if you support me on patreon

[83.58 - 88.79899999999999] is access to my exclusive blog where

[86.939 - 91.439] I'll give you Insider updates as to what

[88.799 - 93.60000000000001] I'm up to some of my thoughts

[91.439 - 95.939] um and also you get like Priority Access

[93.6 - 97.74] because sometimes I'll ask my patreons

[95.939 - 99.83999999999999] like hey can you connect me to something

[97.74 - 101.78] or I want to talk to you guys

[99.84 - 105.479] um so if you want to get on the inside

[101.78 - 108.72] uh definitely hop over to patreon and

[105.479 - 111.42] then lastly if you want to sync up

[108.72 - 112.92] um and collaborate with me or my team

[111.42 - 115.259] um please feel free to come and connect

[112.92 - 117.42] with me on LinkedIn I checked LinkedIn

[115.259 - 119.759] far more than Twitter or Discord

[117.42 - 122.399] nowadays so with that out of the way

[119.759 - 124.799] let's get back to what we were working

[122.399 - 127.979] on so here's where we left off

[124.799 - 131.34] uh nope you don't need to see my Spotify

[127.979 - 134.459] um so we got to the point where we have

[131.34 - 137.34] all of our all of our uh opinions broken

[134.459 - 138.0] down into Json files

[137.34 - 140.099] um

[138.0 - 142.98] so let's see the biggest one is six

[140.099 - 144.11999999999998] kilobytes that's not too big

[142.98 - 145.98] um

[144.12 - 148.37900000000002] and I got this one got cut off so it's

[145.98 - 149.51999999999998] not this one's not even not even not

[148.379 - 152.28] even good

[149.52 - 152.94] um not even usable that's fine

[152.28 - 155.94] um

[152.94 - 158.57999999999998] this one got cut off as well part of

[155.94 - 159.239] that was probably uh token limits

[158.58 - 162.48000000000002] um

[159.239 - 166.20000000000002] this one this one was finished so

[162.48 - 167.819] uh yeah so a lot of this is not going to

[166.2 - 170.099] be usable and remember this is like

[167.819 - 171.78] rapid prototyping so

[170.099 - 173.099] um I that's why I'm not that's why I'm

[171.78 - 175.98] just kind of like going as fast as I can

[173.099 - 177.78] and I'm not really like trying to make a

[175.98 - 179.76] finished product

[177.78 - 183.42] um but this is like proof of concept but

[179.76 - 186.29999999999998] we do have some that are good or almost

[183.42 - 190.5] really good at least so let's see what

[186.3 - 193.14000000000001] we can do now I went to ask GPT chat GPT

[190.5 - 195.9] uh how do we visualize it in a geffy so

[193.14 - 198.659] I've seen people talk about geffy so I

[195.9 - 200.4] went and downloaded it got it installed

[198.659 - 203.04] um it's definitely like a free open

[200.4 - 209.64000000000001] source one but unfortunately it only

[203.04 - 213.72] uses gxf gex F or graphml or CSV but

[209.64 - 215.94] we've got everything in in Json so if we

[213.72 - 220.379] want to visualize any of these we've got

[215.94 - 223.2] to do it in gex F I'm not sure what the

[220.379 - 226.92] correct pronunciation is

[223.2 - 228.56] um but graphic exchange or graph

[226.92 - 232.26] Exchange

[228.56 - 233.7] file so it's basically a type of XML so

[232.26 - 237.12] let's see

[233.7 - 237.83999999999997] let's talk to this guy and say Okay

[237.12 - 241.08] um

[237.84 - 243.36] I've got a folder called let's see what

[241.08 - 245.84] did I call this folder kg underscore

[243.36 - 245.84] Json

[246.0 - 254.28] that is full of dot Json uh LD formatted

[252.959 - 256.4] um

[254.28 - 261.419] kg files

[256.4 - 263.21999999999997] I need to convert them to gex F for

[261.419 - 265.28] gephy

[263.22 - 265.28000000000003] um

[265.38 - 275.28] but here's the problem some of

[270.3 - 277.199] the Json files are malformed

[275.28 - 279.78] not completed

[277.199 - 283.5] so we need to First

[279.78 - 289.85999999999996] check if they render properly

[283.5 - 294.0] if not we can ignore them and Skip them

[289.86 - 297.18] but the second problem is they don't

[294.0 - 297.78] all follow the same

[297.18 - 301.86] um

[297.78 - 305.419] the same uh let's see format

[301.86 - 305.41900000000004] so let me show you what I mean

[305.94 - 309.02] so for instance

[310.1 - 318.86] in this one there's no graph element

[314.52 - 318.85999999999996] but in others there are right

[320.16 - 325.02000000000004] so there's there's no graph element in

[322.139 - 327.90000000000003] this one but then we grab another one

[325.02 - 330.35999999999996] um this one has similar oh and so by the

[327.9 - 333.17999999999995] way this is why I say we need to keep

[330.36 - 336.18] fine tuning is because when you get to

[333.18 - 340.259] really specific cases like this

[336.18 - 342.419] um you want a very consistent format

[340.259 - 344.16] um and but just telling just telling it

[342.419 - 346.62] instruct so here's here's an example

[344.16 - 348.96000000000004] where there's context and like yeah they

[346.62 - 350.699] there's different like methods anyways

[348.96 - 352.02] so

[350.699 - 353.759] um

[352.02 - 357.59999999999997] foreign

[353.759 - 359.96000000000004] some have let's see for instance some

[357.6 - 359.96000000000004] have

[361.02 - 367.919] uh graph properties and others don't

[365.58 - 372.419] um we need to

[367.919 - 374.82] write a python script that will

[372.419 - 377.18] open them

[374.82 - 381.12] validate um

[377.18 - 381.78000000000003] and homogenize

[381.12 - 385.759] um

[381.78 - 385.75899999999996] we need the

[385.86 - 390.12] the ultimate goal is to

[389.4 - 394.79999999999995] um

[390.12 - 398.28000000000003] output a single gex file

[394.8 - 401.88] is this even possible

[398.28 - 404.58] do we need to break this down into

[401.88 - 407.78] multiple steps

[404.58 - 407.78] all right let's see what it says

[416.34 - 421.039] okay so it's going to walk through the

[418.02 - 421.039] reasoning that it uses

[423.06 - 430.759] okay there's a valid Pi LD uh python is

[427.62 - 430.759] valid Json LD

[435.96 - 441.85999999999996] Network X Library to create graph object

[438.419 - 441.85999999999996] from the Json L data

[450.3 - 456.24] cool okay so this just walked through

[453.12 - 459.24] the entire process

[456.24 - 461.34000000000003] um someone someone on the internet uh I

[459.24 - 463.02] think it was on LinkedIn said uh

[461.34 - 465.06] chat GPT is going to make everyone

[463.02 - 467.039] dumber and lazier you should learn to do

[465.06 - 469.259] it yourself and I definitely agree so

[467.039 - 471.539] let's talk about this because this this

[469.259 - 473.16] video is not going to take too long

[471.539 - 475.199] um but let's talk about the implications

[473.16 - 476.52000000000004] of this for a second I'm in this

[475.199 - 479.34000000000003] headspace because I just had that

[476.52 - 481.31899999999996] interview with Bax so

[479.34 - 484.31899999999996] this just taught me a whole bunch of

[481.319 - 487.259] stuff that I didn't know right

[484.319 - 489.599] um I didn't know about the pi LD thing I

[487.259 - 491.34000000000003] didn't know about Network X so I just

[489.599 - 493.5] had a problem and I said help me solve

[491.34 - 495.96] this problem now does that make me

[493.5 - 498.479] Dumber right because I didn't go read

[495.96 - 501.25899999999996] the hard way you know like I got you

[498.479 - 505.02] know I downloaded uh the geffy you know

[501.259 - 507.18] documentation but this is still like I

[505.02 - 509.75899999999996] have to skim and and and you know it's

[507.18 - 512.4590000000001] 32 Pages that's a lot of reading

[509.759 - 513.659] what is ultimately valuable

[512.459 - 518.159] time

[513.659 - 519.539] is the most valuable uh commodity in all

[518.159 - 520.8] of existence it's more precious than

[519.539 - 523.26] gold

[520.8 - 526.1999999999999] so the fact that this is able to help me

[523.26 - 529.38] do more in less time

[526.2 - 531.6600000000001] and I will learn some of the underlying

[529.38 - 533.76] stuff in the wash right so here's the

[531.66 - 537.6] thing is like we build machines to

[533.76 - 539.279] abstract away uh uh some of our labor

[537.6 - 540.72] right that's what computers do that's

[539.279 - 542.9399999999999] why they have the name computer they

[540.72 - 545.279] compute math that was how they started

[542.94 - 547.98] was um what some of the first use cases

[545.279 - 550.8] of mechanical computers was to calculate

[547.98 - 553.08] firing solutions for for big navy guns

[550.8 - 555.959] during World War II

[553.08 - 557.58] and the women who did that who did all

[555.959 - 559.26] the math they were called computers it

[557.58 - 562.74] was the computer pool but it was human

[559.26 - 565.98] computers anyways so we always build

[562.74 - 568.44] machines to offload our mental labor so

[565.98 - 570.24] this is just the next the next uh

[568.44 - 572.339] iteration of that

[570.24 - 575.88] um I'm now I'm not saying like this is

[572.339 - 578.519] not the same as a TI-83 calculator this

[575.88 - 581.3389999999999] is Miles beyond that but at the same

[578.519 - 583.98] time this will ultimately allow me to do

[581.339 - 586.399] more experiment faster and and generally

[583.98 - 589.62] accelerate things and nobody bemoans

[586.399 - 591.18] databases right like to me if someone's

[589.62 - 593.22] complaining like oh this just makes you

[591.18 - 594.54] lazy like that's about the same as

[593.22 - 595.9200000000001] saying like oh well you should just

[594.54 - 598.56] print everything out and manually

[595.92 - 600.66] collate your database like no we're not

[598.56 - 603.3599999999999] going to do that use SQL

[600.66 - 604.92] um and so to me it's like and and I'm

[603.36 - 607.2] saying this as someone who is typically

[604.92 - 609.0] like a Luddite like I am the last person

[607.2 - 610.6800000000001] to adopt new technologies usually

[609.0 - 612.36] especially in my day job in my

[610.68 - 615.779] professional life because you know what

[612.36 - 618.24] new stuff fragile and it breaks and it's

[615.779 - 620.88] expensive and it's difficult to

[618.24 - 622.5600000000001] integrate whatever etc etc but this is

[620.88 - 625.32] different Chad GPT is different because

[622.56 - 627.1199999999999] this is helping me do better here I'm

[625.32 - 631.019] going to give you a nice little Kudos

[627.12 - 632.4590000000001] feedback this is great

[631.019 - 635.1] I don't know why they have why you have

[632.459 - 637.68] to like all you need is a true false all

[635.1 - 641.339] right actually no I bet they're they're

[637.68 - 643.3199999999999] asking you why because that is a Even

[641.339 - 645.5400000000001] Better Label and they can improve it

[643.32 - 647.4590000000001] further anyways

[645.54 - 650.0999999999999] so

[647.459 - 652.1999999999999] all right get off my soapbox that's not

[650.1 - 654.5400000000001] why y'all are here let's move on excuse

[652.2 - 657.9590000000001] me okay so

[654.54 - 660.899] this is fine use it to to parse and load

[657.959 - 662.579] it into python dictionary that's fine

[660.899 - 666.899] um all right so

[662.579 - 669.12] uh let's see great idea let's start with

[666.899 - 673.74] the first script

[669.12 - 675.12] um this first one we'll use Json module

[673.74 - 678.36] to

[675.12 - 683.399] try to load the Json

[678.36 - 684.24] um we should use a try accept Clause

[683.399 - 686.459] um

[684.24 - 688.92] in case it

[686.459 - 690.2399999999999] blows up

[688.92 - 694.26] um

[690.24 - 696.36] if the Json doesn't even load we can

[694.26 - 698.76] move on

[696.36 - 701.1] um okay cool

[698.76 - 703.16] next

[701.1 - 703.16] um

[703.32 - 708.779] let's see

[704.76 - 713.36] once the Json object is loaded into

[708.779 - 713.36] memory then please

[713.399 - 722.82] please use the pi LD

[717.079 - 725.399] Library function is valid Json

[722.82 - 729.8000000000001] uh LD

[725.399 - 734.82] um to check if it is legit

[729.8 - 736.16] assuming it passes that

[734.82 - 739.399] um

[736.16 - 739.399] let's see

[739.86 - 742.4590000000001] yep

[742.98 - 747.779] uh assuming it passes that uh well

[746.16 - 749.459] actually here

[747.779 - 751.56] um

[749.459 - 754.26] please write

[751.56 - 756.0] this script

[754.26 - 758.399] um

[756.0 - 760.019] yeah

[758.399 - 761.339] and then while it's doing that I'm going

[760.019 - 767.0600000000001] to go ahead and see if I need to install

[761.339 - 767.0600000000001] anything so pip install Pi LD

[776.76 - 781.62] and then let's see what else did I need

[779.1 - 783.6] we need

[781.62 - 786.42] um I think that's as far as we need

[783.6 - 789.6800000000001] right now so let's do uh pip install

[786.42 - 789.68] Network X

[792.5 - 795.68] all right

[798.54 - 802.74] this looks good

[800.7 - 806.12] we're going to need to add the uh

[802.74 - 806.12] encoding utf-8

[816.56 - 821.2199999999999] okay so it'll tell us if it is valid and

[820.079 - 822.899] if not

[821.22 - 825.5] excellent so let's go ahead and give

[822.899 - 825.5] this a try

[827.519 - 833.0600000000001] um

[828.72 - 833.0600000000001] so then we'll save this here as

[834.0 - 839.76] step O3

[835.82 - 841.62] validate Json dot pi

[839.76 - 844.22] excuse me all right and then let's come

[841.62 - 849.0600000000001] over here and zoom in a little bit

[844.22 - 852.1800000000001] and we'll do uh CD to scotus

[849.06 - 854.88] and then we'll do python

[852.18 - 857.76] wow sorry my typing is horrible

[854.88 - 859.5] I think I moved my keyboard around and

[857.76 - 861.48] it's like just slightly to the left and

[859.5 - 863.339] so like my fingers are wrong muscle

[861.48 - 867.24] memory is everything man all right

[863.339 - 868.98] python uh what was that step

[867.24 - 871.5] I have two step threes that's that's

[868.98 - 873.24] incorrect that's gonna mess with my my

[871.5 - 874.56] OCD

[873.24 - 876.54] sorry buddy

[874.56 - 877.9799999999999] step o4

[876.54 - 881.519] no don't keep it in that's the wrong

[877.98 - 883.86] pile all right come back here step 04

[881.519 - 887.579] my counting is off my typing is off it's

[883.86 - 888.779] fine I'm doing great doing great sweetie

[887.579 - 892.26] all right

[888.779 - 895.32] no maitha has no is valid Json LD so it

[892.26 - 897.38] just made that up okay

[895.32 - 897.38] um

[897.66 - 900.74] let's see

[905.339 - 912.0600000000001] um let's see

[907.459 - 913.199] okay we got an error

[912.06 - 917.18] um

[913.199 - 917.18] are you sure this is a real function

[921.54 - 927.7199999999999] this might be harder than I thought

[924.3 - 929.88] chat gbt loading wheel

[927.72 - 930.59] I'm sorry Dave I can't let you ask that

[929.88 - 935.28] question Dave

[930.59 - 935.2800000000001] [Laughter]

[935.399 - 938.6] it's gonna get mad at me

[945.66 - 949.04] all right let's see if it works

[958.32 - 963.44] we might not even need to um validate it

[964.56 - 970.699] uh because if it if it does have a

[967.139 - 970.699] function that allows us to convert

[971.76 - 977.06] if Json LD error

[974.519 - 977.0600000000001] okay

[982.68 - 985.699] all right let's try this

[986.459 - 990.54] oh and also I just remembered that we

[988.68 - 991.9799999999999] need to replace

[990.54 - 993.68] we need to do

[991.98 - 996.0600000000001] um

[993.68 - 999.06] encoding equals

[996.06 - 999.06] utf-8

[999.6 - 1004.779] anytime we have an open

[1002.72 - 1004.779] um

[1004.94 - 1008.6600000000001] statement we need to do that because I

[1007.1 - 1011.48] encode everything in utf-8 all right

[1008.66 - 1015.38] let's try this again

[1011.48 - 1016.4590000000001] uh has no module validate that's fine

[1015.38 - 1019.639] um

[1016.459 - 1021.279] so in this case like it would be great

[1019.639 - 1026.059] if it had that function but it doesn't

[1021.279 - 1026.959] okay so do do do do

[1026.059 - 1030.52] um

[1026.959 - 1030.52] Let's ignore

[1031.16 - 1036.26] it didn't work either

[1033.699 - 1038.66] Let's ignore

[1036.26 - 1044.36] the validate step

[1038.66 - 1046.52] after all uh python pep 8 says it's or I

[1044.36 - 1050.12] don't know if it's pep 8 um

[1046.52 - 1052.04] uh python philosophy

[1050.12 - 1055.82] says

[1052.04 - 1057.6789999999999] it's better to ask forgiveness

[1055.82 - 1062.539] then permission

[1057.679 - 1064.22] so instead of validating let's just try

[1062.539 - 1068.539] to convert it

[1064.22 - 1070.16] directly to GIF X

[1068.539 - 1073.24] um

[1070.16 - 1073.24] is that the file type

[1073.96 - 1079.419] FX yeah so let's just try and convert it

[1077.48 - 1085.88] directly to GIF X

[1079.419 - 1087.5200000000002] again using a try accept Clause

[1085.88 - 1093.5800000000002] um

[1087.52 - 1093.58] uh I'd like you to update

[1096.559 - 1100.1789999999999] yeah

[1097.64 - 1100.179] dude

[1100.22 - 1107.6000000000001] I'd like you to update the try except

[1103.46 - 1111.799] Clauses to catch the errors and print

[1107.6 - 1114.6789999999999] them so I can see what happened

[1111.799 - 1118.34] so in total

[1114.679 - 1124.64] this script should be simpler

[1118.34 - 1129.74] um try to load the Json and then try to

[1124.64 - 1132.3200000000002] convert to GIF X in both steps I output

[1129.74 - 1133.22] any errors

[1132.32 - 1136.9399999999998] um

[1133.22 - 1139.82] if it is successful

[1136.94 - 1141.8600000000001] um actually yeah

[1139.82 - 1145.76] uh

[1141.86 - 1147.6789999999999] just print the results as we go for this

[1145.76 - 1149.299] script okay

[1147.679 - 1151.16] so let's see what it does so basically

[1149.299 - 1152.66] what I'm doing is I'm I'm having it

[1151.16 - 1153.98] write a script to do an experiment just

[1152.66 - 1157.16] to see if it'll get all the way through

[1153.98 - 1159.2] because since the cognitive labor is

[1157.16 - 1161.3600000000001] less on me I'm like just write this

[1159.2 - 1161.919] script let's see what happens right

[1161.36 - 1164.4189999999999] um

[1161.919 - 1166.8200000000002] as I was talking to some people about

[1164.419 - 1170.0] this kind of technology I realized we

[1166.82 - 1172.7] are infinitely closer to having Star

[1170.0 - 1174.86] Trek level computers than anyone

[1172.7 - 1176.96] realizes or maybe maybe we do realize

[1174.86 - 1179.8999999999999] that's why that's why it's uh it's

[1176.96 - 1182.0] exciting because with just a little bit

[1179.9 - 1183.44] more logic behind this I could say

[1182.0 - 1185.66] computer

[1183.44 - 1187.94] um download all the Supreme Court

[1185.66 - 1191.0] opinions uh about

[1187.94 - 1194.1200000000001] um about uh Anti-Trust laws you know and

[1191.0 - 1195.44] chat GPT says okay cool uh and I can if

[1194.12 - 1197.0] you give it an internet connection it

[1195.44 - 1199.64] can go find it and go find that data

[1197.0 - 1201.32] download it you say okay cool uh what's

[1199.64 - 1203.1200000000001] the what does the data look like you

[1201.32 - 1205.52] know computer says it's in PDF format

[1203.12 - 1207.3799999999999] cool scrape it and it goes from there

[1205.52 - 1208.52] and it says okay now what do you want me

[1207.38 - 1210.3200000000002] to do right and you just have a

[1208.52 - 1212.24] conversation with the machine this is

[1210.32 - 1215.0] capable of that just with a little bit

[1212.24 - 1218.559] more behind the scenes

[1215.0 - 1218.559] okay let's see

[1226.58 - 1229.36] excellent

[1231.14 - 1237.0800000000002] I love it so by it by rapidly iterating

[1234.44 - 1238.94] and I have done no coding except for

[1237.08 - 1240.26] adding the uh the encoding thing

[1238.94 - 1240.919] actually here

[1240.26 - 1243.2] um

[1240.919 - 1247.419] great

[1243.2 - 1251.66] I just need you to make one last change

[1247.419 - 1255.919] and that is to always include

[1251.66 - 1258.98] um encoding equals UTF

[1255.919 - 1261.3200000000002] actually I think it's lowercase utf-8

[1258.98 - 1264.94] um while

[1261.32 - 1270.1399999999999] opening reading and writing files

[1264.94 - 1271.22] everything is uh in UTF eight

[1270.14 - 1275.9] um

[1271.22 - 1278.66] so let's just set that as standard

[1275.9 - 1281.5] for all our Scripts

[1278.66 - 1281.5] Hello computer

[1282.02 - 1286.28] would that be worth something to you

[1284.12 - 1288.86] okay

[1286.28 - 1290.84] so if so I was when I was talking with

[1288.86 - 1293.0] Bax one of the things he said is he

[1290.84 - 1295.039] suspects that chat GPT has a scratch Pad

[1293.0 - 1296.48] so what does that mean in technical

[1295.039 - 1297.98] terms it doesn't mean that it's writing

[1296.48 - 1300.2] on a notepad although that would be cool

[1297.98 - 1302.78] but what it what it what it could mean

[1300.2 - 1305.179] is that if if it does have a sidebar

[1302.78 - 1307.7] document where it can remember critical

[1305.179 - 1311.0] pieces of information regardless of how

[1307.7 - 1312.38] long the conversation gets so

[1311.0 - 1314.36] um if it does have that then it's like

[1312.38 - 1316.8200000000002] hey let me just keep track of you know

[1314.36 - 1319.039] the top 10 most important facts about

[1316.82 - 1320.48] this conversation

[1319.039 - 1323.98] um

[1320.48 - 1323.98] but yeah let's see if it works

[1329.659 - 1332.9] all right

[1331.46 - 1334.7] cool

[1332.9 - 1336.74] so let's come back here

[1334.7 - 1340.76] and do this

[1336.74 - 1344.0] validate Json so look at this 28 lines

[1340.76 - 1346.46] not bad what am I doing run the script

[1344.0 - 1348.799] just run the script

[1346.46 - 1350.96] error while converting

[1348.799 - 1353.559] so it looked like all of them failed but

[1350.96 - 1353.559] it did something

[1354.44 - 1360.26] um yeah this is not bad not bad at all

[1357.5 - 1363.32] uh it what might behoove us

[1360.26 - 1365.96] so if I if if I were doing this project

[1363.32 - 1367.3999999999999] let's say for instance I I think I got

[1365.96 - 1369.38] as far as I can get but let me show you

[1367.4 - 1371.0590000000002] what I would do

[1369.38 - 1372.44] um so let's let's rewind a little bit

[1371.059 - 1374.24] because I think I think that this is

[1372.44 - 1375.26] just going to blow up

[1374.24 - 1377.059] um

[1375.26 - 1378.919] yeah I don't think it didn't succeed on

[1377.059 - 1380.96] a single one of them

[1378.919 - 1382.5800000000002] um so clearly there's some fragility

[1380.96 - 1384.919] here

[1382.58 - 1386.78] um we got to Json files but they're all

[1384.919 - 1389.6000000000001] inconsistent and they're all different

[1386.78 - 1392.12] sizes and so on so what we would need to

[1389.6 - 1394.6999999999998] do is when we're extracting the the

[1392.12 - 1397.82] knowledge graph what we would need to do

[1394.7 - 1398.96] is probably come here and specify a

[1397.82 - 1402.2] format

[1398.96 - 1404.3600000000001] now the problem here is if we use few

[1402.2 - 1405.799] shot so this is why I say we need fine

[1404.36 - 1407.6] tuning

[1405.799 - 1409.6399999999999] um if we use few shot we're going to run

[1407.6 - 1412.1] out of tokens and even if they double

[1409.64 - 1414.5590000000002] the token the token count we're still

[1412.1 - 1416.8999999999999] gonna like the more tokens we can fit in

[1414.559 - 1419.1789999999999] at once the better

[1416.9 - 1420.919] um and but now so there's Pro there's

[1419.179 - 1423.3200000000002] probably some intermediary steps right

[1420.919 - 1425.72] because rather than just going straight

[1423.32 - 1428.539] from documents to knowledge graphs which

[1425.72 - 1431.059] it worked right worked rather well but

[1428.539 - 1432.74] the process is fragile we might need to

[1431.059 - 1435.6789999999999] have other intermediary steps such as

[1432.74 - 1437.9] distilling the information down so let

[1435.679 - 1439.22] me let me show you what I mean by that

[1437.9 - 1442.4] um here let me pause it for just a

[1439.22 - 1444.799] second as I change workspaces

[1442.4 - 1446.96] okay we're right back all right so I

[1444.799 - 1448.7] took one of these chunks it's 7 600

[1446.96 - 1451.82] characters long

[1448.7 - 1455.0] um so rather than go straight to

[1451.82 - 1456.799] Knowledge Graph let's see let's do some

[1455.0 - 1459.14] prompt engineering and see because like

[1456.799 - 1462.98] we basically have to start over

[1459.14 - 1466.1000000000001] um all right so uh there's there's a lot

[1462.98 - 1467.84] of Superfluous information so

[1466.1 - 1470.0] um let's see how did I word this prompt

[1467.84 - 1470.78] this is a super valuable prompt by the

[1470.0 - 1473.179] way

[1470.78 - 1474.44] and I don't mind sharing it because I've

[1473.179 - 1477.26] talked to other people and they've

[1474.44 - 1479.059] figured it out so this is this is this

[1477.26 - 1480.679] is the most valuable one of the most

[1479.059 - 1484.94] valuable prompts I have ever figured out

[1480.679 - 1486.38] so write notes about the following uh

[1484.94 - 1487.22] document

[1486.38 - 1491.659] um

[1487.22 - 1495.44] uh let's see use bullet points

[1491.659 - 1497.179] um in complete sentences

[1495.44 - 1500.559] um I think that's all you need

[1497.179 - 1500.5590000000002] and then you say notes

[1505.039 - 1509.419] so this compression method

[1508.58 - 1512.96] um

[1509.419 - 1514.76] usually is like the best way to compress

[1512.96 - 1517.3400000000001] anything

[1514.76 - 1518.9] um yeah now one thing I don't like is

[1517.34 - 1521.6] that it actually used the actual bullet

[1518.9 - 1523.659] point character rather than a dash

[1521.6 - 1523.6589999999999] um

[1523.7 - 1527.299] use bullet points in complete sentences

[1525.74 - 1529.1] use

[1527.299 - 1531.679] um

[1529.1 - 1535.0] hyphen uh

[1531.679 - 1535.0] or the point

[1535.22 - 1540.32] so this is like you know blah blah so

[1538.46 - 1542.779] just it's a list of assertions Cedric

[1540.32 - 1545.059] Kushner promotions does this Don King is

[1542.779 - 1547.88] the president of that uh petitioner Don

[1545.059 - 1551.44] King allegedly that he had done this as

[1547.88 - 1551.44] a part through a RICO pattern

[1551.539 - 1557.6] petitioner Sue Don King but this is not

[1554.419 - 1559.159] good right this is the the so the the

[1557.6 - 1561.26] reason I'm okay with sharing this is

[1559.159 - 1564.6200000000001] because while this is a really powerful

[1561.26 - 1565.94] prompt it's not quite Universal and the

[1564.62 - 1567.559] reason that it's not Universal is

[1565.94 - 1570.98] because you still lose a little bit too

[1567.559 - 1573.74] much context and so you always have to

[1570.98 - 1575.419] modify this prompt

[1573.74 - 1578.659] um so the second circuit expressed The

[1575.419 - 1580.64] View that 1862 is blah blah blah

[1578.659 - 1582.7990000000002] um great so we're getting we're getting

[1580.64 - 1586.159] some of this but for instance we lost

[1582.799 - 1587.24] like the title right like what what is

[1586.159 - 1587.96] going on

[1587.24 - 1591.5] um

[1587.96 - 1593.6000000000001] so we we lost this so um we need to say

[1591.5 - 1595.88] like what is the document about we need

[1593.6 - 1600.08] to include all details

[1595.88 - 1604.159] um such as uh yeah so I'll just tell you

[1600.08 - 1608.12] include all details such as uh titles

[1604.159 - 1609.2] citations uh dates and so on

[1608.12 - 1611.6] um

[1609.2 - 1614.419] so that should work

[1611.6 - 1616.82] so from the last time

[1614.419 - 1618.919] um we stopped here right and then I've

[1616.82 - 1620.6589999999999] doubled the length of the instruction so

[1618.919 - 1622.7] I also want to point out this

[1620.659 - 1625.5800000000002] instruction would not work in text

[1622.7 - 1630.2] DaVinci O2 these instructions only work

[1625.58 - 1633.279] now with text DaVinci 03.

[1630.2 - 1633.279] all right so let's see what happens

[1634.4 - 1639.2] there we go

[1636.32 - 1641.96] see how the sentences are much longer

[1639.2 - 1644.539] so Cedric Kushner Productions uh V King

[1641.96 - 1645.679] is a case from October term 2000 which

[1644.539 - 1647.9] the Supreme Court of the United States

[1645.679 - 1649.3400000000001] reversed and remanded the decision of

[1647.9 - 1652.4] the United States courts of appeals for

[1649.34 - 1654.6789999999999] the second circuit bam perfect

[1652.4 - 1656.48] perfect so this is the kind of

[1654.679 - 1658.7] information it's almost even written

[1656.48 - 1662.059] like a lawyer would speak right this

[1658.7 - 1664.159] tells you real fast in very plain

[1662.059 - 1667.1] language what happened

[1664.159 - 1671.2990000000002] so this is information that that is one

[1667.1 - 1673.039] useful and two could be embedded in a um

[1671.299 - 1675.08] in a knowledge graph or could be used to

[1673.039 - 1676.7] extract the information now let me show

[1675.08 - 1678.32] you something

[1676.7 - 1680.0] um

[1678.32 - 1682.82] so actually this is actually a really

[1680.0 - 1683.539] good prompt I'm going to save this

[1682.82 - 1685.1] um

[1683.539 - 1686.9] whenever you come up with a really good

[1685.1 - 1688.779] prompt save it

[1686.9 - 1692.8400000000001] um

[1688.779 - 1694.9] prompt notes detailed

[1692.84 - 1694.8999999999999] um

[1695.24 - 1703.419] yeah so we took we took let me let's do

[1698.72 - 1703.419] some token counts so we took uh

[1706.7 - 1710.96] all right so without it it is 1966

[1709.64 - 1713.2990000000002] tokens

[1710.96 - 1717.38] and then we combat we compress that down

[1713.299 - 1720.26] to 221 tokens so we got a um a

[1717.38 - 1722.96] compression ratio of almost 10 to 1 and

[1720.26 - 1725.48] we kept the most saline details and

[1722.96 - 1728.48] those Salient details were were kept

[1725.48 - 1730.46] with enough context that like it's still

[1728.48 - 1733.46] useful like you read this and it's like

[1730.46 - 1735.3400000000001] oh this is a great executive summary

[1733.46 - 1737.8400000000001] um so there you go

[1735.34 - 1740.02] uh so that this is probably the

[1737.84 - 1742.58] direction that I would go like rewind

[1740.02 - 1745.6399999999999] let's take this and instead of going to

[1742.58 - 1748.6399999999999] Json let's try and do this with uh with

[1745.64 - 1749.48] um uh gex F uh I think you guys get the

[1748.64 - 1751.46] point

[1749.48 - 1754.279] um and also we're already like at 30

[1751.46 - 1756.44] minutes so we'll say that we uh we'll

[1754.279 - 1758.0] call this a partial success we got

[1756.44 - 1761.24] really far

[1758.0 - 1764.539] um we got uh exceptional use of of chat

[1761.24 - 1766.94] GPT we found a huge fragility

[1764.539 - 1769.8799999999999] um it was confabulating uh modules and

[1766.94 - 1772.039] functions that didn't exist now

[1769.88 - 1774.2] this isn't necessarily a bad thing so

[1772.039 - 1776.74] let me tell you why is because it used

[1774.2 - 1779.299] its imagination and I'm anthropical and

[1776.74 - 1781.82] anthropomorphizing it on purpose it used

[1779.299 - 1783.62] its imagination to imagine this is what

[1781.82 - 1784.8799999999999] we would need and then it just kind of

[1783.62 - 1788.0] went and looked for it

[1784.88 - 1789.8600000000001] now here's the thing it doesn't take a

[1788.0 - 1791.659] whole lot of cognitive architecture to

[1789.86 - 1793.6999999999998] find those mistakes and then say

[1791.659 - 1795.3200000000002] actually this is something that would be

[1793.7 - 1797.779] great if it existed why don't I go write

[1795.32 - 1799.8799999999999] it right and so then it you know it

[1797.779 - 1802.159] keeps track of its dependencies it could

[1799.88 - 1804.38] write its own user stories right say

[1802.159 - 1805.8200000000002] here actually let me just show you

[1804.38 - 1809.48] um okay

[1805.82 - 1813.6789999999999] um uh think about everything that didn't

[1809.48 - 1816.32] work write some user stories

[1813.679 - 1820.64] um to submit to various

[1816.32 - 1825.799] uh projects like Pi LD

[1820.64 - 1825.7990000000002] um and network x uh

[1826.039 - 1831.44] um

[1827.419 - 1834.22] uh that would have made this project

[1831.44 - 1834.22] easier

[1836.059 - 1840.44] I think this is going to work because

[1837.86 - 1841.8799999999999] here's the thing by breaking it down

[1840.44 - 1843.8600000000001] into steps

[1841.88 - 1846.2] there we go

[1843.86 - 1848.6] yes yes yes look at this look at this

[1846.2 - 1850.76] look at this okay so even if something

[1848.6 - 1852.62] doesn't work it doesn't have to

[1850.76 - 1855.799] necessarily fix it

[1852.62 - 1857.7199999999998] um live in Vivo right this is the

[1855.799 - 1860.179] process that we follow as humans there's

[1857.72 - 1864.799] no need to actually just like

[1860.179 - 1866.8400000000001] um excuse me to to fix it live it's I

[1864.799 - 1868.7] ran into a problem let's fire this off

[1866.84 - 1870.08] and then have another system integrate

[1868.7 - 1873.559] these

[1870.08 - 1874.82] um look at this oh man oh man as a

[1873.559 - 1876.5] developer I want to be able to validate

[1874.82 - 1878.059] Json LD data without having to manually

[1876.5 - 1880.46] Catch Air so that I can quickly identify

[1878.059 - 1881.6] and fix issues with my data yes as a

[1880.46 - 1883.94] developer I want to be able to easily

[1881.6 - 1885.1399999999999] convert Json LD data to a standardized

[1883.94 - 1886.3990000000001] format so that I can process and

[1885.14 - 1889.22] visualize the data consistently

[1886.399 - 1891.86] regardless of its original format yes

[1889.22 - 1893.419] perfect developer story or user story as

[1891.86 - 1895.039] a developer I want to have simple and

[1893.419 - 1896.659] intuitive way to create and save

[1895.039 - 1899.0] knowledge graphs in a variety of formats

[1896.659 - 1900.2] such as gex F so that I can use the tool

[1899.0 - 1902.419] that is most suitable for my needs

[1900.2 - 1904.3400000000001] excellent Universal converter as a

[1902.419 - 1906.14] developer I want to have access to to a

[1904.34 - 1907.6399999999999] wide range of layout algorithms and

[1906.14 - 1908.96] visualization options so they can create

[1907.64 - 1910.5800000000002] clear and informative visuals of my

[1908.96 - 1912.559] knowledge graphs that's already solved

[1910.58 - 1914.0] but great as a developer I want to be

[1912.559 - 1915.08] able to easily filter and analyze my

[1914.0 - 1916.82] knowledge graph so that I can gain

[1915.08 - 1920.12] insights into the relationships between

[1916.82 - 1923.86] different nodes and edges fantastic

[1920.12 - 1923.86] these first four or three

[1924.32 - 1928.76] um

[1926.0 - 1930.559] perfect okay I'm gonna stop here because

[1928.76 - 1932.419] I'm about to go down a really deep

[1930.559 - 1933.86] rabbit hole but I think I know what my

[1932.419 - 1937.22] next videos are going to be and that is

[1933.86 - 1939.1399999999999] using chat GPT for every aspect of the

[1937.22 - 1943.279] development life cycle we're going to

[1939.14 - 1946.3990000000001] explore agile cicd web native all that

[1943.279 - 1949.12] because this is incredible alright

[1946.399 - 1949.12] thanks for watching
