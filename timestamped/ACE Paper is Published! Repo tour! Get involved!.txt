[0.0 - 6.839] good morning everybody it is here the

[4.08 - 9.599] ace framework project is up and running

[6.839 - 11.760000000000002] and so today what I'm going to do is I'm

[9.599 - 13.38] going to walk you through the repo uh

[11.76 - 16.439999999999998] tell you about the project where we're

[13.38 - 19.26] at how you can participate and the road

[16.44 - 21.119] map from here so first uh the first

[19.26 - 23.64] thing that you'll see when you go to the

[21.119 - 26.58] ace framework that's uh Dave shop Ace

[23.64 - 27.779] framework is uh the repo is relatively

[26.58 - 30.72] small right now we don't have any

[27.779 - 32.7] examples I've got the core team together

[30.72 - 35.519999999999996] and we are brainstorming we're meeting

[32.7 - 37.800000000000004] soon uh to come up with some technical

[35.52 - 40.739000000000004] Milestones some designs and other

[37.8 - 42.3] organizational things the readme is

[40.739 - 44.339999999999996] relatively short and straightforward

[42.3 - 45.36] this is more of a guide to the rest of

[44.34 - 47.940000000000005] the repo

[45.36 - 50.34] so I've got a link directly to the

[47.94 - 51.839999999999996] framework itself here I've got some

[50.34 - 54.0] information about how to participate

[51.84 - 56.699000000000005] there's a few resources here which we'll

[54.0 - 60.12] get into then of course the overarching

[56.699 - 61.98] uh architecture of the ace framework and

[60.12 - 64.5] then finally some projects so this is

[61.98 - 65.58] where we'll start to dive in so if

[64.5 - 67.02] you're not familiar with the ace

[65.58 - 70.67999999999999] framework it stands for autonomous

[67.02 - 72.24] cognitive entity and the uh basically

[70.68 - 74.10000000000001] what this is it is a cognitive

[72.24 - 78.41999999999999] architecture a software architecture

[74.1 - 80.64] that is meant to work with llms and then

[78.42 - 83.22] when they're available multimodal models

[80.64 - 86.82] that will allow us to create fully

[83.22 - 90.0] autonomous entities such as personal

[86.82 - 92.939] assistants or companions Game World NPCs

[90.0 - 94.92] autonomous employees or embodied robots

[92.939 - 97.13999999999999] so those are the four overarching

[94.92 - 99.6] categories of ways that the ace

[97.14 - 101.57900000000001] framework can be implemented and so the

[99.6 - 103.5] team that I that I've built we've all

[101.579 - 105.119] agreed that we're going to start with

[103.5 - 106.32] the personal assistant and or companion

[105.119 - 108.72] for first

[106.32 - 110.46] so basically this is going to be a

[108.72 - 112.79899999999999] personal executive assistant that is

[110.46 - 115.079] capable of one thinking entirely

[112.799 - 117.72000000000001] autonomously to meet your needs without

[115.079 - 120.05999999999999] necessarily waiting for you to give any

[117.72 - 121.38] instructions so this is what we mean

[120.06 - 123.119] when I say fully autonomous because

[121.38 - 125.1] there's a lot of times that I'll say

[123.119 - 126.42] like oh yeah this is this is to create

[125.1 - 128.57999999999998] autonomous entities and they're like

[126.42 - 130.8] what do you mean by autonomy just think

[128.58 - 132.36] like robot think you know the Nestor

[130.8 - 134.52] classify from iRobot think about

[132.36 - 136.62] Commander Data from Star Trek think

[134.52 - 138.239] about all these uh think about Samantha

[136.62 - 139.98000000000002] from the movie her which I just

[138.239 - 142.70000000000002] re-watched which man

[139.98 - 145.56] that movie hits different today

[142.7 - 147.42] 10 years ago when her came out with

[145.56 - 149.64000000000001] Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson

[147.42 - 151.07999999999998] it was all speculation now it's being

[149.64 - 153.599] realized so that movie really hits

[151.08 - 157.5] different anyways point being is the

[153.599 - 159.48] idea here is to create machines that can

[157.5 - 162.72] think on their own that can set their

[159.48 - 165.0] own goals and objectives but to do so in

[162.72 - 166.85999999999999] a structured way that uh basically means

[165.0 - 169.379] that it won't hurt you or become toxic

[166.86 - 171.66000000000003] or dangerous or destructive so those are

[169.379 - 173.819] the four overarching categories that

[171.66 - 175.5] we're going to be pursuing uh within

[173.819 - 179.16] this project now let me give you a tour

[175.5 - 180.72] of the rest of the repo so right at the

[179.16 - 181.68] base layer I've got the ace framework

[180.72 - 184.379] here

[181.68 - 186.0] so the ace framework this is the this is

[184.379 - 190.92] the Deep dive into all of the layers

[186.0 - 192.12] with diagrams uh examples and so on

[190.92 - 193.379] um this was the first thing that I

[192.12 - 195.78] introduced so you're probably familiar

[193.379 - 198.35999999999999] with that uh the readme that's the page

[195.78 - 201.599] that we're on here I've added an agile

[198.36 - 203.70000000000002] chart so basically this is uh showing

[201.599 - 205.2] one how we're organizing the project as

[203.7 - 208.73899999999998] well as the roadmap so if you're not

[205.2 - 210.54] familiar with agile agile is a software

[208.739 - 213.48000000000002] development Paradigm that focuses on

[210.54 - 215.7] small teams and Rapid Improvement so

[213.48 - 218.099] what we're starting with is an MVP which

[215.7 - 220.61999999999998] means minimum viable product or POC

[218.099 - 222.29899999999998] which is proof of concept and so the

[220.62 - 224.519] very first thing that the team and I are

[222.299 - 226.68] going to be building is just like the

[224.519 - 229.08] simplest most cut down version that says

[226.68 - 231.65900000000002] hey it works that's the that's the goal

[229.08 - 234.18] here so the acceptance criteria that I

[231.659 - 236.459] have established for the MVP is it'll be

[234.18 - 239.15900000000002] python so it'll either be entirely

[236.459 - 241.68] python or mostly Python Meaning that

[239.159 - 243.84] it'll be more accessible to people

[241.68 - 245.459] it needs to be hackable meaning it's

[243.84 - 248.64000000000001] going to be built in such a way that it

[245.459 - 250.92000000000002] is easier to copy paste edit reconfigure

[248.64 - 252.599] so on and so forth because again the

[250.92 - 254.04] whole point of the MVP is just to show

[252.599 - 256.38] that it works and also make it more

[254.04 - 259.739] accessible to everyone else

[256.38 - 262.32] simple and easy uh again we want we want

[259.739 - 264.23999999999995] this to be as brain dead simple as as

[262.32 - 267.0] possible to set up and start and start

[264.24 - 268.68] playing with because again the idea is

[267.0 - 270.66] this is just to demonstrate

[268.68 - 273.3] functionality to demonstrate that it

[270.66 - 275.34000000000003] actually works that it's not just Theory

[273.3 - 278.40000000000003] um and so to that one thing that I want

[275.34 - 280.61999999999995] to say very quickly is that uh all the

[278.4 - 282.96] components of the ace framework have all

[280.62 - 286.1] been done but what I'm doing is I'm

[282.96 - 288.84] bringing it all together uh so

[286.1 - 291.54] as anyone who has built anything that is

[288.84 - 293.09999999999997] large and complicated knows that all the

[291.54 - 294.78000000000003] pieces might work independently but

[293.1 - 297.3] plugging them into each other that can

[294.78 - 298.55999999999995] be the hard part acceptance criteria

[297.3 - 300.41900000000004] number four is that there has to be some

[298.56 - 302.28000000000003] kind of visual component meaning that

[300.419 - 303.9] you can see it working or interact with

[302.28 - 305.09999999999997] it in a visual way

[303.9 - 307.19899999999996] um rather than just seeing code

[305.1 - 309.06] scrolling across the screen and then

[307.199 - 310.56] finally the the fifth acceptance

[309.06 - 312.9] criteria is that it must be a full

[310.56 - 316.44] implementation of all six layers and

[312.9 - 318.06] both both buses of the ace framework and

[316.44 - 320.04] if you're not if you're not if you're

[318.06 - 321.36] new to this and you're not uh sure of

[320.04 - 323.639] what I'm talking about when I say layers

[321.36 - 326.639] and buses you can take a quick look at

[323.639 - 327.84000000000003] the at the architectural diagram here so

[326.639 - 330.78000000000003] there are six layers they're

[327.84 - 333.59999999999997] hierarchical layers which basically is

[330.78 - 336.11999999999995] an order of operations in terms of uh

[333.6 - 338.759] what what handles what aspect and then

[336.12 - 340.5] there's a Northbound bust which is uh

[338.759 - 341.88] bringing Telemetry into the uh

[340.5 - 343.979] environment and then there's the

[341.88 - 345.12] southbound bus Which is the control

[343.979 - 348.24] scheme

[345.12 - 350.52] so the MVP must Implement all eight of

[348.24 - 352.199] those components uh not necessarily

[350.52 - 354.24] we're not we're not necessarily focusing

[352.199 - 355.5] on input and output yet the primary

[354.24 - 357.539] thing is that we need to create a

[355.5 - 359.639] thinking machine something that is that

[357.539 - 361.56] is uh forming structured thoughts and

[359.639 - 364.5] plans and so on

[361.56 - 367.08] um okay so that is the agile here's the

[364.5 - 369.12] contributing document uh so basically

[367.08 - 370.62] there's a few ways to contribute uh

[369.12 - 372.32] we've got the discussions tab which I'll

[370.62 - 375.419] show and show you in just a second

[372.32 - 376.86] there's also my Discord and patreon

[375.419 - 379.19899999999996] community so if you want a private

[376.86 - 381.3] Community I do have a I do have an ace

[379.199 - 384.84000000000003] framework tab set up in that Community

[381.3 - 386.94] uh just if anyone wants to jump in uh

[384.84 - 388.61999999999995] talk about it also I've had a few people

[386.94 - 390.6] reach out who want to consult on it

[388.62 - 393.479] because obviously I am not the only

[390.6 - 395.58000000000004] person doing autonomous agents and so on

[393.479 - 398.3] and so forth and so several of my

[395.58 - 400.74] clients particularly my newer clients

[398.3 - 403.259] have reached out and they want they want

[400.74 - 405.12] me to you know provide uh coaching or

[403.259 - 406.97900000000004] consultation on their architectures and

[405.12 - 410.1] and I'm happy to do so so that's another

[406.979 - 411.479] way to get involved now one thing that I

[410.1 - 414.24] do want to point out is that the the

[411.479 - 416.81899999999996] core team the initial team we do have

[414.24 - 419.039] that set up however there is a huge

[416.819 - 420.90000000000003] amount of interest in this project and

[419.039 - 422.479] so part of what I'm doing on the agile

[420.9 - 425.88] chart over here

[422.479 - 428.52] is defining how we're going to have this

[425.88 - 431.1] open source distributed uh project

[428.52 - 432.96] moving forward so the core team will

[431.1 - 434.58000000000004] consist of myself and the core team that

[432.96 - 436.85999999999996] I've already built

[434.58 - 438.24] um and then essentially what what I'll

[436.86 - 440.40000000000003] recommend obviously I'm not going to

[438.24 - 441.78000000000003] tell anyone what to do but for all the

[440.4 - 443.34] people that are reaching out that have

[441.78 - 445.5] particular implementations that they

[443.34 - 447.0] want to do the idea is that I'll

[445.5 - 448.68] recommend that you build an individual

[447.0 - 451.259] scrum team which is a team that is

[448.68 - 453.419] capped at seven seven people maximum and

[451.259 - 454.86] that you start with a lead developer so

[453.419 - 457.68] the lead developer is the one who's

[454.86 - 459.84000000000003] going to kind of Drive the vision and

[457.68 - 462.419] and focus on making sure that everything

[459.84 - 465.419] happens but then within the core team

[462.419 - 468.12] we'll have myself as a product owner and

[465.419 - 469.62] then we'll also have probably one or

[468.12 - 471.78000000000003] more scrum Masters I've already had

[469.62 - 473.58] several people volunteer to serve as

[471.78 - 475.44] scrum Masters and so if you're not

[473.58 - 477.0] familiar with a scrum Master the pretty

[475.44 - 478.919] much the role of the scrum Master is the

[477.0 - 481.56] master of ceremony the one who

[478.919 - 484.08] understands the process of Agile

[481.56 - 486.12] development and so they they basically

[484.08 - 488.099] like the train conductor that helps keep

[486.12 - 489.0] all the developers on track within a

[488.099 - 490.44] team

[489.0 - 492.66] um and it's basically what a scrum

[490.44 - 494.639] Master does is we'll sit in with with

[492.66 - 496.5] the scrum team of developers of seven

[494.639 - 498.419] developers maximum seven developers it

[496.5 - 500.16] doesn't have to be seven the scrum

[498.419 - 502.37899999999996] Master will sit in and provide guidance

[500.16 - 504.0] of like okay here's what you here's

[502.379 - 505.8] here's how you figure out what to do

[504.0 - 508.74] first here's how you conduct the

[505.8 - 511.379] meetings so on and so forth and so the

[508.74 - 512.76] idea here is that once we have the core

[511.379 - 514.44] team set up

[512.76 - 518.459] um those of us on the core team will be

[514.44 - 520.5] available to other folks who have uh who

[518.459 - 522.38] basically want a little bit of help and

[520.5 - 524.64] guidance implementing an open source

[522.38 - 527.82] implementation of Ace one of the four

[524.64 - 532.3199999999999] kinds that we just talked about and the

[527.82 - 535.019] idea is that uh as as as a community we

[532.32 - 536.88] will learn how to uh some best practices

[535.019 - 538.92] around how to implement this and we'll

[536.88 - 541.7] be able to share but the idea is that

[538.92 - 545.519] this this repository will be the primary

[541.7 - 547.74] uh like Nexus of learning how to deploy

[545.519 - 549.18] these autonomous cognitive entities so

[547.74 - 551.279] that's the agile and contributing

[549.18 - 553.62] documents I definitely recommend you

[551.279 - 556.68] take a look at those and then finally

[553.62 - 559.68] there's a resources document so here I

[556.68 - 561.779] captured a list of books at the top so

[559.68 - 564.3] there's a cognition Psychology and

[561.779 - 566.519] Neuroscience and then there's several

[564.3 - 568.92] Concepts and Frameworks such as Maslow's

[566.519 - 570.72] hierarchy of needs um and all the other

[568.92 - 573.4799999999999] kind of models that went into the

[570.72 - 575.519] inspiration behind Ace so this is it

[573.48 - 577.5] this is basically like a very very short

[575.519 - 579.36] citation page

[577.5 - 581.459] um and then finally I'll be accumulating

[579.36 - 584.22] YouTube videos

[581.459 - 586.26] um that uh that demonstrate the ace

[584.22 - 587.76] framework whether it's projects or

[586.26 - 589.62] breakdowns or whatever so there's mine

[587.76 - 591.66] and then synaptic Labs already produced

[589.62 - 593.279] a much shorter kind of introduction to

[591.66 - 594.899] the ace framework so thank you guys for

[593.279 - 596.58] doing that oh and they did that

[594.899 - 598.14] completely without like my permission or

[596.58 - 600.899] anything it's open source this is all

[598.14 - 602.459] under the MIT license and then finally

[600.899 - 604.68] the big thing that everyone has been

[602.459 - 608.64] waiting for is the publication

[604.68 - 610.8] so the uh the paper is here it is it's

[608.64 - 612.779] not yet up on archive

[610.8 - 615.3599999999999] um but I was given permission by the

[612.779 - 618.779] professor to go ahead and announce it so

[615.36 - 620.64] this is the actual publication that I

[618.779 - 622.92] partnered with Clemson University they

[620.64 - 625.019] actually reached out to me because their

[622.92 - 627.4799999999999] work is very parallel to what I'm doing

[625.019 - 630.0] so I want to send a huge thank you to

[627.48 - 631.86] Carlos Manuel and Wang Fon over at the

[630.0 - 634.14] human AI empowerment Lab at Clemson

[631.86 - 635.64] University so the paper is here it's

[634.14 - 637.64] ready you can download it it is

[635.64 - 640.459] incredibly well cited I think we have

[637.64 - 645.06] over 150 citations

[640.459 - 645.8389999999999] so we uh it's not we we didn't make this

[645.06 - 648.5999999999999] up

[645.839 - 650.7] um but there is a tremendous amount to

[648.6 - 653.4590000000001] unpack here so obviously I'm not gonna

[650.7 - 656.1] read all 37 pages of the paper to you

[653.459 - 658.68] but if you work through this the

[656.1 - 661.38] scientific paper you'll understand the

[658.68 - 663.68] psychology the philosophy the ethics

[661.38 - 666.72] uh and a lot of the other science

[663.68 - 668.8199999999999] underpinning the ace framework so it is

[666.72 - 671.339] there it is ready this is the big

[668.82 - 673.6800000000001] announcement and then I've also got a

[671.339 - 675.4200000000001] few other uh papers in the Publications

[673.68 - 677.3389999999999] page these are not all from me that's

[675.42 - 680.579] the only one that that I participated in

[677.339 - 682.9200000000001] but these are the most relevant uh

[680.579 - 685.38] papers that I have found so I've got a

[682.92 - 688.14] principal driven self-alignment

[685.38 - 690.959] um with minimal human supervision so

[688.14 - 693.42] basically this this kind of thing uh

[690.959 - 695.64] this paper is included because it one it

[693.42 - 698.459] comes from uh Carnegie Mellon and MIT

[695.64 - 700.92] IBM Watson AI lab so these are some

[698.459 - 703.38] serious folks but the idea here is to

[700.92 - 705.06] show that uh that you can have principal

[703.38 - 706.92] driven self-alignment so this will be

[705.06 - 711.0] specifically germane to the aspirational

[706.92 - 713.9399999999999] layer and the uh um agent model layer so

[711.0 - 715.98] layer one and layer three in order to

[713.94 - 717.9590000000001] understand how to keep these things on

[715.98 - 720.48] track autonomously

[717.959 - 722.8199999999999] another publication is the koala paper

[720.48 - 724.32] that I mentioned in a recent video

[722.82 - 725.0400000000001] um so this came out of Princeton and

[724.32 - 727.86] actually

[725.04 - 729.0] um the uh the professor uh Carlos who

[727.86 - 731.94] reached out to me he's friends with

[729.0 - 733.68] these guys uh over at Princeton so he

[731.94 - 735.0600000000001] collaborates with them

[733.68 - 738.06] um we're all operating in the same space

[735.06 - 741.18] the rain paper just came out so this is

[738.06 - 744.1199999999999] this is again about self-alignment

[741.18 - 746.459] um that uh that demonstrates uh

[744.12 - 748.64] prompting strategies for self-alignment

[746.459 - 751.9799999999999] even without fine-tuning so again

[748.64 - 754.1999999999999] definitely directly relevant to

[751.98 - 756.3000000000001] um to the ace framework and then I

[754.2 - 759.36] already showed you the Ace paper and

[756.3 - 761.76] then an older one is uh Jan lacunz

[759.36 - 763.32] um paper about the Ami his his

[761.76 - 766.019] architecture

[763.32 - 767.339] um I'm not particularly a fan of of this

[766.019 - 768.779] architecture which I've mentioned before

[767.339 - 771.0] so I'm not going to get into that again

[768.779 - 773.3389999999999] but I figured it would be good to have

[771.0 - 775.26] here just so that you know by ver by

[773.339 - 777.5400000000001] virtue of contrast and even though I'm

[775.26 - 780.54] not I don't necessarily agree with this

[777.54 - 783.06] it still good to see like what the state

[780.54 - 786.36] of the industry is okay cool so that is

[783.06 - 788.16] a full tour of the repository here

[786.36 - 790.32] um the other part of the of the whole

[788.16 - 793.079] repo is the discussions tab so this is

[790.32 - 794.7600000000001] the main tab that I want to end on which

[793.079 - 796.26] is you can see we've already had some

[794.76 - 798.72] robust discussion

[796.26 - 801.06] we've got people bringing up safety

[798.72 - 802.8000000000001] concerns we've got people

[801.06 - 805.6199999999999] um under like trying to understand what

[802.8 - 807.54] it would look like uh all kinds of

[805.62 - 809.04] thoughts so this is basically an open

[807.54 - 810.3] invitation

[809.04 - 812.279] um if you just want to learn about it

[810.3 - 814.38] like if you uh if you have like dumb

[812.279 - 815.9399999999999] questions or Noob questions come to the

[814.38 - 817.38] Q a section

[815.94 - 820.019] um and we'll be sure and it's not just

[817.38 - 823.32] me it's other members of the team are uh

[820.019 - 825.3] jumping in uh and answering questions uh

[823.32 - 827.22] so whether it's you've got questions

[825.3 - 828.959] whether you want to share so the show

[827.22 - 831.0] and tell section if you've got an

[828.959 - 833.279] implementation you want to share or a

[831.0 - 835.74] demonstration feel free to post it here

[833.279 - 838.38] the whole idea again is that the ace

[835.74 - 839.82] framework repository is going to be at

[838.38 - 842.66] least for the foreseeable future the

[839.82 - 845.1600000000001] Nexus of development for this framework

[842.66 - 847.68] and then eventually like again it's

[845.16 - 849.3] fully open source I I you probably

[847.68 - 851.88] remember from past projects I don't

[849.3 - 853.9799999999999] really have a desire to monetize this or

[851.88 - 856.74] keep control of it the entire purpose

[853.98 - 858.48] here is to teach and December eliminate

[856.74 - 861.54] this information and make it accessible

[858.48 - 864.0600000000001] as accessible as possible to everyone so

[861.54 - 865.4399999999999] that is where we're at thanks for

[864.06 - 868.3199999999999] watching

[865.44 - 869.519] um yeah this this is it jump in

[868.32 - 871.2600000000001] um you can also reach out to me on

[869.519 - 873.66] LinkedIn if you want to collaborate I've

[871.26 - 876.3] had quite a few other researchers want

[873.66 - 878.76] to collaborate on a similar and parallel

[876.3 - 881.639] projects uh specifically Germaine to

[878.76 - 883.62] chat Bots I've also been collaborating

[881.639 - 886.5600000000001] with people in various governments

[883.62 - 889.98] around the world to talk about Ai and AI

[886.56 - 892.8599999999999] narratives as well as how to generate

[889.98 - 894.9590000000001] buy-in one of my several of my recent

[892.86 - 897.1800000000001] clients uh and and friends and

[894.959 - 899.579] connections they are building AI

[897.18 - 902.2199999999999] startups that that interface with the

[899.579 - 904.68] government so this is another uh area of

[902.22 - 906.6] of uh interest that I have because

[904.68 - 907.8599999999999] obviously like you can have the best

[906.6 - 910.019] tools in the world but if the government

[907.86 - 912.12] isn't using it or the government isn't

[910.019 - 913.5600000000001] aware of how to use it correctly it kind

[912.12 - 915.6] of doesn't matter for the rest of us

[913.56 - 918.1199999999999] obviously business and government are

[915.6 - 920.279] different but we need one of my missions

[918.12 - 922.139] is to bring everyone to the table that

[920.279 - 923.639] means independent people that means

[922.139 - 925.6800000000001] businesses that means governments

[923.639 - 927.48] because you know if we're all if we're

[925.68 - 930.18] all on the same page we're all going to

[927.48 - 931.5] end up in a much better place so thanks

[930.18 - 933.4799999999999] for watching

[931.5 - 934.92] um I'm I'm going to be posting a little

[933.48 - 936.66] bit less

[934.92 - 938.459] um I'm moving over to medium just

[936.66 - 939.779] because I have so much content that I

[938.459 - 941.699] want to produce

[939.779 - 943.86] um and on that note I'm actually also

[941.699 - 947.2199999999999] building a video team then this is not

[943.86 - 949.5600000000001] it this is not a uh a request to join

[947.22 - 951.72] um the team is already built uh and

[949.56 - 953.76] we're just kind of uh dotting our eyes

[951.72 - 955.9200000000001] and crossing our T's so my production

[953.76 - 958.88] quality is about to go up and I'll we'll

[955.92 - 962.0999999999999] probably also have a co-host here soon

[958.88 - 964.74] uh so we're gonna we're gonna focus on

[962.1 - 966.839] more interviews we're going to focus on

[964.74 - 968.519] more of these open source projects we're

[966.839 - 969.72] going to focus more on education and

[968.519 - 972.0] tutorials

[969.72 - 973.98] but again the key thing is I'm going to

[972.0 - 976.44] have more help because basically I've

[973.98 - 978.24] been completely inundated by the sheer

[976.44 - 980.5790000000001] volume of stuff that I want to do and

[978.24 - 982.26] that I cannot do on myself and I finally

[980.579 - 983.9399999999999] got over myself and said you know what

[982.26 - 985.74] let me talk to some of these guys who

[983.94 - 988.5] are offering to help and let's get this

[985.74 - 991.0790000000001] going anyways I'm rambling now thanks

[988.5 - 992.88] for watching like And subscribe etc etc

[991.079 - 994.62] you know the drill but let's get this

[992.88 - 996.36] work done let's build some autonomous

[994.62 - 999.3] machines let's build some real life

[996.36 - 1001.339] cortana's and uh Samantha's and whatever

[999.3 - 1004.459] else and let's let's make the world a

[1001.339 - 1006.3800000000001] really cool future where we have uh

[1004.459 - 1009.1389999999999] these fully autonomous machines that can

[1006.38 - 1011.18] help us and make our lives better and uh

[1009.139 - 1013.639] you know ideally not kill us but you

[1011.18 - 1016.0] know wish in one hand all right I'm done

[1013.639 - 1016.0] later
