[0.64 - 7.7589999999999995] hey everybody david shapiro here um i

[3.84 - 9.36] had an idea so i posted on reddit and

[7.759 - 13.04] also the um

[9.36 - 15.518999999999998] the uh open ai forum this idea because

[13.04 - 18.0] people keep asking me um if i will

[15.519 - 20.240000000000002] consult and i don't want to consult uh

[18.0 - 22.48] for paid gigs

[20.24 - 24.72] mostly i just want ideas

[22.48 - 26.64] uh that's how i you know solving tough

[24.72 - 28.4] problems is how i learn

[26.64 - 30.64] and uh so i had this idea send me your

[28.4 - 32.0] gpt3 prop or your gpt problems i'll

[30.64 - 33.28] solve them for free and make a youtube

[32.0 - 35.44] video

[33.28 - 37.760000000000005] so basically i said okay you know what

[35.44 - 40.16] problems do you want me to solve

[37.76 - 42.239] and this guy storyghost aia said i would

[40.16 - 44.239] be interested in a gpt3 generated

[42.239 - 46.64] actionable feedback or constructive

[44.239 - 48.07899999999999] criticism at the stylistic level not

[46.64 - 49.6] spell check or grammar mistakes might

[48.079 - 51.52] use cases for fiction writing but any

[49.6 - 53.199] type of writing would do for instance if

[51.52 - 55.36] the original sentence is he was super in

[53.199 - 56.719] love with her like a lot the ideal gpt3

[55.36 - 58.32] completion would be something like

[56.719 - 59.76] provide an example that shows the depth

[58.32 - 60.879] of his love instead of just telling the

[59.76 - 62.32] reader

[60.879 - 65.51899999999999] also the writing comes across as

[62.32 - 68.4] informal with the word like okay so

[65.519 - 70.08000000000001] basically looking for a prose editor or

[68.4 - 72.96000000000001] a line editor

[70.08 - 74.88] or copy editor uh so i was like yeah

[72.96 - 76.88] let's do it

[74.88 - 79.119] before i get too far in this video i do

[76.88 - 81.6] have to warn you that um i'm about at my

[79.119 - 83.119] quota uh because i've been making these

[81.6 - 85.28] videos like crazy and i was like where

[83.119 - 86.64] did all this money go um because i was

[85.28 - 88.08] looking at this and it's like okay you

[86.64 - 90.479] know twenty six dollars thirty two

[88.08 - 92.479] dollars forty dollars fifty sixty

[90.479 - 94.079] seventy dollars then i jump up to a

[92.479 - 96.4] hundred and fourteen dollars and then up

[94.079 - 99.439] to 157 so i was like

[96.4 - 101.759] where did i use all this money um

[99.439 - 104.63999999999999] turns out the novel writing fine tuning

[101.759 - 106.479] job was a 40 job

[104.64 - 108.799] oops so

[106.479 - 111.119] um i got to cool it off for a week until

[118.719 - 121.19999999999999] unfortunately i didn't document the

[120.079 - 122.63999999999999] whole process because i was kind of

[121.2 - 125.28] multitasking

[122.64 - 127.2] um while while coding this up

[125.28 - 128.64000000000001] but it is available

[165.68 - 170.0] you if you want to spend some of your

[167.44 - 172.07999999999998] hard-earned tokens please feel free to

[170.0 - 174.239] uh to run this

[172.08 - 177.519] okay so here's the repo

[174.239 - 180.159] uh so where i started was download

[177.519 - 181.36] writing prompts so if you go to this

[180.159 - 183.44] subreddit

[181.36 - 186.08] um

[183.44 - 190.07999999999998] r slash writing prompts this is a really

[186.08 - 190.08] great way to get amateur writing

[190.239 - 193.76] oh whoops we don't want it in json

[192.48 - 195.92] format

[193.76 - 196.79999999999998] um

[195.92 - 198.879] so

[196.8 - 200.48000000000002] our slash writing prompts is someone

[198.879 - 201.599] will give you a writing prompt and then

[200.48 - 204.07999999999998] everyone

[201.599 - 206.319] replies with like a short story

[204.08 - 208.4] right and so the top level comment is

[206.319 - 209.67999999999998] pretty much always a short story and

[208.4 - 211.59900000000002] it's written by

[209.68 - 215.36] someone on the internet

[211.599 - 217.35999999999999] so in order to satisfy this idea like

[215.36 - 218.799] rather than use gpd3 to generate

[217.36 - 221.59900000000002] synthetic data i was like let's get real

[218.799 - 223.20000000000002] world data because human mistakes are

[221.599 - 225.11999999999998] going to be very different from gpt3

[223.2 - 226.72] mistakes you can ask gpt3 to make

[225.12 - 228.56] mistakes but it's going to make the same

[226.72 - 230.239] kind of mistakes over and over again

[228.56 - 231.76] whereas if you crowdsource it and you

[230.239 - 233.28] get you know

[231.76 - 234.72] stuff from different people you're going

[233.28 - 236.56] to get different formats different ideas

[234.72 - 240.0] some people respond with poems short

[236.56 - 241.519] stories story fragments um scenes you

[240.0 - 242.959] know whatever you're going to get a lot

[241.519 - 245.84] more variety

[242.959 - 248.239] so what i did was i wrote this script

[245.84 - 250.48] which was just i copy i bashed a bunch

[248.239 - 252.959] to a bunch of other scripts together so

[250.48 - 255.2] all i did was get top posts so i look

[252.959 - 257.28000000000003] for the last month of writing prompts

[255.2 - 259.199] get the top posts

[257.28 - 262.23999999999995] download the top level comments for each

[259.199 - 263.91900000000004] one and i saved that out to a folder

[262.24 - 267.199] called stories

[263.919 - 268.96] and so i've got 388 stories in here of

[267.199 - 270.32] varying lengths the shortest one i think

[268.96 - 272.96] is a poem

[270.32 - 274.24] yep and then the longest one is 10

[272.96 - 276.32] kilobytes

[274.24 - 279.199] um so this is

[276.32 - 280.479] uh 10 000 characters long so that's you

[279.199 - 282.40000000000003] know

[280.479 - 284.88] that's going to be what about 2 000

[282.4 - 287.28] words so that's still flash fiction

[284.88 - 289.44] um okay so i downloaded a whole bunch of

[287.28 - 291.52] stories

[289.44 - 294.0] and then what i did was well first i

[291.52 - 296.71999999999997] needed to um i forgot to exclude bots

[294.0 - 298.24] and short stuff so what i i went and

[296.72 - 299.44000000000005] removed the stuff that we don't want

[298.24 - 300.8] because you don't want to fine tune on

[299.44 - 303.199] bot data

[300.8 - 305.6] um okay so then what i did

[303.199 - 307.52000000000004] was i wrote a prompt so here's what the

[305.6 - 310.24] prompt does and i've started splitting

[307.52 - 311.75899999999996] it out into more granular steps um so

[310.24 - 314.08] the prompt well here let me just show

[311.759 - 315.759] you what the prompt does i can spend

[314.08 - 316.96] some tokens on this so at least you can

[315.759 - 318.8] see

[316.96 - 320.63899999999995] what we're talking about here this

[318.8 - 323.12] prompt does not work on anything other

[320.639 - 325.039] than davinci um curie is not smart

[323.12 - 327.84000000000003] enough to provide feedback

[325.039 - 330.08] um okay so let's go grab

[327.84 - 332.23999999999995] a story let's get one that's about two

[330.08 - 333.52] kilobytes

[332.24 - 335.6] um

[333.52 - 338.56] because that's a good that's a good like

[335.6 - 341.36] bit of flash fiction okay so this prompt

[338.56 - 343.199] says adopt the persona of a professional

[341.36 - 344.639] creative writing editor read the

[343.199 - 346.96000000000004] following story and provide detailed

[344.639 - 349.12] feedback to improve the pros hold the

[346.96 - 350.479] author to the highest literary standards

[349.12 - 352.8] feedback should be open-ended and

[350.479 - 355.12] include examples or suggestions so then

[352.8 - 358.40000000000003] story and then i add a little dmarc and

[355.12 - 359.84000000000003] then um okay oh what got him style

[358.4 - 361.919] end story

[359.84 - 363.75899999999996] provide detailed professional editor

[361.919 - 365.59999999999997] feedback with suggestions and examples

[363.759 - 366.72] to improve pros

[365.6 - 368.16] this

[366.72 - 370.40000000000003] end has gone through several

[368.16 - 372.16] permutations as i tried it because in

[370.4 - 373.35999999999996] some cases it tried to continue the

[372.16 - 375.199] story

[373.36 - 377.6] in other cases it just did all sorts of

[375.199 - 379.91900000000004] random stuff but this this prompt seems

[377.6 - 382.47900000000004] to be pretty consistent so let me show

[379.919 - 386.59999999999997] you what it does and we'll do

[382.479 - 386.59999999999997] the feedback up to 500.

[387.12 - 390.36] let's see

[394.88 - 398.639] okay it says it's clear the author of

[397.44 - 400.0] the story is creative and has a good

[398.639 - 401.36] sense of humor however there are some

[400.0 - 402.96] areas that could use some improvement

[401.36 - 404.88] first the story is very short and feels

[402.96 - 406.31899999999996] incomplete it's possible the author was

[404.88 - 408.15999999999997] going for more concise minimalistic

[406.319 - 410.16] style but in general a more more

[408.16 - 412.0] development a bit more development would

[410.16 - 413.759] be helpful second the story is very

[412.0 - 414.96] light on descriptions readers are given

[413.759 - 416.319] very little information about the

[414.96 - 417.84] characters or setting again this might

[416.319 - 418.88] be a deliberate choice but more

[417.84 - 420.479] description would give the reader a

[418.88 - 422.71999999999997] better sense of the world and

[420.479 - 423.84] that the characters inhabit finally the

[422.72 - 425.12] dialogue could use some work in

[423.84 - 426.56] particular the dialogue between the

[425.12 - 428.319] protagonist and the dancer could be more

[426.56 - 430.319] natural and flowing as it stands it

[428.319 - 431.84000000000003] feels a little bit stilted and awkward

[430.319 - 433.36] overall this is a fun story with a lot

[431.84 - 435.28] of potential with a bit more development

[433.36 - 436.96000000000004] it could be even better

[435.28 - 438.79999999999995] um

[436.96 - 440.4] yeah so

[438.8 - 442.24] and since it's a relatively short story

[440.4 - 444.479] let's read it i had seen them all the

[442.24 - 446.16] simpler ones like bombers or shooters

[444.479 - 448.15999999999997] whose weapons i could absorb with smooth

[446.16 - 450.08000000000004] jazz the scientists who i could convince

[448.16 - 452.16] to lay off their plans by outsmarting

[450.08 - 453.919] them through beethoven bach mozart and

[452.16 - 455.36] the like the crazy teenagers who i

[453.919 - 457.19899999999996] talked off of buildings with lincoln

[455.36 - 459.199] park playing not only in my head but in

[457.199 - 461.44] theirs too in many cases the guy who

[459.199 - 463.28000000000003] poisoned the water of a town allowing me

[461.44 - 464.8] to listen to the band poisoned for a day

[463.28 - 467.11999999999995] that was one of the nicer ones and the

[464.8 - 468.639] more unusual ones the gal who wanted to

[467.12 - 470.16] turn the world into some kind of

[468.639 - 473.36] spaghetti monster forcing me to listen

[470.16 - 475.03900000000004] to we we speak americano on repeat

[473.36 - 476.879] the twins who i fought with nothing but

[475.039 - 479.36] duets in my ears you know fight fire

[476.879 - 481.12] with fire the businessman who wanted to

[479.36 - 483.28000000000003] buy the whole world stopped a series of

[481.12 - 485.52] seminars podcasts and ted talks on

[483.28 - 487.44] finances um that almost bored me to

[485.52 - 489.19899999999996] death i had seen them all in many more

[487.44 - 490.96] nothing could surprise me i thought well

[489.199 - 492.479] i was wrong

[490.96 - 494.0] because while the world's best dancer

[492.479 - 495.919] explains to me their evil plan to make

[494.0 - 497.84] everybody do the twist i realize there

[495.919 - 499.599] is only one way to stop this madness i

[497.84 - 502.0] press play and let the mental image of

[499.599 - 503.52] elevator doors opening uh flood through

[502.0 - 506.879] me and prepare for the ultimate dance

[503.52 - 510.15999999999997] off oppa gangnam style

[506.879 - 511.03900000000004] okay so yes definitely a sense of humor

[510.16 - 512.88] um

[511.039 - 515.5989999999999] the story is short and feels incomplete

[512.88 - 517.519] i agree with that um

[515.599 - 519.519] it it this is kind of a dreamlike

[517.519 - 520.399] sequence and that's okay

[519.519 - 521.839] you know

[520.399 - 523.76] it's possible the author was going for a

[521.839 - 526.08] more concise minimalist style that is a

[523.76 - 527.36] great assessment of the story

[526.08 - 530.08] second the story is very light on

[527.36 - 531.6] description yes

[530.08 - 533.519] this is so this is what's called

[531.6 - 536.0] narrative summary the person is just

[533.519 - 537.519] kind of summarizing you know alluding to

[536.0 - 539.6] things that have happened

[537.519 - 542.32] without providing much detail

[539.6 - 544.32] um but yeah so i would i would agree

[542.32 - 545.7600000000001] give a little bit more description

[544.32 - 547.6800000000001] and that could make the story much

[545.76 - 549.519] richer and more engaging

[547.68 - 551.04] finally the dialogue could use some work

[549.519 - 555.279] um

[551.04 - 557.76] yeah because there really isn't any um

[555.279 - 560.0] but you know having having a little a

[557.76 - 562.16] little pithy rep rt

[560.0 - 564.88] um would be interesting with the final

[562.16 - 566.7199999999999] final encounter uh so yeah i agree with

[564.88 - 568.56] this feedback if this person were to

[566.72 - 570.32] follow this feedback i think it would be

[568.56 - 571.4399999999999] a really interesting and more impactful

[570.32 - 573.0400000000001] story

[571.44 - 574.08] so there you go there's the prompts that

[573.04 - 576.48] i wrote

[574.08 - 580.0] um let's see

[576.48 - 580.88] so prompt generate completions let's go

[580.0 - 582.88] out

[580.88 - 584.64] um all right

[582.88 - 585.8389999999999] so download writing prompts so i

[584.64 - 589.6] downloaded those those are in the

[585.839 - 591.9200000000001] stories um and then i wrote prepare the

[589.6 - 594.08] prompt okay so what i've started doing

[591.92 - 595.68] is rather than kind of build everything

[594.08 - 597.36] all in one shot i break it out into

[595.68 - 598.56] smaller and smaller steps so that we can

[597.36 - 600.24] see it all

[598.56 - 601.8389999999999] so prepare prompts this is a really

[600.24 - 604.399] short script it runs in less than a

[601.839 - 607.519] second and all it does is read all the

[604.399 - 609.519] stories and fi and backfill the prompts

[607.519 - 611.76] and so if you look here the prompts are

[609.519 - 613.12] each of the stories

[611.76 - 614.72] and it just fills in the blanks so that

[613.12 - 616.88] we can check it before it runs just to

[614.72 - 618.399] make sure it looks right

[616.88 - 619.76] and then provide detailed professional

[618.399 - 621.279] feedback with suggestions in the format

[619.76 - 622.88] of a complete paragraph i actually need

[621.279 - 625.4399999999999] to rerun this let me show you how fast

[622.88 - 628.72] it runs because i updated the uh the

[625.44 - 630.5600000000001] prompt python prepare prompts and you

[628.72 - 632.1600000000001] see it runs in less than a second reload

[630.56 - 633.4399999999999] it and all it does is change

[632.16 - 636.88] professional editor feedback with

[633.44 - 637.6800000000001] suggestions example to improve pros

[636.88 - 639.76] so

[637.68 - 642.88] um we've gotten that far prepare the

[639.76 - 644.959] prompts and then um i have another

[642.88 - 648.0] folder called completions so i ran a few

[644.959 - 650.079] of them and you can see what they uh so

[648.0 - 651.44] the completion is here um consider

[650.079 - 653.12] opening a story with a strong image of

[651.44 - 655.2790000000001] abandoned factory town to set the tone

[653.12 - 657.839] the descriptions of the town

[655.279 - 660.8] towns decline could be more concise

[657.839 - 662.0790000000001] there we go a lot of those hard k sounds

[660.8 - 664.3199999999999] the story of rusty joe could be

[662.079 - 665.68] elaborated to make it more engaging

[664.32 - 667.9200000000001] the ending could be stronger and more

[665.68 - 670.4799999999999] unsettling so those those are kind of

[667.92 - 672.16] general feedback um but some of them are

[670.48 - 674.32] still there

[672.16 - 675.92] and so then in order to fully populate

[674.32 - 680.0790000000001] that what we're going to need to do is

[675.92 - 682.16] run the generate completions uh

[680.079 - 684.0] script and so this is this is where the

[682.16 - 685.6] rubber meets the road i'm just have a

[684.0 - 688.399] couple of basic functions for opening

[685.6 - 690.64] and saving i have another function for

[688.399 - 691.839] the gpt3 completions and this will

[690.64 - 693.519] actually need to be switched back to

[691.839 - 695.2] davinci

[693.519 - 697.68] o2 i'm not going to run it because i'm

[695.2 - 698.88] going to run out of quota um so i do

[697.68 - 700.8] apologize

[698.88 - 702.64] um but yeah then all it does is it just

[700.8 - 704.56] loads those prompts

[702.64 - 707.279] runs it through the completion and then

[704.56 - 709.1199999999999] saves it out to a file and that's that

[707.279 - 712.0] after that

[709.12 - 714.9590000000001] all you got to do is run the format json

[712.0 - 717.6] l which it will go through the prompts

[714.959 - 718.959] look for a file and then it will grab

[717.6 - 721.6] that and then

[718.959 - 725.04] pair it with the um

[721.6 - 726.88] with the uh it's commensurate um

[725.04 - 729.1999999999999] completions file because they have the

[726.88 - 731.92] same name um so it's just easy you match

[729.2 - 734.0790000000001] one to one it'll create the json-l and

[731.92 - 737.1999999999999] then there will be a fine-tuned script

[734.079 - 739.12] but again i have spent so much on this

[737.2 - 742.1600000000001] that i am going to have to wait until my

[739.12 - 745.12] quota resets um in a week

[742.16 - 746.399] okay so with all that i do apologize i

[745.12 - 748.639] did want to go ahead and get this out

[746.399 - 750.48] because it was a really cool idea um but

[748.639 - 753.519] if anyone else just takes this and runs

[750.48 - 754.8000000000001] with it please post results um and uh

[753.519 - 756.88] and let me know

[754.8 - 758.24] um otherwise sit tight and we'll come

[756.88 - 760.88] back to this in a week thanks for
