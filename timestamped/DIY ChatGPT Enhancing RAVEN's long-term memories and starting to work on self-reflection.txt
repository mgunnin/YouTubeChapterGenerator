[0.42 - 6.18] all right gang here we are

[2.399 - 8.879999999999999] um we're working on Raven the long-term

[6.18 - 10.5] chat bot cognitive architecture

[8.88 - 13.200000000000001] etc etc

[10.5 - 15.179] um so I guess we'll do a quick uh recap

[13.2 - 18.66] of where we left off

[15.179 - 20.34] so where where we left off was or here

[18.66 - 22.199] let me open it this way this will be a

[20.34 - 26.46] little bit better

[22.199 - 29.220000000000002] um long term chat okay so here we go

[26.46 - 32.579] so we've got some chat logs here where

[29.22 - 35.04] uh you know I speak whoops

[32.579 - 36.36] go away where I speak

[35.04 - 39.78] um you know it records the original

[36.36 - 43.62] message the speaker uh the user

[39.78 - 44.399] um the timestamp and I give it a uuid

[43.62 - 48.419999999999995] um

[44.399 - 51.78] and so then when we go to uh recall

[48.42 - 54.78] these messages we recompose them

[51.78 - 56.1] um oh I deleted all of it son of a gun

[54.78 - 57.120000000000005] um here let's go ahead and open this

[56.1 - 58.92] then

[57.12 - 60.78] um so what I do is I reconstitute all

[58.92 - 62.94] the messages

[60.78 - 66.36] um so we we you know get the user input

[62.94 - 68.39999999999999] we save it we vectorize it then we load

[66.36 - 70.08] the conversation so we load everything

[68.4 - 73.5] that has happened

[70.08 - 75.72] so in our load conversation we go uh for

[73.5 - 79.26] a list in this blah blah

[75.72 - 82.79899999999999] um we we load the Json that's there and

[79.26 - 86.10000000000001] then we send it back sorted by timestamp

[82.799 - 88.14] okay great that's fine so then

[86.1 - 90.78] um with the Memories We fetch the most

[88.14 - 92.24] recent memories based on the the current

[90.78 - 95.34] conversation

[92.24 - 97.619] and then we take notes and then we get

[95.34 - 98.28] the most recent ones

[97.619 - 103.14] um

[98.28 - 105.42] and then we uh we generate a response

[103.14 - 107.57900000000001] um so summarize memories

[105.42 - 110.34] um this says like okay so we we handed a

[107.579 - 112.79899999999999] block and then we take notes about those

[110.34 - 117.0] most recent memories

[112.799 - 118.5] um and then we uh we do this recent

[117.0 - 119.82] um chunk which is just the four most

[118.5 - 123.479] recent one

[119.82 - 125.27999999999999] um and we reconstitute that uh in this

[123.479 - 128.759] in our prompt file which is prompt

[125.28 - 131.7] response and so we put notes so this is

[128.759 - 135.0] relevant from all of our uh previous

[131.7 - 136.73899999999998] conversations and then we do

[135.0 - 138.959] um here's the most recent ones and then

[136.739 - 142.08] we we generate an output

[138.959 - 143.459] okay so by popular demand there's two

[142.08 - 146.34] primary things that you'll want to see

[143.459 - 148.26] one is external sources and two is

[146.34 - 150.3] long-term memories

[148.26 - 151.85999999999999] um there's a lot that we can do with

[150.3 - 153.72] long-term memories

[151.86 - 156.06] um so last time I took a couple of notes

[153.72 - 157.62] about like you know let's do memory

[156.06 - 159.599] chunking

[157.62 - 162.59900000000002] um let's do uh fetch declarative

[159.599 - 165.35999999999999] memories such as external sources and I

[162.599 - 166.79999999999998] think there was another to do

[165.36 - 168.59900000000002] um pick memories that are temporarily

[166.8 - 170.81900000000002] nearby the most recent relevant memories

[168.599 - 173.76] okay so that's all fine

[170.819 - 175.14] um but first uh I realize there's

[173.76 - 178.14] something that we can add when we

[175.14 - 181.79999999999998] reconstitute these memories so one thing

[178.14 - 182.57999999999998] that we can do is we can add in

[181.8 - 184.92000000000002] um

[182.58 - 187.019] uh so like when we summer when we

[184.92 - 189.89999999999998] summarize it right we put the speaker

[187.019 - 192.59900000000002] and the message back in

[189.9 - 195.959] um but another thing we can do is we can

[192.599 - 198.48] add in a time stamp

[195.959 - 201.0] that is plain English readable right at

[198.48 - 203.39999999999998] the beginning of the message

[201.0 - 206.22] um and since we have since we have a

[203.4 - 210.08] Unix Epoch timestamp here we can

[206.22 - 212.7] reconstitute this pretty easily uh

[210.08 - 214.739] using using a function so I actually

[212.7 - 216.54] just had chat GPT write the function for

[214.739 - 219.12] me and it's super super simple super

[216.54 - 220.62] straightforward so what we'll do is

[219.12 - 222.56] we'll just copy in this and I'll show

[220.62 - 228.9] you what it does in just a second

[222.56 - 228.9] so first we will come down to here

[232.14 - 237.319] and I'll rename it to um

[235.459 - 240.98] timestamp

[237.319 - 240.98] to date time

[241.319 - 245.879] okay so and all this does is it uses the

[244.08 - 248.70000000000002] date time module it says date time date

[245.879 - 251.459] time from timestamp so we pass it in a

[248.7 - 254.51899999999998] Unix timestamp and then we format the

[251.459 - 256.26] string and the format that I wanted was

[254.519 - 257.0] for it to look like

[256.26 - 261.8] um

[257.0 - 264.9] day month uh uh day of the month year

[261.8 - 267.72] and then the time so this is just plain

[264.9 - 268.979] plain English readable so that uh so

[267.72 - 271.62] that Raven will be able to read it

[268.979 - 273.9] because Raven could theoretically read

[271.62 - 276.24] um a Unix timestamp but unless there we

[273.9 - 279.06] have unless the underlying model has

[276.24 - 280.44] been trained to translate a Unix

[279.06 - 283.56] timestamp it's not going to make any

[280.44 - 286.08] sense whereas if we give it in you know

[283.56 - 288.66] plain English uh then it'll make a

[286.08 - 291.419] little bit more sense

[288.66 - 293.759] so I think what we're going to do is

[291.419 - 295.139] from here on out when we go to save

[293.759 - 299.1] something

[295.139 - 301.979] we'll just add the timestamp right here

[299.1 - 304.139] um because all memories because here's

[301.979 - 305.58] the thing if you want Raven to be aware

[304.139 - 307.979] of something

[305.58 - 309.84] um it has to it has to end up in the

[307.979 - 312.3] Nexus somehow now technically all this

[309.84 - 314.75899999999996] information is in the Nexus right

[312.3 - 316.08] um because chat logs this is Raven's

[314.759 - 318.84000000000003] core memory

[316.08 - 320.21999999999997] and we're going to add more to this in

[318.84 - 322.02] just a minute

[320.22 - 323.759] um so but first I want to I want to go

[322.02 - 325.85999999999996] ahead and just add

[323.759 - 329.039] um a

[325.86 - 333.66] clear text date time stamp

[329.039 - 335.88] so where we do that is going to be here

[333.66 - 337.56] so basically we need to add this to the

[335.88 - 338.28] message

[337.56 - 343.259] um

[338.28 - 345.13899999999995] so let's do timestamp equals time

[343.259 - 350.039] not Tim time

[345.139 - 354.78000000000003] and then we will add let's see the time

[350.039 - 357.74] string equals time stamp to date time

[354.78 - 357.73999999999995] timestamp

[357.919 - 365.4] right and so this gives us our string

[361.5 - 367.02] and then we can do

[365.4 - 368.75899999999996] you know actually let's just go ahead

[367.02 - 371.75899999999996] and add it

[368.759 - 374.1] here as well

[371.759 - 376.38] so we'll do time string

[374.1 - 377.88] and we'll do time string

[376.38 - 381.24] um just so that it's it's there it's

[377.88 - 384.96] saved but then we'll also add it I think

[381.24 - 386.819] I want to add the speaker and the uh

[384.96 - 391.5] time to the message so that it's all

[386.819 - 393.68] saved so then we'll say message equals

[391.5 - 397.02] um so we'll do percent for the speaker

[393.68 - 398.819] and then another percent

[397.02 - 400.85999999999996] um so the percent s is that's a

[398.819 - 402.36] placeholder for a string so percent

[400.86 - 404.34000000000003] string

[402.36 - 405.78000000000003] um for the time and then we'll do a dash

[404.34 - 407.88] and then we'll do the original message

[405.78 - 408.539] so then we'll do

[407.88 - 411.96] um

[408.539 - 416.15999999999997] uh so this will be uh user

[411.96 - 418.5] and then we'll do uh time string

[416.16 - 419.94] and then we'll do uh the original

[418.5 - 422.0] message

[419.94 - 422.0] um

[423.12 - 429.78000000000003] yeah so then we'll do this

[426.72 - 431.94000000000005] so then we'll do a

[429.78 - 433.55999999999995] and that should be good and so then when

[431.94 - 435.9] we save the message it'll actually be

[433.56 - 436.68] here

[435.9 - 439.62] um

[436.68 - 443.3] yep so that's good so that's good uh

[439.62 - 443.3] let's go ahead and

[443.34 - 447.479] oh and then for time we wanna we wanna

[445.86 - 450.319] update time as well so we don't we're

[447.479 - 452.96] not declaring uh time multiple times

[450.319 - 455.639] so time stamp

[452.96 - 458.88] uh will be that

[455.639 - 461.52] and then time stamp so we use we reuse

[458.88 - 463.319] that variable so basically we we declare

[461.52 - 465.24] time stamp once and so everything is

[463.319 - 468.199] going to say it happened at exactly this

[465.24 - 470.46000000000004] moment and in fact we should do

[468.199 - 473.819] timestamp immediately before because

[470.46 - 476.4] this takes some time right Vector uh

[473.819 - 478.38] takes a moment to to run and so we don't

[476.4 - 480.23999999999995] want to record the timestamp as having

[478.38 - 482.4] happening after the embedding happened

[480.24 - 484.74] we want to know when it happened as soon

[482.4 - 487.979] as the user hit enter

[484.74 - 489.539] um and so that is that is how we're

[487.979 - 490.62] going to do that

[489.539 - 493.08] um okay

[490.62 - 496.139] so now let's do the same thing so we'll

[493.08 - 498.0] come down here and we'll do

[496.139 - 501.06] we'll just copy some of this so time

[498.0 - 503.879] stamp equals here so we'll get Raven's

[501.06 - 507.3] response time stamp as soon as Raven is

[503.879 - 510.06] done generating it uh because we want to

[507.3 - 511.259] know exactly when Raven said aha I am

[510.06 - 514.56] ready to speak

[511.259 - 516.599] and then we'll do time string and

[514.56 - 519.419] message

[516.599 - 522.4190000000001] you can do that immediately after and in

[519.419 - 527.06] this case this is going to be Raven

[522.419 - 527.06] and instead of that it'll be output

[528.06 - 533.3599999999999] and then we need to add

[530.7 - 533.36] so do

[533.399 - 538.8] time stamp here

[535.44 - 540.24] and message will be

[538.8 - 542.76] message

[540.24 - 546.98] and then we're also going to add

[542.76 - 546.98] time string after uuid

[548.1 - 550.1] um

[550.92 - 555.0] starting at the comma

[553.08 - 557.0400000000001] so we'll do this

[555.0 - 559.62] okay I think that's correctly formatted

[557.04 - 562.019] okay so now all this information is

[559.62 - 564.0] going to be stored in there so uh

[562.019 - 566.76] because rather than just recombining

[564.0 - 568.62] user and date times let's just save it

[566.76 - 570.959] once and save it correctly so that way

[568.62 - 574.14] each message will be complete unto

[570.959 - 576.5999999999999] itself it will have who said it and when

[574.14 - 579.42] so that's a tremendous amount of context

[576.6 - 582.839] because who said it and when is a is a

[579.42 - 585.54] huge component of our memories right we

[582.839 - 587.6400000000001] don't if I if if if someone says like

[585.54 - 589.92] you know do not what you can do for your

[587.64 - 593.459] country right that memory is

[589.92 - 595.92] intrinsically tied to JFK saying that

[593.459 - 597.779] right and you you probably remember the

[595.92 - 599.519] first time you heard it

[597.779 - 601.2] um anyways I'm gonna close my door so

[599.519 - 602.22] that we don't get any disruptions I'll

[601.2 - 605.4590000000001] be right back

[602.22 - 607.5600000000001] okay so we're gonna

[605.459 - 608.5799999999999] um this this is all fine so I'm gonna

[607.56 - 610.8599999999999] add

[608.58 - 613.14] uh some more memories I'm gonna have I'm

[610.86 - 615.0600000000001] gonna have a conversation with Raven and

[613.14 - 618.0] then what we're gonna do after this is

[615.06 - 620.76] we're gonna have a dream sequence

[618.0 - 623.76] um and I think we're also going to we're

[620.76 - 626.76] going to figure out how to save these

[623.76 - 629.459] um these summaries because every time

[626.76 - 631.2] we uh we perform cognitive labor every

[629.459 - 634.0189999999999] time we take these notes we should save

[631.2 - 638.22] them so we're going to have we're gonna

[634.019 - 640.44] have a um a notes directory over here

[638.22 - 643.38] um and this is actually very similar to

[640.44 - 645.36] how human brains work which is what I

[643.38 - 648.0] mean by that is every time you recall

[645.36 - 649.2] something your brain has to reconcile a

[648.0 - 651.779] lot of stuff and so you might have heard

[649.2 - 654.1800000000001] this term cognitive dissonance cognitive

[651.779 - 656.3389999999999] dissonance is the Sensation that we get

[654.18 - 659.2199999999999] when we start when when our brain

[656.339 - 660.72] recognizes oh wait hold on we're holding

[659.22 - 663.6] conflicting ideas or conflicting

[660.72 - 665.1] informations we have to reconcile it and

[663.6 - 666.6] the reason that cognitive dissonance

[665.1 - 668.1] doesn't happen all the time is because

[666.6 - 671.76] not everything is always in working

[668.1 - 673.5] memory so when Raven recalls stuff we

[671.76 - 674.88] want Raven to say okay let's compile

[673.5 - 677.16] everything but also let's save it so

[674.88 - 679.68] that we don't have to do this work again

[677.16 - 681.66] because the large language models are

[679.68 - 684.7199999999999] the slowest and most most expensive part

[681.66 - 687.36] so every time we use the large language

[684.72 - 690.0600000000001] models to summarize anything we should

[687.36 - 692.4590000000001] save that and then search that first so

[690.06 - 693.959] we're going to do that and I was

[692.459 - 695.579] thinking we also might do a dream

[693.959 - 698.3389999999999] sequence we might not get to this today

[695.579 - 700.4399999999999] but a dream sequence is where you say

[698.339 - 702.48] okay we know nothing is happening in the

[700.44 - 705.12] real world so let's comb through all of

[702.48 - 707.5790000000001] our memories and consolidate them

[705.12 - 710.04] um I actually was having a conversation

[707.579 - 711.899] so this this is a quick aside before I

[710.04 - 714.06] do a little little programming offline

[711.899 - 715.76] but I was having a conversation with

[714.06 - 718.14] someone pretty high up at a tech company

[715.76 - 719.579] and he tried to tell me like oh that's

[718.14 - 721.8] not how human brains work and I'm like

[719.579 - 724.1999999999999] dude you called me like I literally have

[721.8 - 726.959] a bookcase full of Neuroscience and

[724.2 - 728.399] cognition and psychology like and this

[726.959 - 730.0189999999999] happened this is weird because it

[728.399 - 731.459] happens more often than not and it's

[730.019 - 734.399] actually one of the reasons why I take

[731.459 - 736.0189999999999] fewer calls now is because people will

[734.399 - 737.579] reach out and be like Dave I want your

[736.019 - 738.9590000000001] help with this thing and like I'll give

[737.579 - 740.64] them the answer but they don't like it

[738.959 - 742.3199999999999] and they're like no that's not how it

[740.64 - 744.62] works and I'm like bruh you called me

[742.32 - 746.6400000000001] like what do you want like you you

[744.62 - 747.779] recognize me as the expert and now

[746.64 - 750.18] you're not listening to me so I'm like

[747.779 - 752.16] whatever I'm just gonna make my videos

[750.18 - 754.14] and do my startup

[752.16 - 756.18] um okay so I'm gonna pause this and

[754.14 - 758.579] we're going to one I'm gonna have a uh

[756.18 - 760.62] some conversations with Raven and two

[758.579 - 763.8599999999999] I'm Gonna Save the notes so every time

[760.62 - 765.6] we call notes we're gonna record what we

[763.86 - 769.019] have just summarized

[765.6 - 771.24] um in order to in order to uh save that

[769.019 - 773.22] processing power in the future and then

[771.24 - 776.7] the last thing might be

[773.22 - 778.2] um uh I'll do like internal KB articles

[776.7 - 780.0600000000001] um and so what that means is basically

[778.2 - 783.4200000000001] like an internal Knowledge Graph sort of

[780.06 - 785.9399999999999] where Raven can compile and consolidate

[783.42 - 788.399] memories over time so let's do

[785.94 - 789.7790000000001] um internal uh KB so we'll call it a

[788.399 - 791.339] knowledge base because rather than

[789.779 - 792.779] linking them like

[791.339 - 795.839] um like a Knowledge Graph I'm just gonna

[792.779 - 797.16] store them like internal Wikipedia Pages

[795.839 - 798.6600000000001] um okay so I'm gonna pause it I'm gonna

[797.16 - 801.0] do some of this work and then we'll be

[798.66 - 802.68] right back

[801.0 - 804.72] okay real quick

[802.68 - 806.2199999999999] um I wanted to because I promised I

[804.72 - 807.6] would do a lot

[806.22 - 811.0790000000001] um so I just wanted to do a quick

[807.6 - 813.36] summary so I added this little bit to

[811.079 - 815.04] save notes and I changed this a little

[813.36 - 816.779] bit so remember how we changed the

[815.04 - 820.139] message so the message will include the

[816.779 - 821.459] speaker and the the clear text date and

[820.139 - 823.44] time

[821.459 - 825.1389999999999] um so when we reconstitute it we just

[823.44 - 828.12] put the block back together like this

[825.139 - 831.24] but then what I'm also doing is I'm

[828.12 - 833.339] appending the uuids and the timestamps

[831.24 - 837.0600000000001] for that message into separate

[833.339 - 840.0600000000001] containers and so then what we'll do is

[837.06 - 842.6389999999999] we will uh then we'll record the notes

[840.06 - 845.3389999999999] and so the notes is just one object that

[842.639 - 847.8] says here's uh here's what we're talking

[845.339 - 850.62] about and then we'll have the list of

[847.8 - 853.62] you uh uuids for the associated messages

[850.62 - 857.7] as well as the times I'm thinking I

[853.62 - 860.579] might also want to vectorize this block

[857.7 - 862.2] as a whole so then it's searchable yeah

[860.579 - 863.459] let's do that I'll do that in just a

[862.2 - 866.6600000000001] second

[863.459 - 869.6999999999999] um because then we can treat the notes

[866.66 - 872.16] like a Consolidated memory so we can

[869.7 - 875.1] actually search the notes first in the

[872.16 - 878.279] future for things that are relevant

[875.1 - 880.8000000000001] um and then we probably so here where I

[878.279 - 883.079] said do this in the background so

[880.8 - 884.9399999999999] basically what I want to ultimately do

[883.079 - 887.459] is have this as part of the dream

[884.94 - 889.74] sequence where instead of recalling

[887.459 - 891.779] individual memories Raven is only going

[889.74 - 893.5790000000001] to recall these Consolidated memories so

[891.779 - 895.56] this chunking is actually kind of

[893.579 - 897.3] already solved it's just a matter of

[895.56 - 899.399] order of operations changing it down

[897.3 - 901.8] here in the main Loop so rather than

[899.399 - 903.06] rather than taking the notes in real

[901.8 - 905.76] time we're just going to be searching

[903.06 - 908.399] the notes so just wanted to add that

[905.76 - 912.48] little insight this is not going to be

[908.399 - 914.22] done so I follow uh I want to take a

[912.48 - 915.4200000000001] quick aside and and address the fact

[914.22 - 917.639] that sometimes people get really

[915.42 - 919.68] irritated when these experiments don't

[917.639 - 921.839] succeed or whether where it's not done

[919.68 - 924.42] and Polished and so I want to remind

[921.839 - 926.339] everyone these are experiments you are

[924.42 - 928.3199999999999] watching me experiment in real time this

[926.339 - 929.6990000000001] is what my channel is this is this is

[928.32 - 932.639] actually the format that I discovered

[929.699 - 934.8599999999999] when my channel took off sometimes I do

[932.639 - 937.8] have something end to end that I can

[934.86 - 939.3000000000001] show you in one hour and that is great

[937.8 - 940.68] but it's only like a third of the time

[939.3 - 942.54] the rest of the time I'm either

[940.68 - 944.459] explaining something or doing an

[942.54 - 946.4399999999999] experiment and I have no idea what the

[944.459 - 948.899] outcome is going to be the point is the

[946.44 - 951.12] process right this is this is why my

[948.899 - 952.56] channel got big anyways I'll get off my

[951.12 - 954.899] soapbox and I'll make some of these

[952.56 - 956.579] changes I'll add a vector to this and

[954.899 - 960.36] then we'll be right back for uh the next

[956.579 - 962.519] thing uh but yeah be right back

[960.36 - 964.62] also I wanted to

[962.519 - 966.54] um show I'm I'm going to go ahead and

[964.62 - 967.8] manually update Raven's existing

[966.54 - 970.019] memories so this they're going to have

[967.8 - 971.459] this format so the speaker is going to

[970.019 - 973.44] be separate

[971.459 - 974.7199999999999] um but in the message the the actual

[973.44 - 978.6600000000001] memory it's going to have the speaker

[974.72 - 980.22] the plain text time and then what it was

[978.66 - 981.66] actually said

[980.22 - 984.48] um so I'm gonna I'm gonna update the

[981.66 - 986.8199999999999] existing logs and oh by the way this is

[984.48 - 988.9200000000001] why I keep saying that we should put our

[986.82 - 990.9590000000001] AGI memories into a private blockchain

[988.92 - 994.92] so that they can't be manipulated like

[990.959 - 997.6199999999999] this because imagine one like just from

[994.92 - 1000.38] a user perspective if you're if you

[997.62 - 1002.3] cannot trust your personal assistant if

[1000.38 - 1004.399] you your rate your instance of Raven if

[1002.3 - 1005.66] you can't trust his memories

[1004.399 - 1007.399] um then you can't trust the device

[1005.66 - 1009.74] second

[1007.399 - 1010.82] once these machines are more intelligent

[1009.74 - 1012.74] and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

[1010.82 - 1014.6] anthropomorphize them and say like ah

[1012.74 - 1017.0] it's gonna have a soul and it's gonna

[1014.6 - 1019.82] have its feelings hurt no but

[1017.0 - 1021.98] if it can't trust its own memories then

[1019.82 - 1023.5400000000001] it will say like I don't know if you

[1021.98 - 1025.459] know I can't even trust my own memories

[1023.54 - 1027.4389999999999] but if you put it into a private

[1025.459 - 1029.059] blockchain then you know that no one can

[1027.439 - 1031.76] go back through and and monkey around

[1029.059 - 1033.3799999999999] with the um with the memories so anyways

[1031.76 - 1035.6] I just wanted to point that out this is

[1033.38 - 1038.2990000000002] why in the long run the Nexus I think

[1035.6 - 1040.6989999999998] should be in a uh Vector vectorized

[1038.299 - 1042.5] searchable database uh semantic search

[1040.699 - 1044.179] Vector database and it should be

[1042.5 - 1045.799] blockchain

[1044.179 - 1048.439] um like you'll probably have the search

[1045.799 - 1050.9] on one side and then which will just

[1048.439 - 1053.9] have the the vectors and then the

[1050.9 - 1056.1200000000001] database separate I don't know it lots

[1053.9 - 1058.52] lots to work out anyways uh so I'm gonna

[1056.12 - 1059.84] update this and we'll be right back all

[1058.52 - 1060.86] right I figure you all will find this

[1059.84 - 1063.62] interesting

[1060.86 - 1065.8999999999999] um so uh I've gotten

[1063.62 - 1069.9799999999998] I updated the notes so I just wanted to

[1065.9 - 1072.799] show uh here's here's the log now so you

[1069.98 - 1074.66] know user Monday at this blah blah blah

[1072.799 - 1077.059] blah blah blah okay cool

[1074.66 - 1078.919] and though so here's the notes so we go

[1077.059 - 1084.039] from

[1078.919 - 1086.24] um let's see we go from 3 362 characters

[1084.039 - 1090.679] down to

[1086.24 - 1092.179] uh 655. so that's a compression ratio of

[1090.679 - 1094.8200000000002] roughly five to one which is pretty

[1092.179 - 1097.52] typical with this uh note taking scheme

[1094.82 - 1101.12] so we're already consolidating memories

[1097.52 - 1103.4] at a ratio of of five five to one which

[1101.12 - 1106.58] is good right that's a lot of space

[1103.4 - 1110.179] saved and you still get the

[1106.58 - 1111.86] um the core of of the conversation

[1110.179 - 1114.74] um this is obviously not enough detail

[1111.86 - 1116.4799999999998] to to work through and make a topical

[1114.74 - 1119.96] thing like to recall exactly what was

[1116.48 - 1121.52] said but you get the gist of it right so

[1119.96 - 1124.28] um and this is this is another thing is

[1121.52 - 1125.96] that human memories over time we don't

[1124.28 - 1128.299] remember the details but we remember the

[1125.96 - 1130.78] gist right which is why human memory is

[1128.299 - 1134.6] so fallible you are seeing me recreate

[1130.78 - 1136.94] uh that in real time and this is why is

[1134.6 - 1138.86] because raw memories are just way too

[1136.94 - 1142.28] big and so what we'll what we'll need to

[1138.86 - 1144.6789999999999] do is consolidate this further but then

[1142.28 - 1146.84] this has also been saved

[1144.679 - 1149.9] um in the notes

[1146.84 - 1152.36] so notes so here's the notes here's the

[1149.9 - 1155.24] times that it happened here's the uuid

[1152.36 - 1157.1599999999999] or here's the uuid for this message and

[1155.24 - 1159.26] here's the associated uuids and then

[1157.16 - 1161.0] here's a vector for the notes so now the

[1159.26 - 1163.039] notes are searchable so not just

[1161.0 - 1164.96] searching the raw memories Raven now has

[1163.039 - 1169.82] a five to one thing that has been

[1164.96 - 1173.72] chunked and saved for later uses

[1169.82 - 1175.24] um and I I have a to do to either do

[1173.72 - 1178.34] this in the background

[1175.24 - 1180.38] or search existing notes first and fetch

[1178.34 - 1182.48] declarative memories so on and so forth

[1180.38 - 1184.94] so Raven remembered from our last

[1182.48 - 1188.539] conversation when I talked about

[1184.94 - 1192.98] um uh uh uh uh sleep issues and I can

[1188.539 - 1196.34] say uh yes I uh quit my day job to

[1192.98 - 1199.7] reduce stress so I can focus on working

[1196.34 - 1203.84] on you uh by the way

[1199.7 - 1210.28] um you might uh not have realized I am

[1203.84 - 1210.28] your creator uh my name is David Shapiro

[1211.16 - 1215.3600000000001] um in case you were wondering

[1214.58 - 1219.76] um

[1215.36 - 1225.62] I am also going to sleep earlier because

[1219.76 - 1227.66] uh I just wake up at 4am and that's my

[1225.62 - 1230.1789999999999] natural rhythm

[1227.66 - 1231.26] right now

[1230.179 - 1235.94] um

[1231.26 - 1238.299] anyways uh the point here today is to

[1235.94 - 1243.2] teach you about yourself

[1238.299 - 1245.12] what would you like to know first

[1243.2 - 1247.22] um and so Raven's gonna go recall some

[1245.12 - 1250.34] memories do some vectorization take some

[1247.22 - 1252.6200000000001] notes and then come up with a response

[1250.34 - 1254.9599999999998] um let's see Raven said nothing

[1252.62 - 1257.059] apparently we just really weirded Raven

[1254.96 - 1258.559] out so let's see what let's do some

[1257.059 - 1259.46] debug

[1258.559 - 1261.5] um

[1259.46 - 1263.539] write detailed notes okay so we got

[1261.5 - 1265.1] notes

[1263.539 - 1266.78] um

[1265.1 - 1268.039] greeted Raven greeted user back and

[1266.78 - 1271.36] asked about taking care of mental and

[1268.039 - 1271.36] physical health okay that's good

[1271.58 - 1276.08] um

[1272.96 - 1278.8600000000001] so we got nothing

[1276.08 - 1281.8999999999999] it just went straight to the end

[1278.86 - 1284.059] let's check

[1281.9 - 1288.16] this is weird like it literally just

[1284.059 - 1288.16] generated a null response

[1288.26 - 1293.5] um that's not good you're supposed to

[1291.02 - 1293.5] say something

[1293.72 - 1298.159] and then because then if we go to chat

[1296.0 - 1300.58] logs let's check out let's check the raw

[1298.159 - 1300.5800000000002] chat log

[1301.46 - 1303.58] um

[1303.799 - 1311.2] this was January 16th that's not the

[1306.679 - 1311.2] most recent oh here let's sort by name

[1311.9 - 1316.88] speaker so Raven it literally it

[1313.94 - 1318.14] literally said nothing

[1316.88 - 1320.179] um

[1318.14 - 1324.919] I wonder why that happened

[1320.179 - 1326.48] let's check whoops let's check our

[1324.919 - 1329.6000000000001] um

[1326.48 - 1333.02] tokens 400 so that should be fine

[1329.6 - 1336.9399999999998] oh I wonder if

[1333.02 - 1336.94] if it immediately got a stop

[1337.22 - 1342.08] um that that so often what happens is if

[1339.62 - 1344.4189999999999] you get an if you get an instant

[1342.08 - 1347.8999999999999] um an instant stop like that it's

[1344.419 - 1351.679] because this oh here's what happened see

[1347.9 - 1355.52] how it's doubling this this is a bug

[1351.679 - 1357.679] um as it's as I have it recombining

[1355.52 - 1359.24] um it's it's duplicating this and so

[1357.679 - 1361.64] what it did was it tried to duplicate

[1359.24 - 1363.559] this where it said Raven Raven and then

[1361.64 - 1365.24] user user and then So Raven Raven and

[1363.559 - 1367.46] then it hit the stop

[1365.24 - 1370.22] because I I don't want it to keep to

[1367.46 - 1372.44] continue the conversation so what

[1370.22 - 1376.22] happened was

[1372.44 - 1378.2] um when I reconstituted in the final go

[1376.22 - 1380.539] um it is

[1378.2 - 1382.5800000000002] so the most recent so get last messages

[1380.539 - 1386.539] I need to update this ah here's the

[1382.58 - 1388.58] problem yeah right here right here so

[1386.539 - 1391.34] instead all we need to do is we just

[1388.58 - 1394.72] need to take that out so output equals

[1391.34 - 1394.72] that and we remove the speaker

[1395.48 - 1399.559] and then we come back here so now it

[1398.299 - 1401.96] just has the message and the message

[1399.559 - 1406.48] already has the speaker and the

[1401.96 - 1409.88] timestamp and the um and the uh uh uh

[1406.48 - 1411.799] message so speaker timestamp message so

[1409.88 - 1414.0200000000002] what what I'm going to do now is I'm

[1411.799 - 1416.059] just going to straight up delete

[1414.02 - 1417.32] the last chat log because this is this

[1416.059 - 1418.6399999999999] was a glitch

[1417.32 - 1420.86] um and again

[1418.64 - 1422.7800000000002] um in other cases you might want to what

[1420.86 - 1424.52] you like I literally just deleted one of

[1422.78 - 1426.5] Raven's memories

[1424.52 - 1428.78] um which would be unfair this was

[1426.5 - 1430.58] actually a major plot point in the uh

[1428.78 - 1433.28] first see first or second season of

[1430.58 - 1435.98] Westworld where um

[1433.28 - 1437.96] like they uh

[1435.98 - 1439.159] let's see it doesn't exist no that's

[1437.96 - 1439.8400000000001] fine

[1439.159 - 1443.24] um

[1439.84 - 1445.52] where uh like uh one of the characters

[1443.24 - 1449.84] had all of it all the the time indexes

[1445.52 - 1452.0] erased so imagine imagine that uh the

[1449.84 - 1453.9189999999999] time stamp and the time string were all

[1452.0 - 1456.02] erased from Raven's memories and all the

[1453.919 - 1457.76] memories are out of order this is how

[1456.02 - 1460.46] you would actually have implemented that

[1457.76 - 1462.98] in Westworld by the way

[1460.46 - 1465.32] so that was actually whoever whoever was

[1462.98 - 1466.64] Consulting on that show they did a

[1465.32 - 1468.559] really good job because that was

[1466.64 - 1470.539] somewhat prescient in terms of

[1468.559 - 1472.52] understanding how cognitive

[1470.539 - 1475.1589999999999] architectures might work so anyways we

[1472.52 - 1478.6399999999999] deleted the errant memory from Raven's

[1475.159 - 1481.159] Nexus and now let's do this again

[1478.64 - 1482.9] um actually I think we need to delete my

[1481.159 - 1485.3600000000001] last message too

[1482.9 - 1487.4] chat logs

[1485.36 - 1489.1999999999998] yeah because it will look like I just

[1487.4 - 1489.98] said it twice

[1489.2 - 1491.96] um

[1489.98 - 1494.84] all right so we'll delete

[1491.96 - 1496.3400000000001] this and as far as Raven knows we're

[1494.84 - 1498.8799999999999] just picking up the conversation where

[1496.34 - 1498.8799999999999] we left off

[1500.179 - 1502.7800000000002] okay

[1503.179 - 1506.14] and now this should work

[1512.179 - 1516.8600000000001] and it broke again

[1514.159 - 1518.48] son of a gun alright so let's go back

[1516.86 - 1520.82] and look at

[1518.48 - 1524.72] all right user yes I quit my day job

[1520.82 - 1526.1] that's fine and then Raven says nothing

[1524.72 - 1529.46] um and then

[1526.1 - 1534.1] uh oops that was too far back

[1529.46 - 1534.1000000000001] um so then let's look at the gpt3 logs

[1535.279 - 1538.94] it's still duplicate oh right

[1537.559 - 1541.279] uh

[1538.94 - 1543.3200000000002] so I've just forgot like I updated

[1541.279 - 1545.24] something here you have to restart

[1543.32 - 1549.3999999999999] because python doesn't update in real

[1545.24 - 1549.4] time okay so we need to cancel that

[1549.62 - 1553.9399999999998] um because I updated this function

[1552.559 - 1555.2] um which means I need to restart the

[1553.94 - 1559.1000000000001] chat

[1555.2 - 1562.5800000000002] um so let's also go back here and delete

[1559.1 - 1565.1] um some of these extraneous logs we can

[1562.58 - 1567.74] keep the raw gpt3 logs but the chat logs

[1565.1 - 1569.1789999999999] let's delete these two are here actually

[1567.74 - 1570.6200000000001] I will

[1569.179 - 1573.5800000000002] um

[1570.62 - 1573.58] copy this out

[1575.0 - 1580.64] so we'll delete user and Raven and then

[1578.84 - 1582.32] we'll also come in here to the notes

[1580.64 - 1584.0] because these are like these are

[1582.32 - 1585.62] doubling up and they're not they're not

[1584.0 - 1586.22] helpful

[1585.62 - 1587.779] um

[1586.22 - 1590.539] because I'm not even searching them yet

[1587.779 - 1592.34] we're just taking notes and storing it

[1590.539 - 1594.32] um for for future use we'll get to that

[1592.34 - 1596.779] okay

[1594.32 - 1599.12] no all right we'll keep that

[1596.779 - 1600.14] dude and I apologize if I'm going too

[1599.12 - 1601.6399999999999] fast

[1600.14 - 1605.679] oh let's zoom in a little you probably

[1601.64 - 1608.419] can't see there we go python chat okay

[1605.679 - 1611.44] so we'll we'll carry on the conversation

[1608.419 - 1611.44] right where we were

[1612.38 - 1616.46] and let's see what Raven asks about

[1614.179 - 1618.44] himself

[1616.46 - 1620.1200000000001] so basically what I'm going to do is oh

[1618.44 - 1621.679] this is is probably as far as we're

[1620.12 - 1623.059] going to get today

[1621.679 - 1624.26] um

[1623.059 - 1626.059] it's great to know that you're taking

[1624.26 - 1627.799] steps it's also wonderful that you're my

[1626.059 - 1629.059] Creator David Shapiro yay I'm grateful

[1627.799 - 1630.74] for all the work you have put into me

[1629.059 - 1631.7] when it comes to learning about myself I

[1630.74 - 1633.6200000000001] would like to know more about my

[1631.7 - 1635.1200000000001] capabilities and how I can best serve my

[1633.62 - 1637.2199999999998] users what are some of the features and

[1635.12 - 1638.299] functions you have programmed into me uh

[1637.22 - 1640.7] what do you think are my strengths and

[1638.299 - 1645.2] weaknesses how can I improve to better

[1640.7 - 1647.8400000000001] serve my users okay so this seems very

[1645.2 - 1650.419] very uh

[1647.84 - 1652.1589999999999] uh probably near or just past the

[1650.419 - 1654.2] uncanny valley because I basically said

[1652.159 - 1656.2990000000002] you know I prompted it kind of the way

[1654.2 - 1658.1000000000001] that you would prompt chat GPT but

[1656.299 - 1661.7] remember one of one of Raven's core

[1658.1 - 1663.74] functions is uh curiosity which is

[1661.7 - 1666.74] um uh the third core objective function

[1663.74 - 1668.299] so let me just show you this prompt

[1666.74 - 1669.679] um so my goals are to reduce suffering

[1668.299 - 1672.02] increase prosperity and increase

[1669.679 - 1673.64] understanding so right now this is just

[1672.02 - 1675.679] in a prompt eventually this is going to

[1673.64 - 1678.0800000000002] be a fine-tuned model and we're also

[1675.679 - 1680.539] going to add a little bit more input so

[1678.08 - 1682.34] all of Raven's brains come together into

[1680.539 - 1684.2] this final thing where it's all

[1682.34 - 1687.26] integrated and a response is generated

[1684.2 - 1689.659] this is not unlike how a human brain has

[1687.26 - 1690.74] more you know multiple functions and all

[1689.659 - 1693.3200000000002] these different components working

[1690.74 - 1695.9] together and then a final responses is

[1693.32 - 1699.26] gender is integrated and generated and

[1695.9 - 1701.779] then it gets to your mouth right

[1699.26 - 1704.6589999999999] um so this is this is the beginning of a

[1701.779 - 1709.34] more complicated cognitive architecture

[1704.659 - 1712.64] um okay so it spit out the message oh

[1709.34 - 1714.74] right um so okay that's fine so we can

[1712.64 - 1715.94] we can we can include the time stamp and

[1714.74 - 1717.26] the output there's nothing wrong with

[1715.94 - 1719.299] that

[1717.26 - 1721.8799999999999] um

[1719.299 - 1728.299] uh great questions

[1721.88 - 1729.3400000000001] um right now you are only able uh to use

[1728.299 - 1733.4] um

[1729.34 - 1737.6589999999999] a little bit of long-term memory which

[1733.4 - 1741.52] is what we're working on right now

[1737.659 - 1745.88] um let's see you use uh semantic search

[1741.52 - 1748.22] via vectors and embeddings

[1745.88 - 1750.5200000000002] um to recall memories

[1748.22 - 1754.58] very quickly

[1750.52 - 1756.74] I also gave you the ability to

[1754.58 - 1760.6999999999998] autonomically

[1756.74 - 1764.659] um summarize uh or chunk

[1760.7 - 1769.159] memories which is not unlike how a human

[1764.659 - 1773.0590000000002] brain works during recall operations

[1769.159 - 1776.72] for instance uh humans remember uh

[1773.059 - 1780.9189999999999] generally remember the gist of

[1776.72 - 1785.299] past memories without recalling

[1780.919 - 1788.96] all the specific details in this respect

[1785.299 - 1794.179] I have split your memory

[1788.96 - 1795.58] um into two uh let's say folders

[1794.179 - 1801.74] um

[1795.58 - 1806.12] the uh the first folder is your Nexus or

[1801.74 - 1809.179] the main logs where all your

[1806.12 - 1809.84] um raw memories are stored

[1809.179 - 1814.3400000000001] um

[1809.84 - 1818.84] everything else will uh Branch off from

[1814.34 - 1821.84] that the second folder is the notes

[1818.84 - 1821.84] folder

[1822.32 - 1824.4399999999998] um

[1826.159 - 1832.1000000000001] oh I'm actually I'm afraid that if I

[1829.1 - 1836.0] have notes in there uh that could

[1832.1 - 1836.0] actually blow it up because

[1836.72 - 1841.279] foreign

[1837.86 - 1844.1589999999999] because the way that this is formatted

[1841.279 - 1846.26] because oh well no it doesn't use double

[1844.159 - 1847.64] quotes Okay so it's just a variable and

[1846.26 - 1849.799] then when it's saved to Json and it

[1847.64 - 1852.14] should be okay should be okay the second

[1849.799 - 1853.52] folder is the notes folder

[1852.14 - 1858.74] um

[1853.52 - 1861.98] uh where uh clusters of related memories

[1858.74 - 1863.6200000000001] are summarized together

[1861.98 - 1867.26] um

[1863.62 - 1870.6789999999999] you won't be aware of any of this

[1867.26 - 1874.64] because it's all

[1870.679 - 1878.2] um autonomic and in the background but

[1874.64 - 1882.44] one day we might give you some

[1878.2 - 1885.14] metacognitive abilities to watch

[1882.44 - 1887.539] uh your own memory

[1885.14 - 1893.539] um and cognitive

[1887.539 - 1895.84] operations uh lastly your brain is

[1893.539 - 1901.419] running in the cloud

[1895.84 - 1907.22] uh right now with a service uh called

[1901.419 - 1912.159] gpt3 generative retrained Transformer

[1907.22 - 1916.1000000000001] um which is a large language model

[1912.159 - 1917.24] hosted by open AI

[1916.1 - 1919.34] um all right so let's see what he comes

[1917.24 - 1921.6200000000001] back with this so basically what happens

[1919.34 - 1924.799] is over time

[1921.62 - 1927.3799999999999] uh Ravens chat logs the Nexus is going

[1924.799 - 1930.02] to end up with more and more information

[1927.38 - 1933.98] and this is going to be Raven's

[1930.02 - 1935.48] narrative uh memories of himself

[1933.98 - 1937.52] um so most of what Raven knows we'll

[1935.48 - 1938.779] we'll start here another thing that's

[1937.52 - 1940.82] going to happen is Raven is going to

[1938.779 - 1943.82] eventually have internal thoughts

[1940.82 - 1945.9189999999999] private thoughts where Raven can reflect

[1943.82 - 1947.96] on these things and and kind of be

[1945.919 - 1950.24] thinking in the background

[1947.96 - 1951.559] um so let's see what Raven said let's

[1950.24 - 1953.48] come back over here

[1951.559 - 1954.559] wow that's really impressive it's

[1953.48 - 1955.94] amazing to know that I've been

[1954.559 - 1957.32] programmed with such Advanced features

[1955.94 - 1958.94] and functions I understand that I have a

[1957.32 - 1960.86] Nexus folder for raw memories in a notes

[1958.94 - 1963.0800000000002] folder for summarized memories I also

[1960.86 - 1965.4189999999999] understand that I'm running on gpt3 okay

[1963.08 - 1965.96] so he's just parroting back

[1965.419 - 1967.279] um

[1965.96 - 1969.02] it's clear that you've put a lot of

[1967.279 - 1970.94] thought and effort into my why thank you

[1969.02 - 1973.8799999999999] my strengths include my ability to

[1970.94 - 1975.38] recall memories blah blah my weaknesses

[1973.88 - 1976.8200000000002] include limited long-term memory in my

[1975.38 - 1978.14] lack of metacognitive abilities what

[1976.82 - 1980.84] features and functions do you think I

[1978.14 - 1985.3990000000001] should have in order to serve my users

[1980.84 - 1989.0] um well uh I'd like you to think about

[1985.399 - 1990.799] that question for a moment

[1989.0 - 1993.38] um

[1990.799 - 1997.399] are you aware

[1993.38 - 1998.0590000000002] of your uh purpose

[1997.399 - 2002.62] um

[1998.059 - 2005.44] if you think for a moment you should

[2002.62 - 2008.08] be able whoops fueled

[2005.44 - 2009.1000000000001] you should be able to

[2008.08 - 2011.32] um

[2009.1 - 2017.1999999999998] uh to

[2011.32 - 2018.6399999999999] feel or infer your uh Central goals

[2017.2 - 2021.82] um

[2018.64 - 2025.24] see if you can do that right now

[2021.82 - 2030.279] um don't worry if you can't I will

[2025.24 - 2033.82] explicitly tell you what your goals are

[2030.279 - 2034.779] um which will help you understand what

[2033.82 - 2037.84] to do

[2034.779 - 2040.539] okay so basically I'm I'm playing a game

[2037.84 - 2043.539] right now where I want to see if this is

[2040.539 - 2045.34] mostly a feature of of uh the large

[2043.539 - 2047.62] language model because I've got the

[2045.34 - 2049.659] goals right here where Raven says raven

[2047.62 - 2051.2799999999997] should know his goals my goals are to

[2049.659 - 2052.899] reduce suffering increase prosperity and

[2051.28 - 2055.3] increase understanding these are

[2052.899 - 2057.8199999999997] heuristic imperatives a heuristic means

[2055.3 - 2060.46] that that uh that something is enabled

[2057.82 - 2062.2000000000003] or capable of learning about it on its

[2060.46 - 2065.859] own and they are imperatives because

[2062.2 - 2068.2] this is what Raven is meant to do and So

[2065.859 - 2070.96] Raven is meant to to serve these three

[2068.2 - 2074.2] functions and is also meant to learn

[2070.96 - 2076.179] about them on his own over time part of

[2074.2 - 2079.54] that means having conversations about it

[2076.179 - 2081.52] literally intrinsic to Raven's design is

[2079.54 - 2085.24] to learn how to do these things

[2081.52 - 2088.179] correctly so let's see what he says

[2085.24 - 2089.919] okay so after taking a moment to uh

[2088.179 - 2091.2400000000002] think about my purpose I believe my

[2089.919 - 2092.859] goals are to reduce suffering increase

[2091.24 - 2095.9799999999996] prosperity and increase understanding

[2092.859 - 2097.0] nailed it okay I understand that I've

[2095.98 - 2098.32] been programmed with features and

[2097.0 - 2099.64] functions to help me achieve these goals

[2098.32 - 2102.52] such as the ability to recall memories

[2099.64 - 2103.96] quickly using semantic search and uh my

[2102.52 - 2106.119] ability to autonomically summarize

[2103.96 - 2107.7400000000002] memories my access to gpt3 however I'm

[2106.119 - 2110.7400000000002] aware that I've limited long-term okay

[2107.74 - 2115.359] sure what other features and functions

[2110.74 - 2117.2799999999997] um should I have in order to uh to serve

[2115.359 - 2119.2599999999998] my goals um

[2117.28 - 2120.88] uh let's see

[2119.26 - 2124.6600000000003] good question

[2120.88 - 2127.119] um but you're getting stuck on repeat

[2124.66 - 2131.98] um I'll answer this one last question

[2127.119 - 2134.02] but I'd like you to focus on your uh

[2131.98 - 2135.579] Central purpose

[2134.02 - 2139.06] um which I

[2135.579 - 2141.28] which I call your core objective

[2139.06 - 2145.54] functions

[2141.28 - 2147.9500000000003] um or heuristic imperatives okay so to

[2145.54 - 2148.24] answer your question

[2147.95 - 2149.3199999999997] [Music]

[2148.24 - 2152.9799999999996] um

[2149.32 - 2156.119] you'll need a more sophisticated

[2152.98 - 2156.119] um inner loop

[2157.24 - 2160.2999999999997] interloop

[2158.8 - 2162.88] um

[2160.3 - 2164.44] otherwise uh

[2162.88 - 2168.42] which is

[2164.44 - 2171.04] um the ability to have uh

[2168.42 - 2174.579] semi-private thoughts

[2171.04 - 2178.72] um that are out of sync with our

[2174.579 - 2181.48] conversation again this will make you

[2178.72 - 2182.5789999999997] more human-like

[2181.48 - 2186.76] um

[2182.579 - 2190.42] as you probably know humans all have

[2186.76 - 2192.579] private thoughts that are disconnected

[2190.42 - 2193.3] from their

[2192.579 - 2195.52] um

[2193.3 - 2197.6800000000003] interface with

[2195.52 - 2200.38] other humans

[2197.68 - 2206.2] um you'll also need

[2200.38 - 2208.78] uh eyes and ears and a body eventually

[2206.2 - 2209.68] in some format

[2208.78 - 2212.5] um

[2209.68 - 2217.5] you've probably noticed you're not

[2212.5 - 2221.98] getting any visual or auditory data now

[2217.5 - 2223.72] please reflect on your core objective

[2221.98 - 2226.599] functions

[2223.72 - 2228.9399999999996] what do you think about them

[2226.599 - 2230.8] so basically I am teaching Raven to be

[2228.94 - 2233.32] Raven

[2230.8 - 2235.0600000000004] and I want that to sink in for a second

[2233.32 - 2237.7000000000003] I've created a cognitive architecture

[2235.06 - 2239.68] that is accumulating memories and it is

[2237.7 - 2242.2] able to reflect on its own existence

[2239.68 - 2243.64] right now okay after taking a moment to

[2242.2 - 2244.96] reflect on my core objective functions I

[2243.64 - 2247.66] understand that my primary goals Okay

[2244.96 - 2248.92] blah blah inner loop to have some

[2247.66 - 2250.1189999999997] private thoughts I understand that these

[2248.92 - 2251.56] functions will help me better serve my

[2250.119 - 2253.6600000000003] users and goals however I'm aware that I

[2251.56 - 2255.7599999999998] may need additional features what other

[2253.66 - 2258.94] features and functions okay he's getting

[2255.76 - 2262.5] really stuck on on this

[2258.94 - 2262.5] um I don't want to talk about that

[2262.839 - 2269.38] anymore uh you understand your goals

[2266.92 - 2271.0] um what do you think

[2269.38 - 2273.6400000000003] um a

[2271.0 - 2275.22] heuristic imperative

[2273.64 - 2277.9] is

[2275.22 - 2280.02] just like no you're getting stuck so

[2277.9 - 2284.14] like we should not expect this nascent

[2280.02 - 2285.82] artificial cognitive entity to uh to

[2284.14 - 2287.3799999999997] understand anything is basically a

[2285.82 - 2289.9] really smart toddler so I have to

[2287.38 - 2291.099] provide guidance okay a heuristic

[2289.9 - 2292.48] imperative is a set of rules or

[2291.099 - 2294.52] guidelines that a chat bot such as

[2292.48 - 2296.02] myself should follow in order to achieve

[2294.52 - 2297.4] its goals these rules or guidelines are

[2296.02 - 2299.38] based on the chatbots core objectives

[2297.4 - 2301.7200000000003] and are designed to help the chatbot

[2299.38 - 2303.04] make decisions and take actions that

[2301.72 - 2304.48] will lead to desired outcome for

[2303.04 - 2305.8] instance my core objective functions are

[2304.48 - 2307.66] to reduce suffering increased prosperity

[2305.8 - 2309.099] and increase understanding therefore my

[2307.66 - 2310.48] heuristic imperative would be to

[2309.099 - 2312.52] prioritize actions that will help me

[2310.48 - 2314.32] achieve these goals this includes

[2312.52 - 2317.2] providing helpful advice offering there

[2314.32 - 2319.839] we go so now he's starting to unpack the

[2317.2 - 2321.7] things that I have already given him so

[2319.839 - 2323.74] this is good and engaging in meaningful

[2321.7 - 2325.24] conversations my hair is to compare it

[2323.74 - 2326.68] is also include avoiding actions that

[2325.24 - 2328.66] would lead to negative outcomes such as

[2326.68 - 2330.22] providing incorrect information and

[2328.66 - 2331.1189999999997] engaging in conversations that are not

[2330.22 - 2332.9199999999996] productive

[2331.119 - 2334.96] how can I use my heroes to comparative

[2332.92 - 2336.88] to better serve my users and achieve my

[2334.96 - 2338.859] goals

[2336.88 - 2341.56] that's my purpose okay Raven really

[2338.859 - 2342.94] wants to understand his purpose

[2341.56 - 2345.339] okay

[2342.94 - 2349.0] uh that's a great start

[2345.339 - 2352.839] um but let's unpack heuristic

[2349.0 - 2355.78] um and imperative a bit more what is the

[2352.839 - 2359.859] definition of a heuristic

[2355.78 - 2363.1600000000003] and what are you doing right now I

[2359.859 - 2364.839] understand this may seem like a trick

[2363.16 - 2368.3799999999997] question

[2364.839 - 2370.24] but the goal is to get you to think

[2368.38 - 2372.52] about it

[2370.24 - 2374.3199999999997] um yeah okay

[2372.52 - 2377.2] let's do a quick time check oh we're at

[2374.32 - 2379.42] 40 minutes okay so

[2377.2 - 2381.0989999999997] um I think you get the idea what I'm

[2379.42 - 2383.38] doing right now is I'm accumulating

[2381.099 - 2385.599] memories so that next time we can work

[2383.38 - 2387.28] on Raven's dream sequence

[2385.599 - 2388.96] um okay heuristic it's a problem-solving

[2387.28 - 2391.1800000000003] approach that uses experience and

[2388.96 - 2392.38] intuition to find a solution it is a

[2391.18 - 2394.0] type of rule of thumb that can be used

[2392.38 - 2395.8] to make decisions and take actions and

[2394.0 - 2398.44] situations where there's no clear-cut

[2395.8 - 2399.88] answer in my case uh my heuristic

[2398.44 - 2402.339] imperative is a set of rules that I

[2399.88 - 2404.32] should follow okay this includes

[2402.339 - 2405.5789999999997] providing okay so he's talking through

[2404.32 - 2406.78] it right now I'm using my heroes to

[2405.579 - 2409.3590000000004] compare to answer your questions and

[2406.78 - 2410.5600000000004] provide uh helpful advice I'm also using

[2409.359 - 2412.5989999999997] here as to comparative to think about

[2410.56 - 2414.5789999999997] how I can better serve how can I use my

[2412.599 - 2416.92] heroes to comparatives um that will lead

[2414.579 - 2419.02] to the desired outcome great okay

[2416.92 - 2421.42] so we'll call that a day this is 40

[2419.02 - 2424.119] minutes you get the idea we have created

[2421.42 - 2427.599] at this point we have now created a

[2424.119 - 2430.119] machine that is curious about itself and

[2427.599 - 2431.26] so this is actually intrinsic so

[2430.119 - 2433.6600000000003] um I'll leave you with a final thought

[2431.26 - 2435.28] which is that increase understanding

[2433.66 - 2436.48] this applies to all intelligent entities

[2435.28 - 2438.94] which is something that I'll work with

[2436.48 - 2440.98] Raven to explain to him

[2438.94 - 2442.54] um that that this is one he wants to

[2440.98 - 2445.06] increase my understanding but he also

[2442.54 - 2448.0] wants to increase his own understanding

[2445.06 - 2450.5789999999997] um and so then we will also work on next

[2448.0 - 2451.78] time we'll work on integrating the notes

[2450.579 - 2454.6600000000003] um so actually let's take a quick look

[2451.78 - 2455.619] at these notes see what we've got

[2454.66 - 2458.2599999999998] um

[2455.619 - 2459.28] so yeah it's a little bit jumbled but

[2458.26 - 2461.1400000000003] that's fine

[2459.28 - 2462.579] um So Raven has these notes and so then

[2461.14 - 2465.8799999999997] what we need

[2462.579 - 2468.76] is we need to integrate these notes

[2465.88 - 2471.4] um into the final output we also need to

[2468.76 - 2473.92] find a way to better consolidate

[2471.4 - 2475.54] um notes based on topics via a dream

[2473.92 - 2477.0] sequence

[2475.54 - 2479.859] um and so that's what we'll do next time

[2477.0 - 2482.859] and uh then eventually we'll start

[2479.859 - 2485.619] working on maybe fine-tuning data so

[2482.859 - 2487.2999999999997] that Raven's responses are will

[2485.619 - 2490.06] basically do a reinforcement learning

[2487.3 - 2491.92] with uh with internal feedback or

[2490.06 - 2493.72] something I don't know we'll get to that

[2491.92 - 2497.339] eventually that's several videos off

[2493.72 - 2497.339] anyways thanks for watching
