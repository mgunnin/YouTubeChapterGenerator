[0.12 - 5.12] one question that I get a lot is Dave

[3.04 - 7.319] you have made literally hundreds of

[5.12 - 9.96] videos and you know you've written a few

[7.319 - 12.759] books but the books are out of date and

[9.96 - 15.16] I want to use a chatbot to talk with you

[12.759 - 18.08] or you know otherwise use all all your

[15.16 - 20.4] material and so if you saw this video

[18.08 - 22.198999999999998] yesterday Matt wolf produced this video

[20.4 - 24.439] where he basically made a Mr Beast

[22.199 - 27.400000000000002] chatbot by downloading I think it was

[24.439 - 29.72] like 11 or 12 uh transcripts which is a

[27.4 - 32.599] really phenomenal idea but also I've

[29.72 - 35.0] been talking about mgpt and other ways

[32.599 - 38.48] of uh basically organizing arbitrarily

[35.0 - 41.44] large uh data sets so I went to one of

[38.48 - 44.48] my old repos where I had my YouTube

[41.44 - 47.239] chapter generator so uh if you've seen

[44.48 - 48.718999999999994] some of my older videos I I generated

[47.239 - 51.038999999999994] this thing where it would you know just

[48.719 - 53.719] download and and download the transcript

[51.039 - 55.32] from a video and make a uh set of

[53.719 - 56.76] YouTube chapters this is done

[55.32 - 58.559] automatically there's other services

[56.76 - 60.44] that do this now even YouTube will

[58.559 - 62.32] sometimes generate chapters for you

[60.44 - 64.36] so this project is kind of you know

[62.32 - 65.88] whatever um but if you want to see how

[64.36 - 69.159] it's done this is how it's done and this

[65.88 - 72.0] was back with gpt3 so with gp4 it's

[69.159 - 74.32000000000001] probably infinitely easier but in the

[72.0 - 75.72] service of doing this I wrote a script

[74.32 - 78.479] that literally it's just called download

[75.72 - 80.52] all transcripts and all it does is it

[78.479 - 82.159] goes to my channel and you can you can

[80.52 - 83.79899999999999] change it so that it will go to any

[82.159 - 86.43900000000001] channel you just change the channel ID

[83.799 - 89.43900000000001] here um and it will download literally

[86.439 - 93.39899999999999] every transcript um so here you can see

[89.439 - 95.96] that I have 270 plus transcripts from

[93.399 - 98.64] all of my videos this is obviously a

[95.96 - 101.19999999999999] potentially highly valuable uh Corpus of

[98.64 - 102.64] training data now one thing is that I

[101.2 - 105.07900000000001] think people are coming to terms with

[102.64 - 107.64] the fact that fine tuning is not useful

[105.079 - 109.63999999999999] for uh knowledge representation we're

[107.64 - 113.24] now in the age of retrieval augmented

[109.64 - 115.64] generation and basically mgpt is just a

[113.24 - 117.88] retrieval system it's not a particularly

[115.64 - 119.36] sophisticated memory system and one

[117.88 - 121.56] thing that I want to address is like yes

[119.36 - 123.52] I can be very highly critical of

[121.56 - 125.2] scientific papers I'm notoriously

[123.52 - 127.32] difficult to impress I'm sorry if this

[125.2 - 129.31900000000002] frustrates some people um another thing

[127.32 - 130.51999999999998] that I wanted to address is that some

[129.319 - 132.56] members of the audience are more

[130.52 - 134.68] scientifically minded and some members

[132.56 - 136.44] of the audience are more engineering and

[134.68 - 139.12] coding minded where they just want

[136.44 - 140.4] practical results so sometimes I'll be

[139.12 - 142.31900000000002] talking about things from a more

[140.4 - 144.64000000000001] scientific lens and sometimes I'll be

[142.319 - 147.11999999999998] talking from a more pragmatic lens so my

[144.64 - 150.319] criticism of mgpt is is more from the

[147.12 - 152.8] pragmatic lens um and yes I'm aware that

[150.319 - 154.44] there are AB testing and all sorts of

[152.8 - 156.56] more scientifically rigorous things that

[154.44 - 160.519] I can do and I apologize again if that

[156.56 - 162.48] frustrates you anyways moving on so the

[160.519 - 164.64000000000001] uh basically we've got this huge Corpus

[162.48 - 166.599] of valuable data here so if you want to

[164.64 - 167.83999999999997] understand how my mind works and all

[166.599 - 170.04] that stuff you can download these

[167.84 - 172.879] transcripts it's all free um and do

[170.04 - 175.44] whatever you want with it um just don't

[172.879 - 178.64] you know do anything creepy uh not that

[175.44 - 182.8] anyone would I don't think anyways so

[178.64 - 185.48] now yesterday I created a video about uh

[182.8 - 186.959] latent space activation um so a few

[185.48 - 189.67999999999998] recent Concepts that I've been working

[186.959 - 192.159] on I made another video talking about

[189.68 - 193.87900000000002] sparse priming representations so if you

[192.159 - 197.04] haven't seen that a sparse priming

[193.879 - 199.07999999999998] representation is a way of activating

[197.04 - 201.959] certain aspects of a large language

[199.08 - 204.08] model without having the full bulk of it

[201.959 - 206.31900000000002] and so this this banks on the fact that

[204.08 - 208.76000000000002] large language models are associative

[206.319 - 210.56] just like human memory is however large

[208.76 - 212.84] language models have read literally

[210.56 - 214.76] hundreds of lifetimes worth of text so

[212.84 - 217.04] you only need to remind them of a few

[214.76 - 218.79899999999998] key facts or features or assertions

[217.04 - 221.159] about stuff even things that are outside

[218.799 - 224.0] of its training uh distribution and it

[221.159 - 225.879] can then adopt and use new Concepts you

[224.0 - 228.4] can teach it new terms you can teach it

[225.879 - 231.159] new events all sorts of stuff using

[228.4 - 233.28] sparse priming representations and you

[231.159 - 235.67999999999998] can compress relatively large things I

[233.28 - 237.76] actually took um my systems thinking

[235.68 - 240.0] book that I'm working on and gave it to

[237.76 - 241.56] Claude And I asked Claude to create a

[240.0 - 243.64] sparse priming representation of my

[241.56 - 245.48] systems thinking book and it was able to

[243.64 - 248.55999999999997] compress it down to about a page and

[245.48 - 250.56] then unpack most of it now this is

[248.56 - 252.92000000000002] basically a form of semantic compression

[250.56 - 254.959] or you might say uh from a mathematical

[252.92 - 258.71999999999997] perspective it's like a semantic PCA

[254.959 - 261.32] principal uh component analysis um but

[258.72 - 264.40000000000003] anyways the idea here is that it is a

[261.32 - 266.199] form of lossy verbal compression um but

[264.4 - 267.79999999999995] because llms have the ability to

[266.199 - 271.12] confabulate which means that they can

[267.8 - 273.0] infer or impute uh or kind of guess um

[271.12 - 275.32] sparse priming representations are super

[273.0 - 277.0] useful uh and then yesterday I talked

[275.32 - 278.52] about lat and space Activation so lat

[277.0 - 280.96] and space activation is kind of the

[278.52 - 283.639] broader concept of what's going on

[280.96 - 286.4] behind the scenes inside of the model

[283.639 - 288.08] and then uh also yesterday I mentioned

[286.4 - 290.59999999999997] uh something that I was working on which

[288.08 - 293.84] is what I call the Basher Loop or bshr

[290.6 - 296.8] so bshr is the point of today's video

[293.84 - 300.0] and this stands for brainstorm search

[296.8 - 302.24] hypothesize and refine so I'm married a

[300.0 - 304.8] librarian um so this basically

[302.24 - 307.16] constitutes dinner conversation for us

[304.8 - 309.88] but in the field of information and uh

[307.16 - 311.56] librar science uh people have

[309.88 - 313.36] information needs this is why you go to

[311.56 - 315.36] Google this is why you go to Wikipedia

[313.36 - 318.56] or even you search Reddit or

[315.36 - 320.68] YouTube now there are tools out there

[318.56 - 324.919] like perplexity like the chatbot that

[320.68 - 326.40000000000003] Matt wolf built um but there's one thing

[324.919 - 328.479] a few things missing from all of these

[326.4 - 331.19899999999996] tools and that is information literacy

[328.479 - 332.8] and information for strategies so I am

[331.199 - 335.28000000000003] here to teach you about that and we are

[332.8 - 338.8] also here to um introduce the Basher

[335.28 - 340.79999999999995] Loop uh repo which is brand new um but

[338.8 - 344.84000000000003] basically the ultimate goal here is to

[340.8 - 347.039] create a Basher Loop uh Search tool

[344.84 - 350.0] chatbot that will allow you to search

[347.039 - 351.479] literally all of my videos um so there's

[350.0 - 353.28] a lot of steps to do we're not going to

[351.479 - 355.8] finish it today but I wanted to take

[353.28 - 357.4] this time to one introduce the repo

[355.8 - 360.24] introduce the concepts and show you the

[357.4 - 361.88] work that I've already done so so uh

[360.24 - 365.12] when you first get to the repo it's just

[361.88 - 367.8] Dave shap bshr Loop or Basher loop as I

[365.12 - 371.12] as I say it out loud um so the Basher

[367.8 - 373.72] Loop welcome to the uh you know uh the

[371.12 - 376.24] repo uh it allows you to search for AR

[373.72 - 378.28000000000003] arbitrarily large information domains um

[376.24 - 379.88] this is what it means the overview so

[378.28 - 382.15999999999997] the overview of the loop first

[379.88 - 385.759] brainstorm it accepts a query from the

[382.16 - 387.199] user it brainstorms a list of of of

[385.759 - 388.44] questions which I showed you yesterday

[387.199 - 391.199] and I'll show you the prompt that I used

[388.44 - 393.52] to do it uh today in just a little bit

[391.199 - 396.16] then you use uh search functionality

[393.52 - 398.31899999999996] whether it's you know apis or vector

[396.16 - 400.52000000000004] database or whatever the queries that

[398.319 - 402.47900000000004] you start with are then basically just

[400.52 - 404.75899999999996] piped to whatever your information tap

[402.479 - 408.56] is or if you have multiple information

[404.759 - 410.91900000000004] TS you can use that then hypothesize so

[408.56 - 412.96] you take the information that is

[410.919 - 415.68] retrieved from your data source whether

[412.96 - 418.479] it is wikkipedia or a vector database or

[415.68 - 421.36] just a general internet search um and

[418.479 - 423.68] then you have the llm read all of it and

[421.36 - 426.759] form a hypothesis based on that

[423.68 - 429.479] information this hypothesis is an answer

[426.759 - 431.199] to the potential question it says okay

[429.479 - 432.71999999999997] based on everything that you're seeing

[431.199 - 435.40000000000003] this is the answer and if you want to

[432.72 - 437.0] try this this is basically what uh

[435.4 - 439.039] perplexity does but it does it as a

[437.0 - 441.24] single step where it just searches and

[439.039 - 443.84] summarizes it doesn't really form a

[441.24 - 446.039] hypothesis uh nor does it actually write

[443.84 - 448.31899999999996] good queries which is my chief complaint

[446.039 - 451.52] and why I canceled my perplexity

[448.319 - 455.0] subscription um and then finally refine

[451.52 - 457.12] so this is refine or recurse or whatever

[455.0 - 459.84] but the idea is you don't just do one

[457.12 - 461.16] information search you like think about

[459.84 - 463.479] the last time that you had a really

[461.16 - 465.12] challenging problem what do you do you

[463.479 - 467.24] do a Google search you open a bunch of

[465.12 - 468.84000000000003] tabs you read a few things you read a

[467.24 - 470.68] few more things and then you learn about

[468.84 - 472.52] the space and then you go write a better

[470.68 - 474.96] information query you write a better

[472.52 - 477.599] search query so this is the loop this is

[474.96 - 479.479] why it is a loop is because finding and

[477.599 - 482.039] using the correct information is not not

[479.479 - 483.56] a singl step process when you go to the

[482.039 - 485.87899999999996] library whether it's the University

[483.56 - 487.12] library or the local city library you

[485.879 - 489.03900000000004] what do you do you go you talk to a

[487.12 - 490.52] librar and they ask you a bunch of

[489.039 - 493.56] questions about what you're trying to

[490.52 - 495.08] achieve and then you uh you know you go

[493.56 - 496.599] look at a book and you take some notes

[495.08 - 499.19899999999996] and it's like okay cool I liked this

[496.599 - 502.599] book but now that you're informed you go

[499.199 - 505.24] from a naive query to an informed query

[502.599 - 507.12] real quick Dave here with a request so

[505.24 - 508.919] You' probably noticed that I'm cranking

[507.12 - 511.159] out videos and I'm really getting my

[508.919 - 513.88] content dialed into what is adding the

[511.159 - 516.24] most value to you guys and so I'm really

[513.88 - 518.599] doubling down on subscriber growth and

[516.24 - 520.279] just really serving the community now

[518.599 - 521.88] the reason that I've been able to

[520.279 - 523.599] increase the quality of my videos and

[521.88 - 526.16] the frequency is because I've stepped

[523.599 - 528.1600000000001] away from Consulting more than half my

[526.16 - 529.8] income came from Consulting so I'm

[528.16 - 532.0799999999999] really kind of hurting for cash right

[529.8 - 534.16] now however I have been largely

[532.08 - 536.5600000000001] supported by a Grassroots movement so my

[534.16 - 539.6] request is Hop on over to my patreon

[536.56 - 541.64] page and sign up the lowest tier is $5 a

[539.6 - 542.88] month and that gets you access to

[541.64 - 545.16] Discord which I'll show you in just a

[542.88 - 546.56] moment but I also have a premium Discord

[545.16 - 549.3199999999999] tier which gives you access to some

[546.56 - 551.959] private channels some live streams and

[549.32 - 554.2] QA sessions and that sort of thing so if

[551.959 - 556.16] you could help me out and you'll get

[554.2 - 557.8000000000001] access to this community uh and it's a

[556.16 - 559.68] great Community we've got almost 600

[557.8 - 561.959] people right now and we talk about all

[559.68 - 564.1999999999999] kinds of stuff not just AI we talk about

[561.959 - 566.279] the future of humanity we have artistic

[564.2 - 568.279] uh interest we talk about economics we

[566.279 - 570.12] talk about existential coping post-

[568.279 - 572.16] labor economics all of the above and

[570.12 - 575.12] then finally I also have some premium

[572.16 - 577.7199999999999] channels for the high tier subscribers

[575.12 - 580.16] so thanks for watching and uh yeah thank

[577.72 - 582.8000000000001] you you go from a naive query to an

[580.16 - 584.04] informed query so in this is where I'll

[582.8 - 585.519] go down and I'm not going to read all of

[584.04 - 587.24] these to you verbatim but I'm just

[585.519 - 588.6] pointing out that this information is

[587.24 - 590.399] here in the repost so that you can get

[588.6 - 592.0400000000001] familiar because I'm assuming that most

[590.399 - 593.399] of you are not familiar with librarian

[592.04 - 595.16] information science so here's some

[593.399 - 597.48] critical things that I can teach you so

[595.16 - 599.16] that you can make informed queries so

[597.48 - 601.0790000000001] first of all what we're talking about is

[599.16 - 603.56] information foraging information

[601.079 - 605.88] foraging is when you go into an unknown

[603.56 - 607.4399999999999] or incomplete information domain where

[605.88 - 609.0] you have an information need but you

[607.44 - 611.1600000000001] don't necessarily even know what

[609.0 - 613.2] questions to ask so you have to go in

[611.16 - 614.3199999999999] search of information by basically

[613.2 - 617.12] starting out

[614.32 - 618.88] guessing information literacy is one of

[617.12 - 621.079] the primary things that I complain about

[618.88 - 623.959] both with uh these tools and humans in

[621.079 - 626.8] general um so information literacy is

[623.959 - 629.079] basically understanding uh how to engage

[626.8 - 631.5999999999999] with sources of information um in order

[629.079 - 633.64] order to find correct information or

[631.6 - 634.76] validate the information that you have

[633.64 - 636.68] and this is something that I talked

[634.76 - 638.959] about yesterday and we'll also show you

[636.68 - 641.079] in just a moment where the way that I

[638.959 - 643.88] build information literacy into this

[641.079 - 645.7199999999999] tool is by telling the llm during the

[643.88 - 648.0] brainstorm phase to generate

[645.72 - 649.44] counterfactual questions basically it's

[648.0 - 651.88] trying to prove itself wrong and it's

[649.44 - 654.0790000000001] trying to find all sides of Any Given

[651.88 - 658.12] information problem which will result in

[654.079 - 660.3599999999999] a better uh recall um with recall is a

[658.12 - 662.279] very specific term from library science

[660.36 - 664.0790000000001] where basically are you getting all of

[662.279 - 667.519] the information that is relevant that is

[664.079 - 670.12] Salient to your query um so next up is

[667.519 - 674.519] satisficing so satisficing is a

[670.12 - 677.44] portmanto of um sufficing and satisfying

[674.519 - 679.32] so when you satisfy an information query

[677.44 - 681.6] the idea is that you have found you have

[679.32 - 683.36] gotten to the level of good enough it's

[681.6 - 685.88] not perfect it's not complete but you

[683.36 - 689.0790000000001] have the information that you imminently

[685.88 - 691.16] need and you're ready to move on so one

[689.079 - 693.079] example that you can use for satisficing

[691.16 - 695.399] is when you're looking for a restaurant

[693.079 - 697.2399999999999] to go to there are that you might have

[695.399 - 698.72] in your mind the perfect restaurant but

[697.24 - 700.8] the perfect restaurant might not be

[698.72 - 702.6800000000001] available it might be too far uh it

[700.8 - 704.16] might just not even exist and so what

[702.68 - 706.8389999999999] you do is you look for something that is

[704.16 - 708.92] good enough and so the idea is that

[706.839 - 711.0790000000001] within information foraging within

[708.92 - 713.88] search you need to satisfice from time

[711.079 - 715.3599999999999] to time which means that the information

[713.88 - 717.48] the exact information that you need

[715.36 - 719.44] might not be available a definitive

[717.48 - 721.279] answer to your question might not even

[719.44 - 723.0790000000001] be possible if you watch the video that

[721.279 - 725.6] I made yesterday one of the things that

[723.079 - 728.079] I asked was what is the exact Coastline

[725.6 - 730.9590000000001] of Britain and the answer that it gave

[728.079 - 732.8389999999999] me was well that's really hard to

[730.959 - 735.16] determine but here's how you could go

[732.839 - 736.6800000000001] about it and so that the answer to the

[735.16 - 738.76] information query that I had the

[736.68 - 741.519] information need was not a definitive

[738.76 - 743.519] answer but rather uh this is how you

[741.519 - 745.9590000000001] approach that information problem so in

[743.519 - 748.04] that case the what what it needed to do

[745.959 - 750.76] was outside of the scope of information

[748.04 - 752.76] foraging um information needs so I've

[750.76 - 755.0] referred to this before but basically

[752.76 - 757.48] all problems are a form of information

[755.0 - 760.56] need so an information need is I have

[757.48 - 763.0790000000001] some sort of problem solution query

[760.56 - 765.5999999999999] whatever and I need information in order

[763.079 - 768.4399999999999] to be able to tackle this whether you're

[765.6 - 771.1990000000001] a CEO making making strategic decisions

[768.44 - 772.8800000000001] about AI whether you're uh you know a

[771.199 - 775.3199999999999] broke college student whose car is

[772.88 - 777.16] making funny noises whether you're in a

[775.32 - 778.6800000000001] relationship and you want to know like

[777.16 - 780.7199999999999] how do I navigate this fight that we

[778.68 - 783.6389999999999] just just had literally everything you

[780.72 - 785.6] do in life isn't has information needs

[783.639 - 788.16] um and this is why libraries are super

[785.6 - 789.519] underrated as well as Librarians um but

[788.16 - 794.199] of course I am biased because I married

[789.519 - 795.9590000000001] a librarian now um this is a term that I

[794.199 - 797.88] invent at least as far as I know that I

[795.959 - 800.2399999999999] invented so there's what's called a

[797.88 - 801.959] naive query so a naive query is

[800.24 - 803.88] something that everyone does where you

[801.959 - 805.4399999999999] go to Google and you you don't even know

[803.88 - 808.399] the right questions to ask so you just

[805.44 - 810.639] kind of guess you just launch your best

[808.399 - 812.279] guess out into the ether and then Google

[810.639 - 813.839] gives you back some stuff that it you

[812.279 - 816.16] know Google has a lot of really good

[813.839 - 818.8800000000001] algorithms so it can kind of infer what

[816.16 - 820.199] you're actually looking for um and and

[818.88 - 822.399] the reason that it can do this is

[820.199 - 825.56] because lots of other people before you

[822.399 - 827.279] have have launched those naive queries

[825.56 - 828.88] and Google Tracks where they ultimately

[827.279 - 830.959] end up and it says okay based on what

[828.88 - 833.079] you're looking for based on what you put

[830.959 - 835.16] in I'm predicting that this is actually

[833.079 - 837.199] the page that you're looking for so you

[835.16 - 839.6] launch a naive query because you don't

[837.199 - 841.3599999999999] know what you don't know once you know a

[839.6 - 843.1990000000001] little bit more then you can write an

[841.36 - 845.72] informed query because like let's say

[843.199 - 846.88] for instance you start with you know the

[845.72 - 849.72] one of the questions that I asked

[846.88 - 852.079] yesterday which was uh who were the

[849.72 - 855.6] important Senators during the uh peak of

[852.079 - 857.6389999999999] Roman power right you might not know

[855.6 - 859.6] that there is a thing called Pax Romana

[857.639 - 861.759] so part of the part of what you would

[859.6 - 863.9590000000001] find during that query is you know the

[861.759 - 866.32] Pax Romana or as someone pointed out in

[863.959 - 868.7589999999999] the comments Rome was a kingdom first

[866.32 - 871.1990000000001] then a republic then an Empire so

[868.759 - 873.759] depends on how you define like you know

[871.199 - 875.92] Empire versus Senate you know where how

[873.759 - 878.1990000000001] do you define the peak of Roman power

[875.92 - 881.079] and so you can then integrate all of

[878.199 - 884.199] those bits of information to ask better

[881.079 - 886.519] questions like uh you know was Rome more

[884.199 - 888.399] powerful as a republic was Rome more

[886.519 - 890.16] powerful as an Empire now of course

[888.399 - 892.079] large language models already know most

[890.16 - 893.68] of these things um which is why the

[892.079 - 895.4399999999999] Basher Loop can actually work in a

[893.68 - 897.3199999999999] vacuum for things particularly

[895.44 - 899.639] historical information that have been

[897.32 - 901.12] discussed to death but but as other

[899.639 - 902.88] people pointed out in the comments

[901.12 - 904.88] there's lots of data out there that is

[902.88 - 906.8] just not in the training distribution

[904.88 - 910.36] like your personal data like my YouTube

[906.8 - 913.199] transcripts like corporate data um so

[910.36 - 915.6] once you have your naive query you you

[913.199 - 917.7589999999999] you know a little bit more then you can

[915.6 - 920.639] dial into an information sent which is

[917.759 - 922.04] like okay here are some Clues to what

[920.639 - 924.24] I'm actually looking for and then you

[922.04 - 925.959] can write an informed query and then I

[924.24 - 927.639] already mentioned uh precision versus

[925.959 - 930.5999999999999] recall I'm not going to read that one to

[927.639 - 933.5600000000001] you and finally there's some use cases

[930.6 - 935.279] um so I've kind of alluded to all these

[933.56 - 937.279] you could apply the Basher Loop to the

[935.279 - 939.12] business data Lake to an internet search

[937.279 - 941.319] to a University Library system or a

[939.12 - 943.68] personal archive in the case of my

[941.319 - 945.4399999999999] transcripts so I've got all the

[943.68 - 947.399] transcripts saved here you can go

[945.44 - 951.12] through them all there's obviously quite

[947.399 - 954.079] a few uh yeah so there's that and then

[951.12 - 956.519] finally or not finally but next is

[954.079 - 957.519] contributing so I've got uh there's

[956.519 - 959.16] there's three ways that you can

[957.519 - 961.0] contribute or participate

[959.16 - 963.4399999999999] and the order is listed so please make

[961.0 - 966.36] sure you check the contributing uh file

[963.44 - 968.36] before jumping in first is join the

[966.36 - 970.72] discussions um this is where everyone

[968.36 - 972.5600000000001] should start um don't just jump in

[970.72 - 975.0790000000001] immediately submitting issues and PLL

[972.56 - 976.319] requests um if they're not if they don't

[975.079 - 979.2399999999999] follow the guidelines here they'll be

[976.319 - 981.88] closed and rejected um but yeah so check

[979.24 - 983.04] out the contributing markdown file um if

[981.88 - 984.639] you're not familiar with this the

[983.04 - 986.16] discussions tab is up here so you can

[984.639 - 988.24] jump in there's no discussions yet cuz I

[986.16 - 990.04] just created the repo there's issues

[988.24 - 991.839] here uh again no issues have been

[990.04 - 993.8] created and there's no PLL uh there's no

[991.839 - 998.399] poll requests yet either all

[993.8 - 1000.8] right so then I've created demo 01 so

[998.399 - 1003.959] this one will be um before we get all

[1000.8 - 1005.88] the way into uh you know building our

[1003.959 - 1008.56] own local repository our own local

[1005.88 - 1009.639] database on my YouTube transcripts um

[1008.56 - 1012.279] first we're just going to use an

[1009.639 - 1015.0790000000001] existing information Source specifically

[1012.279 - 1018.0] Wikipedia so I've got the pro the the

[1015.079 - 1020.8389999999999] project defined here um I showed a very

[1018.0 - 1023.0] naive uh like initial test yesterday

[1020.839 - 1025.28] I've got the code copied here it doesn't

[1023.0 - 1026.959] work yet so don't you know don't lower

[1025.28 - 1028.72] your expectations we are still very

[1026.959 - 1031.64] early in the process but what I did want

[1028.72 - 1033.799] to show you was that demo1 is here it's

[1031.64 - 1036.0] got its own read me and I also the the

[1033.799 - 1038.24] work that I did do is that I already

[1036.0 - 1040.48] wrote the system prompts so let me let's

[1038.24 - 1042.76] go through these one at a time so this

[1040.48 - 1044.88] is the system prompt for for 01 the

[1042.76 - 1047.64] brainstorming one now what I had

[1044.88 - 1049.679] yesterday was just this bit so you're a

[1047.64 - 1051.4] search query generator yada yada

[1049.679 - 1053.919] basically it generates a list of

[1051.4 - 1056.2] questions um in a Json object that can

[1053.919 - 1058.919] be used to do Google searches or

[1056.2 - 1061.3600000000001] Wikipedia searches or whatever uh and so

[1058.919 - 1064.6000000000001] this is the first part of the process

[1061.36 - 1066.6789999999999] that will be used to generate uh the the

[1064.6 - 1069.6789999999999] brainstorm step of the Basher Loop so

[1066.679 - 1072.8400000000001] brainstorm a list of questions um but

[1069.679 - 1076.0] then what I added was refine queries so

[1072.84 - 1077.8799999999999] this in this integrates that idea of

[1076.0 - 1080.84] whatever information you give the chat

[1077.88 - 1082.4] GPT API um if you don't give it any

[1080.84 - 1085.559] previous queries it'll be like okay

[1082.4 - 1087.039] whatever but if you do it will integrate

[1085.559 - 1089.12] it if these materials are present you

[1087.039 - 1090.799] are to generate informed queries more

[1089.12 - 1092.84] specific search queries that aim to zero

[1090.799 - 1094.8799999999999] in on the correct information domain Do

[1092.84 - 1096.72] Not Duplicate previously asked questions

[1094.88 - 1099.0390000000002] use the notes and other information to

[1096.72 - 1101.44] write better questions basically so this

[1099.039 - 1102.96] one prompt will be will be part of the

[1101.44 - 1104.72] Basher Loop so whether it's the first

[1102.96 - 1106.96] time you're running it or subsequent

[1104.72 - 1109.6000000000001] times it will generate recur uh

[1106.96 - 1112.64] recursively better uh search

[1109.6 - 1116.52] queries so that's the first bit um so I

[1112.64 - 1118.64] wrote that and then going back to uh

[1116.52 - 1121.039] system O2 so the second part is

[1118.64 - 1123.24] hypothesize obviously the the search

[1121.039 - 1125.48] part that's to be handled by an API or

[1123.24 - 1127.6] chroma DB or whatever so you don't need

[1125.48 - 1129.6] a system prompt for that because uh

[1127.6 - 1132.1589999999999] basically the that that's that's an

[1129.6 - 1134.0] algorithmic thing that is just a script

[1132.159 - 1137.88] um so the next step that is handled by

[1134.0 - 1140.36] the llm is the hypothesis generator so

[1137.88 - 1142.159] like like the like the brainstorming the

[1140.36 - 1143.799] query generator you're an information

[1142.159 - 1145.679] needs hypothesis generator you'll be

[1143.799 - 1147.8799999999999] given a main information need or user

[1145.679 - 1149.4] query as well as a variety of materials

[1147.88 - 1150.8400000000001] such as search results previous

[1149.4 - 1152.159] hypotheses and notes whatever

[1150.84 - 1153.48] information you receive your output

[1152.159 - 1155.88] should be a revised refined or an

[1153.48 - 1157.559] improved hypothesis in this case the

[1155.88 - 1160.0800000000002] hypothesis is a comprehensive answer to

[1157.559 - 1161.3999999999999] the user question etc etc etc basically

[1160.08 - 1163.48] I'm just giving in instructions that

[1161.4 - 1166.039] whatever I give you generate a

[1163.48 - 1168.3600000000001] hypothesis that answers the user query

[1166.039 - 1169.84] as comprehensively as possible I tell it

[1168.36 - 1173.559] to worry about citations because we'll

[1169.84 - 1174.76] hold that out as metadata um and so

[1173.559 - 1177.36] that's some that's a problem that we

[1174.76 - 1181.1589999999999] need to work out um okay and then

[1177.36 - 1182.6789999999999] finally the satisficing check so I'm

[1181.159 - 1184.3200000000002] guessing that this is probably the first

[1182.679 - 1186.6000000000001] time that most of you have heard about

[1184.32 - 1188.48] satisficing um so here's the instruction

[1186.6 - 1191.1589999999999] that I wrote In order to produce this

[1188.48 - 1192.6] and I'll explain why um but the the very

[1191.159 - 1195.5590000000002] short answer is I'm going to give you a

[1192.6 - 1198.6] bunch of information and then you judge

[1195.559 - 1200.28] you being the llm uh GPT you judge

[1198.6 - 1202.4399999999998] whether or not the information need has

[1200.28 - 1203.9189999999999] been satisfied and then I tell it like

[1202.44 - 1205.919] you're to make this judgment by virtue

[1203.919 - 1208.44] of several factors amount and quality of

[1205.919 - 1210.64] searches specific specificity and

[1208.44 - 1212.0800000000002] comprehensiveness of the hypothesis and

[1210.64 - 1214.48] the notes about the information domain

[1212.08 - 1217.12] and foraging if present so basically we

[1214.48 - 1219.919] can include notes from the search part

[1217.12 - 1221.6399999999999] to say hey we've exhausted all the

[1219.919 - 1224.0] search like we're not finding anything

[1221.64 - 1226.159] else and you can see that we've run you

[1224.0 - 1228.48] know 30 queries and this is the best

[1226.159 - 1229.64] information we've got um so you know

[1228.48 - 1231.679] several things to keep in mind the

[1229.64 - 1234.039] user's information need might not be

[1231.679 - 1235.76] answerable so in the in the case of you

[1234.039 - 1238.559] know asking what is the exact Coastline

[1235.76 - 1240.679] of Britain um you might want to see a

[1238.559 - 1242.32] specific number um or it might be

[1240.679 - 1243.919] partially answerable which is like you

[1242.32 - 1246.36] know it's generally estimated to be

[1243.919 - 1249.5590000000002] about I think it was like 12,000 kilm or

[1246.36 - 1252.24] something like that um or given the

[1249.559 - 1254.0] information uh available for the problem

[1252.24 - 1256.4] basically some things are outside of the

[1254.0 - 1258.919] scope of information needs for instance

[1256.4 - 1261.5590000000002] if you need to uh to actually do

[1258.919 - 1263.44] something in the physical world right so

[1261.559 - 1265.0] like you might go to the library and say

[1263.44 - 1266.96] like I need to file my taxes and it's

[1265.0 - 1268.84] like well I'm a librarian I can't file

[1266.96 - 1270.08] your taxes but I can give you all the

[1268.84 - 1273.3999999999999] information that you will need to be

[1270.08 - 1275.1999999999998] able to file your taxes so tool use and

[1273.4 - 1277.88] acting upon the world is outside of the

[1275.2 - 1280.0] scope of the Basher Loop but the idea is

[1277.88 - 1281.6000000000001] if the information is available we will

[1280.0 - 1283.2] give you all the information that we can

[1281.6 - 1286.0] get we will basically act like a

[1283.2 - 1287.52] librarian and be your information coner

[1286.0 - 1289.72] to get you the information that you need

[1287.52 - 1291.52] that you can then go take and you know

[1289.72 - 1293.159] give to another AI or a chatbot or a

[1291.52 - 1294.12] robot or your best friend or do it

[1293.159 - 1297.0390000000002] yourself or

[1294.12 - 1300.08] whatever anyways finally the output

[1297.039 - 1301.84] format is a Json object so there's two

[1300.08 - 1303.799] things that I put in the Json object one

[1301.84 - 1306.799] is feedback which is basically it

[1303.799 - 1309.6] unpacking what its perception is and the

[1306.799 - 1311.52] reason that I do this first is because

[1309.6 - 1313.559] as language models kind of talk through

[1311.52 - 1315.279] things it'll be able to triangulate and

[1313.559 - 1317.279] make a judgment or a decision a little

[1315.279 - 1320.279] bit better because as you might have

[1317.279 - 1322.799] seen on a I explains videos if you have

[1320.279 - 1325.08] a language model just output an answer

[1322.799 - 1327.08] like if if you give it a whole list of

[1325.08 - 1329.6] stuff and then just ask it to say true

[1327.08 - 1332.36] or false it's going to be kind of random

[1329.6 - 1335.24] but as I demonstrated in uh yesterday's

[1332.36 - 1336.799] video with sequential reasoning um large

[1335.24 - 1339.159] language models because you get more

[1336.799 - 1341.2] latent space activation with sequential

[1339.159 - 1344.2] activation this is also a form of

[1341.2 - 1345.6000000000001] sequential activation wherein it talks

[1344.2 - 1347.48] through the evidence that you've

[1345.6 - 1349.9599999999998] presented and then it will make a better

[1347.48 - 1352.279] judgment as to whether or not the user

[1349.96 - 1354.48] uh information need has been satisfied

[1352.279 - 1356.64] that's the tldr of all of this and I

[1354.48 - 1360.2] think that brings us to a the conclusion

[1356.64 - 1363.3600000000001] for today so that's where we're at this

[1360.2 - 1365.279] is where we're starting um I'm probably

[1363.36 - 1367.24] going to be working on this for a little

[1365.279 - 1369.279] bit this project isn't going to live too

[1367.24 - 1372.36] terribly long um it's probably going to

[1369.279 - 1374.24] be a three or four part series we'll see

[1372.36 - 1375.9599999999998] um but yeah so thanks for tuning in I

[1374.24 - 1378.78] hope you got a lot out of this like

[1375.96 - 1381.93] subscribe etc etc you know the drill

[1378.78 - 1381.93] [Music]

[1385.0 - 1388.0] cheers
