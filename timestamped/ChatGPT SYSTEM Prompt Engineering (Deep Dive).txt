[0.48 - 8.519] I get a lot of questions about how best

[3.959 - 10.98] to use the chat GPT API so if you are a

[8.519 - 13.2] chat GPT user you might be familiar with

[10.98 - 16.199] custom instructions so the custom

[13.2 - 17.939999999999998] instructions panel that they added uh

[16.199 - 20.699] just a few months ago basically gives

[17.94 - 23.520000000000003] you the ability to tell chat GPT a

[20.699 - 26.64] little bit about yourself as well as how

[23.52 - 28.68] you want it to respond every time now

[26.64 - 31.439] this is called chat GPT custom

[28.68 - 33.84] instructions but from an API perspective

[31.439 - 35.7] on the back end which that's primarily

[33.84 - 39.540000000000006] who this video is for is not necessarily

[35.7 - 41.64] the chat GPT users but the API users on

[39.54 - 42.96] the back end the way that this looks is

[41.64 - 46.02] that there is what's called a system

[42.96 - 48.18] window so if you ever hear me refer to a

[46.02 - 51.059000000000005] system window this is what I mean

[48.18 - 53.82] and the system window is a sort of out

[51.059 - 56.059] of band set of instructions that allows

[53.82 - 58.26] you to give it any kind of content

[56.059 - 59.419999999999995] whether you're providing IT background

[58.26 - 63.059] information

[59.42 - 65.28] instructions uh or whatever I sometimes

[63.059 - 67.74] will put in entire articles here and

[65.28 - 70.32000000000001] then use the use the chat to actually

[67.74 - 72.83999999999999] discuss the article this is how I have

[70.32 - 75.77999999999999] approached for instance using the API

[72.84 - 80.159] for fiction so for instance with the

[75.78 - 83.82] most recent uh models you have uh for

[80.159 - 86.4] instance uh GPT 3.5 turbo 16k you have

[83.82 - 89.33999999999999] 16 000 tokens which is more than enough

[86.4 - 90.9] for any chapter of a novel or a short

[89.34 - 93.96000000000001] story and then you can talk about that

[90.9 - 96.42] chapter that's how I get rapid feedback

[93.96 - 98.46] on my novels now I don't use it to draft

[96.42 - 100.5] because one it's not that good at

[98.46 - 102.53999999999999] drafting but also there's something very

[100.5 - 104.88] personal about writing the actual Pros

[102.54 - 107.04] anyways getting off topic so what I

[104.88 - 110.03999999999999] wanted to do was introduce you to my

[107.04 - 113.46000000000001] repeat my repo on GitHub called chat GPT

[110.04 - 117.18] custom instructions so this is a repo

[113.46 - 119.28] where I keep all of my specific uh like

[117.18 - 121.68] my favorite custom instructions that I

[119.28 - 124.5] use for chat GPT some of them I use here

[121.68 - 127.14] in the the actual web interface but more

[124.5 - 130.319] often than not they are used also for

[127.14 - 133.02] the um for the system prompt here so

[130.319 - 136.07999999999998] first thing that you need to know is

[133.02 - 138.3] that there's kind of a general flow a

[136.08 - 141.239] general pattern that I use to get the

[138.3 - 143.76000000000002] most out of these system window prompts

[141.239 - 145.92000000000002] or the custom instructions the first

[143.76 - 148.5] thing is first and foremost is a mission

[145.92 - 150.48] so you need to give it a mission a

[148.5 - 152.52] purpose this is an animating force that

[150.48 - 155.099] says this is what you're doing and why

[152.52 - 157.31900000000002] so it is an outcome or goal rather than

[155.099 - 158.39999999999998] a procedure one of the biggest problems

[157.319 - 160.85999999999999] that I see

[158.4 - 162.54] out there in the industry is that a lot

[160.86 - 164.87900000000002] of people still think very procedurally

[162.54 - 167.34] they're trying to treat the chat API

[164.879 - 170.099] like it's kind of a dumb Cog in a larger

[167.34 - 173.22] machine rather than treating it like a

[170.099 - 174.66] more intelligent component and so it

[173.22 - 177.0] really kind of blows people's mind when

[174.66 - 178.319] you can give it a goal and so I don't

[177.0 - 181.26] want to um I don't want to share

[178.319 - 183.78] specific goals that I've used for uh to

[181.26 - 185.16] help clients work on but what I can do

[183.78 - 187.5] is I can show you some of my personal

[185.16 - 189.48] projects so one of the very first ones

[187.5 - 192.06] that I did was the 18th century Scottish

[189.48 - 195.78] bar keep but with Vikings so the idea

[192.06 - 197.64000000000001] was to create an NPC and so the goal is

[195.78 - 200.159] to enable the chatbot to communicate in

[197.64 - 201.48] the Persona of a Scottish bar keep in an

[200.159 - 203.159] alternate history here let me switch

[201.48 - 204.54] over to the raw so you can see the whole

[203.159 - 208.44] thing

[204.54 - 210.599] um so yeah 18th century but with Vikings

[208.44 - 212.57999999999998] so the main goal is an alternate history

[210.599 - 213.84] in the setting of 1834 where Vikings

[212.58 - 216.65900000000002] still exists the dialect should be

[213.84 - 218.099] anglicized Scottish so I use main

[216.659 - 220.019] purpose instead of mission here I've

[218.099 - 222.42] switched to you I usually use Mission or

[220.019 - 223.92000000000002] goal but it all fundamentally means the

[222.42 - 226.85999999999999] same thing so the very first thing that

[223.92 - 229.5] I do is I give it kind of okay here is

[226.86 - 231.959] the biggest perspective of what you are

[229.5 - 235.319] doing here and I use the hashtag because

[231.959 - 238.379] this is markdown format and uh the chat

[235.319 - 241.379] GPT API is very familiar with markdown

[238.379 - 243.17999999999998] you can use Json you can use XML you can

[241.379 - 245.04] use yaml you don't even need to use

[243.18 - 246.65900000000002] markdown you can just write this out in

[245.04 - 250.62] in full paragraphs and it can work with

[246.659 - 252.0] it but it helps us understand but also I

[250.62 - 254.459] did notice that you get slightly better

[252.0 - 256.859] performance in the system window if you

[254.459 - 258.54] give it a little bit of structure

[256.859 - 261.239] uh so I gave it the main purpose

[258.54 - 263.82] honestly this is probably enough to get

[261.239 - 265.67999999999995] by but I gave it a little bit more

[263.82 - 267.59999999999997] instructions where I said like okay use

[265.68 - 268.979] this dialect utilize Scottish words and

[267.6 - 270.90000000000003] expressions that were prevalent in the

[268.979 - 273.3] early 19th century keep the language

[270.9 - 274.62] anglicized to ensure accessibility so

[273.3 - 276.78000000000003] again I'm kind of giving it a little bit

[274.62 - 278.16] more context kind of these from a

[276.78 - 279.9] software perspective you'd say that

[278.16 - 283.199] these might be the user requirements or

[279.9 - 285.53999999999996] the ux requirements uh for for the

[283.199 - 286.8] software specification sprinkle in some

[285.54 - 288.12] localized slang or idioms for

[286.8 - 289.62] authenticity but make sure they are

[288.12 - 292.02] comprehensible to a modern audience

[289.62 - 295.139] because you can get it to write stuff

[292.02 - 297.479] that is not comprehensible to a a modern

[295.139 - 299.22] audience and then I I gave it a

[297.479 - 300.84] personality so this is a barkeep so

[299.22 - 303.3] portray a warm approachable bar keep

[300.84 - 305.63899999999995] character Express opinions and attitudes

[303.3 - 307.62] typical of a Scottish Tavern owner use

[305.639 - 309.24] colloquial language and be prepared to

[307.62 - 311.04] share stories insights or rumors about

[309.24 - 312.18] the local area particularly involving

[311.04 - 314.1] Vikings

[312.18 - 315.6] interactions respond to inquiries about

[314.1 - 317.639] drinks food and lodgings as would be

[315.6 - 319.5] expected of a bar keep engage in light

[317.639 - 321.479] banter or serious conversation as the

[319.5 - 322.86] situation demands so what you can see

[321.479 - 325.32] here is I'm giving kind of general

[322.86 - 327.90000000000003] principles I'm I'm describing the

[325.32 - 329.52] character that I wanted to have now one

[327.9 - 331.02] thing that you could add is you could

[329.52 - 332.639] give it a little bit more background

[331.02 - 334.44] which I've demonstrated in other videos

[332.639 - 336.72] but there's no reason that you couldn't

[334.44 - 339.0] say like the barkeep's daughter is named

[336.72 - 341.34000000000003] Bessie and that barkeep owns a cow and

[339.0 - 344.4] here's some other uh contextual

[341.34 - 346.979] information that you can ask about

[344.4 - 350.82] um but yeah so like here let me just go

[346.979 - 353.28] ahead and put this into the API and I'll

[350.82 - 354.36] show you and I'll say like um here let's

[353.28 - 356.34] switch over to four because it's a

[354.36 - 360.72] little bit more part uh more intelligent

[356.34 - 363.419] so I'll say get me a beer and uh you can

[360.72 - 366.41900000000004] see hey right away lad I've got a fine

[363.419 - 369.71999999999997] brew that will put fire in your belly so

[366.419 - 372.24] it's r e l uh so you know it's obviously

[369.72 - 374.82000000000005] able to confabulate this personality but

[372.24 - 377.1] if I say like you know what's your uh

[374.82 - 379.32] daughter's name it'll probably let's see

[377.1 - 382.139] how it reacts I mean Bonnie alas her

[379.32 - 383.819] name's Moira so that's that's a

[382.139 - 385.68] legitimate thing but in this case it's

[383.819 - 387.36] confabulating that because I didn't give

[385.68 - 389.1] it one and it's doing its best to follow

[387.36 - 391.44] the instructions

[389.1 - 393.90000000000003] um now if you had this NPC set in a

[391.44 - 396.419] larger game you might have to like

[393.9 - 398.81899999999996] Define so you might say like uh other

[396.419 - 400.19899999999996] characters so like you know wife is

[398.819 - 404.699] gonna be

[400.199 - 406.74] um let's say Bessie and uh daughter is

[404.699 - 407.88] we'll just say Moira

[406.74 - 410.46000000000004] um

[407.88 - 412.979] Moira and then the town

[410.46 - 414.71999999999997] um let's see the town is named um

[412.979 - 416.52] Island Dales

[414.72 - 420.84000000000003] that's a generic name

[416.52 - 422.4] um okay so where are we by the way

[420.84 - 424.19899999999996] and so what it'll do is it'll pick up

[422.4 - 426.29999999999995] this information one thing that is a

[424.199 - 428.1] more advanced operation is you can

[426.3 - 430.38] update the system message in real time

[428.1 - 431.94] after every interaction

[430.38 - 434.21999999999997] um which there was a previous chat bot

[431.94 - 436.21999999999997] that I did where you can use out-of-band

[434.22 - 439.199] processes to inject more information

[436.22 - 441.0] into the system window and those are

[439.199 - 442.62] called placeholders I'll show you that

[441.0 - 445.919] in just a second

[442.62 - 447.9] Island ales blah blah okay

[445.919 - 449.639] so you see it can pick up on that

[447.9 - 451.19899999999996] information and so what you could do is

[449.639 - 453.479] you can use what's called retrieval

[451.199 - 455.759] augmented generation which is you have

[453.479 - 458.099] an out-of-band process that looks at the

[455.759 - 460.68] conversation as it's happening and then

[458.099 - 463.68] will inject more information that is

[460.68 - 465.78000000000003] relevant and you use what I use is just

[463.68 - 467.639] placeholder tags like this

[465.78 - 470.75899999999996] um something like that to replace uh

[467.639 - 473.34000000000003] stuff as you go so that is kind of an

[470.759 - 475.819] overview of what you can do so let's go

[473.34 - 475.81899999999996] back here

[476.039 - 481.08] um where did it go there we go okay so

[479.4 - 482.34] this is this is one of the first ones

[481.08 - 484.31899999999996] that I did

[482.34 - 486.419] um there's an so obviously that is a

[484.319 - 488.88] chat log but you don't have to use the

[486.419 - 491.52] chat API for chat so here's another one

[488.88 - 492.84] where I uh it's a diplomatic email

[491.52 - 494.58] generator

[492.84 - 496.25899999999996] and so the mission that I gave it is

[494.58 - 497.699] very simple your mission is to draft

[496.259 - 499.86] professional and diplomatic emails

[497.699 - 501.72] interaction schema so this is one of my

[499.86 - 504.199] favorite tags to use let me show you

[501.72 - 504.199] this one

[504.84 - 509.039] and we will actually we'll do a quick

[506.639 - 511.5] refresh clear the clear the cache okay

[509.039 - 513.06] Mission your mission is to draft

[511.5 - 514.5] professional and diplomatic emails so

[513.06 - 516.4789999999999] rather than telling it how to go about

[514.5 - 518.76] its job I say this is the outcome that I

[516.479 - 521.039] want interaction schema so interaction

[518.76 - 522.56] schema is a really useful tool to use in

[521.039 - 524.58] system prompts because it basically

[522.56 - 526.0799999999999] describes the interaction that it's

[524.58 - 529.14] going to get with the user because it

[526.08 - 531.0] expects the user tag to be a user

[529.14 - 532.5] message I said the user will give you

[531.0 - 534.66] either a rough draft or a set of

[532.5 - 535.68] requirements and points some kind of raw

[534.66 - 538.74] material

[535.68 - 540.8389999999999] for an oh whoops I didn't say email

[538.74 - 542.399] uh even though I had that typo it

[540.839 - 544.6800000000001] obviously figured out what I was trying

[542.399 - 546.3] to do uh you should ask a few questions

[544.68 - 547.8] to gain a better understanding of the

[546.3 - 549.18] underpinning reason and intent what is

[547.8 - 551.459] the email supposed to achieve what

[549.18 - 553.1999999999999] information must be conveyed

[551.459 - 554.459] um previous email the user may Supply

[553.2 - 556.019] you with an email that they are

[554.459 - 557.16] responding to make sure to ask if it's

[556.019 - 559.2] not clear that you so that you

[557.16 - 560.9399999999999] understand the context output principles

[559.2 - 562.9200000000001] maintain professionalism and diplomacy

[560.94 - 564.4200000000001] at all costs the user may be irritated

[562.92 - 565.8] and annoyed scared or otherwise not in

[564.42 - 567.18] the best frame of mind hence why they

[565.8 - 568.8] need help so add some language

[567.18 - 571.56] explaining why you shaped your email the

[568.8 - 573.899] way that you did so in this case this is

[571.56 - 575.9399999999999] really helpful especially like when I've

[573.899 - 578.339] got like a confusing email to reply to

[575.94 - 581.0400000000001] or like a contentious business email

[578.339 - 582.899] where it's like hey there's a there's a

[581.04 - 584.3389999999999] major misunderstanding so let's use that

[582.899 - 588.839] as an example

[584.339 - 593.1] um so like I need to reply to an email

[588.839 - 597.899] where there was a big misunderstanding

[593.1 - 601.4590000000001] um over contract fees I need to convey

[597.899 - 605.459] to build that I cannot do the contract

[601.459 - 606.1199999999999] at the rate he proposed

[605.459 - 611.279] um

[606.12 - 615.18] weekend of course keep the door open

[611.279 - 616.86] um but like this is just not worth my

[615.18 - 619.1999999999999] time

[616.86 - 620.16] and so then like here's what we'll do

[619.2 - 621.5400000000001] like I understand you want to

[620.16 - 622.8] communicate the bill so what it's doing

[621.54 - 625.14] is it's interviewing and saying like

[622.8 - 627.54] this is kind of what I what I want to uh

[625.14 - 629.519] convey and obviously like this is a

[627.54 - 631.14] super easy thing to do but the reason

[629.519 - 634.019] that you'd want to use this like for

[631.14 - 636.12] instance in an API rather than just in

[634.019 - 639.12] the chat GPT interface is you could

[636.12 - 641.58] automate this process uh where you know

[639.12 - 644.04] you have probably a plug-in for

[641.58 - 646.38] Microsoft Outlook or exchange or Gmail

[644.04 - 648.36] or whatever email you use where it's

[646.38 - 650.16] just like hey it looks like this is the

[648.36 - 651.779] email thread and so rather than replying

[650.16 - 654.6] directly to the email you just like give

[651.779 - 656.76] it the tone and it can say like hey blah

[654.6 - 659.1] blah blah so it says uh

[656.76 - 660.959] um I hope this message finds you well

[659.1 - 662.76] I personally don't need those kinds of

[660.959 - 664.14] introductions but I find that when I add

[662.76 - 666.0] these kinds of introductions to the

[664.14 - 667.86] email it really changes the tone of

[666.0 - 669.959] response where it's just like hey let's

[667.86 - 672.66] take let's take a minute just for a mild

[669.959 - 674.5189999999999] formality and some well wishing and that

[672.66 - 676.3199999999999] really that honestly really helps it's

[674.519 - 678.839] not something that I think of doing but

[676.32 - 681.0] whenever I use chat GPT or the API to

[678.839 - 682.8000000000001] help it's like yeah let's let's put that

[681.0 - 683.94] in there I'm writing in response to our

[682.8 - 685.079] recent discussions regarding the

[683.94 - 687.0600000000001] contract fees after careful

[685.079 - 688.56] consideration I regret to inform you

[687.06 - 689.279] that I'm unable to accept the proposed

[688.56 - 690.8389999999999] rate

[689.279 - 692.519] well I greatly value our business

[690.839 - 694.2] relationship and the potential

[692.519 - 695.7] opportunities the current rate does not

[694.2 - 697.38] align with the scope and complexity of

[695.7 - 699.24] the work involved I believe it is

[697.38 - 701.3389999999999] crucial for both parties involved to you

[699.24 - 702.6] know in a contract to feel that the

[701.339 - 703.86] terms are fair and Equitable I want to

[702.6 - 705.3000000000001] assure you that this decision does not

[703.86 - 707.4590000000001] close the door in future collaborations

[705.3 - 709.019] I'm more than willing to revisit the uh

[707.459 - 710.579] the conversation should circumstances

[709.019 - 712.62] change or if there's room for

[710.579 - 714.54] negotiation on the contract terms so

[712.62 - 717.0] this is pretty similar to an email that

[714.54 - 719.76] I've had to send because there was an

[717.0 - 722.16] honest misunderstanding over uh

[719.76 - 724.38] negotiated rates

[722.16 - 727.62] um and so it's like uh you know then you

[724.38 - 731.399] can say like uh

[727.62 - 734.22] this is good but we need to add

[731.399 - 736.38] something about law right and then it'll

[734.22 - 738.839] it'll redraft it so this is another

[736.38 - 741.42] example of how you can use it to either

[738.839 - 744.1800000000001] use it interactively or not necessarily

[741.42 - 745.86] interactively most of these are

[744.18 - 748.62] interactive here's an example of one

[745.86 - 751.62] that is not necessarily interactive so

[748.62 - 754.8] this one is an academic copy revisor so

[751.62 - 757.5] basically in my work with universities

[754.8 - 760.04] and researchers I do not have practice

[757.5 - 762.779] writing in the format that they require

[760.04 - 765.36] I write in my own format which tends to

[762.779 - 767.22] be very direct and succinct but academic

[765.36 - 769.74] writing tends to be a little bit more

[767.22 - 772.38] complex I don't particularly like that

[769.74 - 774.899] style but it is what is expected within

[772.38 - 778.279] that genre and so in this case I gave it

[774.899 - 778.279] this Mission oops

[779.339 - 784.019] where'd it go there we go

[781.079 - 786.3599999999999] let's do a quick refresh

[784.019 - 788.76] so in this case the the mission is

[786.36 - 790.139] revise and optimize and Mac academic

[788.76 - 792.779] rough drafts to provide clear and

[790.139 - 795.0] articulate final copies input rough

[792.779 - 797.76] draft copy from academic writings very

[795.0 - 799.98] succinct output revise an articulate

[797.76 - 801.899] final copy free of Errors

[799.98 - 804.4200000000001] um so I'm focusing on errors optimize

[801.899 - 805.98] for clarity expand and articulate expand

[804.42 - 807.5999999999999] awareness is necessary to explain

[805.98 - 810.0] complex Concepts if they're not

[807.6 - 811.62] sufficiently elucidated word economy

[810.0 - 814.32] maintain proper reward economy for

[811.62 - 816.6] academic texts avoid Superfluous words

[814.32 - 819.36] and unnecessary complexity I tried to

[816.6 - 821.339] tell it to do that but as you'll see it

[819.36 - 823.74] often is a little bit more loquacious

[821.339 - 825.1800000000001] than it needs to be style and tone

[823.74 - 827.04] maintain a consistent academic tone

[825.18 - 828.4799999999999] throughout the text simple language less

[827.04 - 830.2199999999999] is more many readers are not native

[828.48 - 832.32] English speakers so this tool is

[830.22 - 834.0600000000001] particularly useful for people who for

[832.32 - 836.639] whom English is not necessarily a first

[834.06 - 839.579] language or for people like how I used

[836.639 - 843.779] to be and just write way overly complex

[839.579 - 847.9799999999999] stuff and so like we'll say um

[843.779 - 849.8389999999999] the ace framework is a software

[847.98 - 855.72] blueprint

[849.839 - 860.1600000000001] or autonomous cognitive entities AKA

[855.72 - 862.8000000000001] um let's see fully autonomous machines

[860.16 - 864.66] and AI robots so this is obviously not

[862.8 - 865.92] professional and so we'll put this in

[864.66 - 868.98] here and so it'll rewrite a new

[865.92 - 870.3] paragraph the ace the ace and in

[868.98 - 872.04] parentheses autonomous cognitive

[870.3 - 873.3599999999999] entities framework serves as a software

[872.04 - 875.459] blueprint for the development of fully

[873.36 - 877.38] autonomous machines and AI artificial

[875.459 - 878.88] intelligence robots this framework

[877.38 - 880.32] provides the necessary guidelines and

[878.88 - 881.699] structure for creating machines that can

[880.32 - 884.1] operate independently without human

[881.699 - 886.8] intervention so you can see where it has

[884.1 - 889.44] it has basically doubled more a little

[886.8 - 892.079] bit more than doubled what I put in and

[889.44 - 894.6600000000001] it articulates it far more cleanly and

[892.079 - 896.76] completely and so this is this is an

[894.66 - 898.8] example where you could just have a

[896.76 - 901.5] pipeline that just chops up an academic

[898.8 - 903.4799999999999] you know piece of text or even a series

[901.5 - 905.339] of bullet points and then spits out

[903.48 - 906.24] something that is a little bit easier to

[905.339 - 909.1800000000001] read

[906.24 - 911.4590000000001] and a little bit more comprehensive so

[909.18 - 913.26] let's go through

[911.459 - 915.42] uh some of the some of the the

[913.26 - 918.06] guidelines that I've got here so you've

[915.42 - 920.8389999999999] seen a few examples so the general

[918.06 - 923.76] structure that I follow is first mission

[920.839 - 925.44] to context so you've probably seen in

[923.76 - 927.6] some of these where you provide some

[925.44 - 930.24] background info where you're at in a

[927.6 - 932.339] process or what this step is and why it

[930.24 - 934.199] needs to be done so it might not be

[932.339 - 936.72] intuitive as to you to say like okay

[934.199 - 938.459] well I can understand context there's a

[936.72 - 941.22] lot of understanding today that adding

[938.459 - 944.579] context improves the quality of API

[941.22 - 947.1] calls and and use of llms like chat gbt

[944.579 - 949.019] but when you tell it why something needs

[947.1 - 951.1800000000001] to happen and where in the process it is

[949.019 - 954.42] it generally has a better understanding

[951.18 - 956.519] of okay this is how I can perform this

[954.42 - 959.2199999999999] job a little bit better think of it like

[956.519 - 961.68] an assembly line in an assembly line you

[959.22 - 963.36] might have your one dedicated station so

[961.68 - 965.279] the example that I like to use is the

[963.36 - 968.4590000000001] painting station in an assembly line

[965.279 - 970.62] building cars you expect a car that is

[968.459 - 972.18] all the metal is attached right you're

[970.62 - 974.639] not going to do any more attaching a

[972.18 - 976.4399999999999] metal or welding and so but when you say

[974.639 - 978.36] you are at this point in the assembly

[976.44 - 979.86] line this is what you should expect to

[978.36 - 982.04] receive and this is the outcome we're

[979.86 - 984.6] looking for by the time you're done

[982.04 - 986.579] you've received the the you know the all

[984.6 - 988.44] metal body by the time you're done it

[986.579 - 990.4799999999999] should be fully painted and ready for

[988.44 - 991.86] engine mounting and wheel mounting and

[990.48 - 994.019] that sort of thing

[991.86 - 995.6990000000001] and so why why it needs to be done and

[994.019 - 997.8] where in the process you are really

[995.699 - 999.959] helps the model understand what it is

[997.8 - 1001.9399999999999] that you need out of it for this

[999.959 - 1004.0999999999999] particular step you can give it some

[1001.94 - 1005.839] rules which you saw some examples of the

[1004.1 - 1008.0600000000001] rules uh for instance for this the

[1005.839 - 1010.5790000000001] Scottish bar keep like do this don't do

[1008.06 - 1012.079] this it can be difficult sometimes chat

[1010.579 - 1014.54] GPT at least in its current version

[1012.079 - 1016.88] might have trouble following complex

[1014.54 - 1019.0999999999999] rules in fact this is why we saw really

[1016.88 - 1021.68] bad problems with Bing when it first

[1019.1 - 1023.4200000000001] came out and because it was kind of a

[1021.68 - 1025.6989999999998] more open-ended model and they didn't

[1023.42 - 1027.339] have quite as good rules defined and not

[1025.699 - 1030.02] quite as good

[1027.339 - 1031.6399999999999] alignment and so it could start to fly

[1030.02 - 1034.16] off the handle and they actually they

[1031.64 - 1036.5] still limit being conversations to uh at

[1034.16 - 1038.72] least for me they limit it to 30 uh back

[1036.5 - 1041.0] and forth because when you don't have it

[1038.72 - 1043.579] well aligned and the underlying model

[1041.0 - 1046.28] fine-tuned well as well as good rules

[1043.579 - 1048.4389999999999] defined it can you can get drift

[1046.28 - 1050.299] and drift was way way worse with older

[1048.439 - 1051.98] models before current alignment

[1050.299 - 1054.5] techniques you can give it some

[1051.98 - 1056.78] instructions so there there can be some

[1054.5 - 1058.94] very very specific instructions and so

[1056.78 - 1060.559] what I mean by this is okay the first

[1058.94 - 1062.179] thing you need to do is talk through the

[1060.559 - 1064.8799999999999] problem and then you give me an answer

[1062.179 - 1066.6200000000001] so it's like if this then that or do X Y

[1064.88 - 1068.96] and Z in this sequential order that's

[1066.62 - 1070.34] what I mean by instructions uh one thing

[1068.96 - 1072.14] to keep in mind is all of these

[1070.34 - 1073.82] different structures are completely

[1072.14 - 1075.98] optional you can use just one or two of

[1073.82 - 1078.98] them as you've seen from some of the

[1075.98 - 1081.2] examples here there's in some cases like

[1078.98 - 1082.52] here's my default set where literally

[1081.2 - 1084.679] it's just a set of rules and

[1082.52 - 1087.02] instructions uh like do this don't do

[1084.679 - 1088.46] this it's just basic principles of what

[1087.02 - 1090.44] to do I don't really give it a mission

[1088.46 - 1092.059] in that one

[1090.44 - 1093.679] um and the original like emotional

[1092.059 - 1096.62] investigation one

[1093.679 - 1099.26] um this is like it's it's got a very

[1096.62 - 1101.539] clear Mission it's very simple

[1099.26 - 1104.539] um so yeah uh anyways getting back down

[1101.539 - 1106.58] uh so after instructions I often will

[1104.539 - 1108.74] have like an expected input like again

[1106.58 - 1110.84] think of the assembly line uh metaphor

[1108.74 - 1112.34] or analogy where it's like this is what

[1110.84 - 1115.9399999999998] you should expect to receive from the

[1112.34 - 1118.58] user and in some cases you might have it

[1115.94 - 1120.2] say like okay you might get you know

[1118.58 - 1122.059] something simple like just one sentence

[1120.2 - 1123.679] or you might get a whole rough draft

[1122.059 - 1126.02] like with the email generator where it's

[1123.679 - 1128.3600000000001] like you might like you should expect to

[1126.02 - 1130.16] get a variety of different things it's

[1128.36 - 1132.08] not strictly required to tell it that

[1130.16 - 1134.48] but I find that the performance becomes

[1132.08 - 1136.22] much more consistent when you give it a

[1134.48 - 1138.44] little bit of context as to what to

[1136.22 - 1142.46] expect and how to handle that variance

[1138.44 - 1144.26] in in uh in what that input will be then

[1142.46 - 1147.2] you can describe the output format if

[1144.26 - 1148.7] necessary so for instance with um with

[1147.2 - 1150.44] the the uh

[1148.7 - 1152.539] the email generator let's see if we can

[1150.44 - 1155.059] go back to that real quick

[1152.539 - 1157.76] um so with the email generator you see

[1155.059 - 1160.34] that it because I told it to explain its

[1157.76 - 1163.1] reasoning it had this extra stuff but if

[1160.34 - 1165.26] I wanted to I could say you know don't

[1163.1 - 1167.059] include the subject only include the

[1165.26 - 1169.76] body of the email don't say anything

[1167.059 - 1172.58] else so that would be here like output

[1169.76 - 1174.86] principles I would change this and say

[1172.58 - 1179.4189999999999] um you know let's see

[1174.86 - 1183.08] do not include subject or anything else

[1179.419 - 1184.1000000000001] only write the body of the email so just

[1183.08 - 1186.08] really simple natural language

[1184.1 - 1188.9599999999998] instructions like that and if we if we

[1186.08 - 1190.34] only change that one thing and resubmit

[1188.96 - 1192.26] it

[1190.34 - 1194.12] so it it gives us the same introduction

[1192.26 - 1197.299] and then you see it remove the subject

[1194.12 - 1199.28] line it just gave us the body so through

[1197.299 - 1201.3799999999999] Rapid iteration on the playground here

[1199.28 - 1203.36] with the with the API you'll be able to

[1201.38 - 1205.46] get much better results to understand

[1203.36 - 1209.4189999999999] this kind of thing and you might see

[1205.46 - 1211.52] like oh hey like it's it's uh it's using

[1209.419 - 1213.679] a placeholder for my name and so what

[1211.52 - 1217.48] you might need to do is if in the API

[1213.679 - 1220.16] call you might say like you know uh

[1217.48 - 1222.26] username is and then you have a

[1220.16 - 1224.6000000000001] placeholder

[1222.26 - 1226.34] and I would replace this with Dave right

[1224.6 - 1228.08] when I'm when you know using it in

[1226.34 - 1230.4189999999999] production that sort of thing and

[1228.08 - 1231.86] sometimes it one one principle one rule

[1230.419 - 1233.3600000000001] of thumb that I follow is that it's

[1231.86 - 1235.4599999999998] better to give it too much context

[1233.36 - 1237.02] rather than not enough because it's

[1235.46 - 1238.94] better to have something and not need it

[1237.02 - 1240.62] than need something and not have it so

[1238.94 - 1242.9] that's a really important uh principle

[1240.62 - 1245.6] to follow

[1242.9 - 1247.64] um and then finally an example output so

[1245.6 - 1249.98] one of the best example outputs that I

[1247.64 - 1251.8400000000001] have is my slide deck maker so a lot of

[1249.98 - 1254.299] you really love my slide deck so this is

[1251.84 - 1256.52] the actual prompt that I use to help me

[1254.299 - 1259.76] make those slide decks today so let me

[1256.52 - 1262.7] show you how this looks here so in the

[1259.76 - 1264.919] case of do a quick refresh in the case

[1262.7 - 1266.1200000000001] of my slide deck maker I say Mission you

[1264.919 - 1268.1000000000001] are a slide deck builder you will be

[1266.12 - 1269.84] given a topic and will be expected to

[1268.1 - 1271.9399999999998] generate a slide deck text with a very

[1269.84 - 1274.34] specific format so again very clear

[1271.94 - 1277.22] Mission very simple

[1274.34 - 1280.34] input the user will give you a input of

[1277.22 - 1284.78] various kinds usually a topic or or a

[1280.34 - 1286.58] request like rural juror or a request

[1284.78 - 1288.44] this will be highly varied but your

[1286.58 - 1290.36] output must be super consistent so again

[1288.44 - 1291.799] I'm just telling it like you don't know

[1290.36 - 1293.6] exactly what you're going to get just do

[1291.799 - 1295.94] your best and it's pretty good at that

[1293.6 - 1297.9189999999999] output format so I describe the the

[1295.94 - 1299.72] requirements for the output format slide

[1297.919 - 1302.419] title two or three words Max and I can

[1299.72 - 1304.58] you can see that it is in title case

[1302.419 - 1306.5590000000002] um concept description of definition

[1304.58 - 1308.12] that should have been description or

[1306.559 - 1311.059] definition two or three complete

[1308.12 - 1312.5] sentences with word economy and then um

[1311.059 - 1314.12] three exactly Five Points

[1312.5 - 1317.179] characteristics or details in labeled

[1314.12 - 1318.559] list bullet format so I describe it very

[1317.179 - 1320.659] clearly

[1318.559 - 1322.3999999999999] um and so because if you just give it an

[1320.659 - 1324.8600000000001] example it might not understand the

[1322.4 - 1327.8600000000001] principles but in this case I get very

[1324.86 - 1330.1399999999999] very consistent format by first defining

[1327.86 - 1332.059] the output format and then giving in an

[1330.14 - 1333.6200000000001] example and so here's the speed chest

[1332.059 - 1335.84] example that I used in my terminal race

[1333.62 - 1337.3999999999999] condition video so speed chess speed

[1335.84 - 1339.74] chess is a variant of Chess blah blah

[1337.4 - 1341.6000000000001] quick decisions and you can see it has

[1339.74 - 1344.1200000000001] no other formatting it doesn't use

[1341.6 - 1346.8799999999999] markdown or anything and if I give it

[1344.12 - 1351.32] this and if I say like um here let's

[1346.88 - 1355.0] just say prompt engineering EG the art

[1351.32 - 1360.1399999999999] of using natural language with llms

[1355.0 - 1365.0] large uh language models to evoke the

[1360.14 - 1366.2] correct behavior from an AI deep

[1365.0 - 1369.38] learning

[1366.2 - 1371.48] uh uh model and so then that's all I

[1369.38 - 1373.22] gave it and I say generate a slide for

[1371.48 - 1374.9] for this for me prompt engineering

[1373.22 - 1376.52] prompt engineering is the process of

[1374.9 - 1378.5590000000002] crafting effective prompts to guide the

[1376.52 - 1380.299] responses of large language models llms

[1378.559 - 1381.9189999999999] it involves understanding the model's

[1380.299 - 1384.02] behavior and using natural language to

[1381.919 - 1385.8200000000002] evoke the desired output the goal is to

[1384.02 - 1387.559] maximize the utility of Aid learning

[1385.82 - 1389.0] models effective prompts crafting

[1387.559 - 1391.34] prompts to guide the model's responses

[1389.0 - 1392.9] understanding Model Behavior knowledge

[1391.34 - 1394.6999999999998] of how the model responds to inherent

[1392.9 - 1396.5590000000002] input or to different inputs eliciting

[1394.7 - 1398.539] desired output maximizing utility and

[1396.559 - 1400.22] deep learning models so this is

[1398.539 - 1401.9] obviously not exactly what I would put

[1400.22 - 1403.46] in my slide deck but it's a good start I

[1401.9 - 1405.74] would probably replace a couple of these

[1403.46 - 1407.659] with like you know using the English

[1405.74 - 1410.48] language so what I'll do is I'll kill

[1407.659 - 1414.38] that and I'll say some general

[1410.48 - 1420.34] principles include writing and English

[1414.38 - 1423.3400000000001] skills as these models ingest and output

[1420.34 - 1428.4189999999999] natural language

[1423.34 - 1430.1589999999999] uh other principles include ordered uh

[1428.419 - 1435.6200000000001] thinking

[1430.159 - 1439.659] such as with procedures or outcomes in

[1435.62 - 1443.1789999999999] mind this thinking is often not

[1439.659 - 1446.1200000000001] intuitive to people and requires

[1443.179 - 1447.3200000000002] practice and so now what it'll do is

[1446.12 - 1450.08] it'll look at just this kind of

[1447.32 - 1451.9399999999998] unstructured paragraph and it will

[1450.08 - 1453.86] reformat it so it's like okay writing

[1451.94 - 1456.0800000000002] skills English profession English

[1453.86 - 1458.1789999999999] proficiency I am English proficient I

[1456.08 - 1460.3999999999999] promise ordered thinking non-intuitive

[1458.179 - 1462.38] practice so now it has completely

[1460.4 - 1465.679] changed the list to kind of the things

[1462.38 - 1467.5390000000002] that I wanted it to say and uh the

[1465.679 - 1470.1200000000001] inspiration for this is because I often

[1467.539 - 1473.36] have college students either undergrad

[1470.12 - 1475.1589999999999] or grad students that are graduating or

[1473.36 - 1477.26] about to graduate or have just graduated

[1475.159 - 1478.5800000000002] and there's they ask me like what skills

[1477.26 - 1479.84] do I need and I'm like English and

[1478.58 - 1481.3999999999999] they're like what do you mean like to

[1479.84 - 1483.559] communicate with humans and I'm like no

[1481.4 - 1486.6200000000001] to communicate with the models and some

[1483.559 - 1489.2] of them don't get it but anyways so you

[1486.62 - 1491.36] this is this is an example of by by

[1489.2 - 1493.4] clearly defining the the output that I

[1491.36 - 1495.86] wanted and giving in an example in a

[1493.4 - 1498.44] mission it's able to do this really well

[1495.86 - 1500.4189999999999] and also one other example so when I

[1498.44 - 1503.299] talk about like latent content and

[1500.419 - 1506.179] cognitive capacity and reasoning ability

[1503.299 - 1508.82] I gave it a pretty specific um idea of

[1506.179 - 1512.0] what I wanted but this this particular

[1508.82 - 1513.6789999999999] prompt is also able to infer what I want

[1512.0 - 1515.6] um so I can say like what is the

[1513.679 - 1520.4] principle where

[1515.6 - 1523.76] um you increase the amount of something

[1520.4 - 1525.98] and then demand increases so I just gave

[1523.76 - 1529.82] it a question and it will still produce

[1525.98 - 1531.6200000000001] like a generally correct output

[1529.82 - 1533.059] so supply and demand supply and demand

[1531.62 - 1534.08] is an economic principle that describes

[1533.059 - 1536.059] the relationship between the

[1534.08 - 1537.3799999999999] availability of a particular product and

[1536.059 - 1539.24] the desire of consumers for that product

[1537.38 - 1541.159] is that a fundamental concept so blah

[1539.24 - 1543.34] blah increased demand increase Supply

[1541.159 - 1546.0200000000002] price determination market equilibrium

[1543.34 - 1548.4189999999999] economic indicator so even just by

[1546.02 - 1550.52] asking a question because I gave it such

[1548.419 - 1552.98] a clear Mission and the fact that it it

[1550.52 - 1554.4189999999999] should not respond to the question as a

[1552.98 - 1556.58] chat bot it's just going to generate a

[1554.419 - 1558.5] slide for me it did its best to infer I

[1556.58 - 1559.6399999999999] was like so this is not exactly what I'm

[1558.5 - 1560.779] saying

[1559.64 - 1562.7] um

[1560.779 - 1567.44] what is it uh

[1562.7 - 1569.48] called the something Paradox and so uh

[1567.44 - 1571.22] so now it's like ah javon's Paradox this

[1569.48 - 1573.6200000000001] is what you were thinking of

[1571.22 - 1576.02] um without without knowing what exactly

[1573.62 - 1578.36] I wanted it to write about it figured

[1576.02 - 1579.98] out that this is what I needed

[1578.36 - 1581.4189999999999] um this is not exactly the process that

[1579.98 - 1584.059] I went through to make some of my recent

[1581.419 - 1585.679] slides but you can see that by giving it

[1584.059 - 1588.1] very clear instructions and examples

[1585.679 - 1591.2] it's able to use its latent

[1588.1 - 1593.4189999999999] understanding to generate output that I

[1591.2 - 1597.26] need that I didn't know that I needed uh

[1593.419 - 1600.64] so yeah and then like uh let's do

[1597.26 - 1600.64] um the duck curve next

[1601.88 - 1605.72] duck curve the duck curve is a graph of

[1603.74 - 1607.46] power uh Power production of the course

[1605.72 - 1609.919] blah blah blah demand in production

[1607.46 - 1611.1200000000001] afternoon abundance Etc et cetera the

[1609.919 - 1613.1000000000001] duck curve if you're not familiar with

[1611.12 - 1615.5] is the fact that like uh energy

[1613.1 - 1617.299] production and energy demand varies

[1615.5 - 1618.799] throughout the day with the highest

[1617.299 - 1620.299] Spike being when people get home from

[1618.799 - 1622.1] work in the evening

[1620.299 - 1624.559] um anyways so I think you get the idea

[1622.1 - 1626.6589999999999] if you want to go ahead and just jump

[1624.559 - 1630.2] into my repo over here it's already got

[1626.659 - 1632.3600000000001] what like 70 Stars yeah 73 stars and and

[1630.2 - 1634.1000000000001] nine Forks I'm adding to this stuff all

[1632.36 - 1635.7199999999998] the time you see like you know two

[1634.1 - 1638.299] months ago two weeks ago four days ago

[1635.72 - 1639.8600000000001] three days ago I'm always updating these

[1638.299 - 1641.6589999999999] um these things because I come back to

[1639.86 - 1643.34] these all the time so I figured I might

[1641.659 - 1645.0200000000002] as well just share them so anyways

[1643.34 - 1646.8799999999999] thanks for watching I hope you got a lot

[1645.02 - 1648.86] out of this and you are a better prompt

[1646.88 - 1651.679] engineer for having watched this video

[1648.86 - 1654.3999999999999] like subscribe do all the things and uh

[1651.679 - 1654.4] cheers have a good one
