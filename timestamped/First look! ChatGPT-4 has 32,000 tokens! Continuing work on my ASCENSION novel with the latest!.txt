[0.42 - 3.6] hey everyone David Shapiro here

[3.06 - 5.04] um

[3.6 - 8.76] who I don't know when I'm gonna post

[5.04 - 12.620000000000001] this video but gpt4 just dropped and um

[8.76 - 12.62] so I'm already experimenting with it

[12.84 - 19.32] um now the biggest thing that I noticed

[15.78 - 22.799999999999997] in the live stream demo was that the

[19.32 - 24.240000000000002] chat gpt4 has a token count of 32 000

[22.8 - 27.3] tokens

[24.24 - 29.4] and the ratio of tokens to words is

[27.3 - 30.48] roughly two-thirds so that's about 20

[29.4 - 34.739] 000 words

[30.48 - 37.44] twenty thousand words is a lot that is

[34.739 - 39.599999999999994] about a hundred Pages uh just shy of 100

[37.44 - 42.959999999999994] pages of text

[39.6 - 45.18] um which is enough working memory

[42.96 - 47.1] to do basically any human task almost

[45.18 - 48.6] any human task especially when you

[47.1 - 50.1] consider the amount of intrinsic

[48.6 - 52.82] knowledge or background knowledge or

[50.1 - 58.079] latent knowledge that the model has

[52.82 - 60.899] so we just hit a new era of AI so the

[58.079 - 64.619] the only way you can use gpt4 right now

[60.899 - 67.2] is if you're on chat GPT plus

[64.619 - 70.2] um and I already signed up for the API

[67.2 - 72.72] of course but it looks like it'll be a

[70.2 - 74.46000000000001] minute so anyways so I'm going back to

[72.72 - 76.2] Ascension so here's the notes that I had

[74.46 - 76.86] for Ascension

[76.2 - 80.22] um

[76.86 - 82.5] and then I also have the previous uh uh

[80.22 - 85.02] one right here

[82.5 - 87.299] um so what I'm doing is I'm adding in

[85.02 - 90.02] some of the information that I was

[87.299 - 93.18] brainstorming last time

[90.02 - 94.74] Okay so

[93.18 - 97.68] let's see what are the specific

[94.74 - 100.86] Milestones there we go all right so

[97.68 - 103.92] let me add some of these notes

[100.86 - 107.82] and we're just gonna we're just gonna go

[103.92 - 112.02] refresh Ascension part two uh great here

[107.82 - 115.27999999999999] are some other notes we worked on in

[112.02 - 115.28] another session

[117.72 - 123.03] um here actually let me

[119.34 - 123.60000000000001] just grab this as a whole

[123.03 - 125.6] [Music]

[123.6 - 125.6] um

[127.92 - 131.4] because the uh the context window is so

[130.619 - 135.12] long

[131.4 - 139.81900000000002] great here are some notes from

[135.12 - 139.81900000000002] another session we worked on

[141.0 - 145.56] um

[142.14 - 147.48] wait there's more are you ready

[145.56 - 149.459] so one thing I've noticed already is

[147.48 - 151.5] that gpt4 is a little bit more hot on

[149.459 - 153.959] the biscuit ready to go so you got to

[151.5 - 155.7] tell it like wait

[153.959 - 157.8] um

[155.7 - 160.73899999999998] of course I am here to help take your

[157.8 - 162.72] time okay blah blah blah I don't want to

[160.739 - 164.459] interrupt it so you'll notice that gpt4

[162.72 - 166.379] is a little bit slower

[164.459 - 168.0] so that's fine all right so then we'll

[166.379 - 172.92] come up here

[168.0 - 173.879] um let's see I just got uh this one

[172.92 - 178.01899999999998] um

[173.879 - 178.01899999999998] here are some possible milestones

[179.94 - 184.4] here actually let's just let's just grab

[182.04 - 184.4] all this

[185.7 - 188.17999999999998] great

[190.8 - 193.76000000000002] um actually no that's fine

[204.48 - 207.01899999999998] oops

[213.48 - 218.39999999999998] let me check if there's more so

[216.659 - 220.07999999999998] basically sorry for the silence I was

[218.4 - 220.739] just kind of thinking

[220.08 - 223.56] um

[220.739 - 225.299] so I'm giving it everything and this is

[223.56 - 230.34] let's just oops

[225.299 - 230.34] let's just copy paste everything

[230.459 - 234.72] into a new word document and see how

[232.56 - 238.31900000000002] many words this is

[234.72 - 242.28] so this is only 2300 words so this is

[238.319 - 244.61999999999998] about a tenth of the context window

[242.28 - 246.659] so we're we're already planning the

[244.62 - 247.62] entire story

[246.659 - 249.78] um

[247.62 - 251.22] basically copy pasting everything that

[249.78 - 255.48] I've already got

[251.22 - 258.12] let's see there it is okay

[255.48 - 259.38] there we go okay great so now that we've

[258.12 - 260.22] got this okay

[259.38 - 262.139] um

[260.22 - 265.5] I think

[262.139 - 269.88] that is the grand total of all the

[265.5 - 271.8] information we've got about story so far

[269.88 - 276.84] please

[271.8 - 278.96000000000004] um recap everything in totality

[276.84 - 278.96] um

[279.24 - 282.66] uh

[280.62 - 286.08] about this story

[282.66 - 289.259] please capture all details

[286.08 - 290.03999999999996] um in a complete report

[289.259 - 292.46000000000004] um

[290.04 - 294.68] I will be using

[292.46 - 299.34] this document

[294.68 - 300.90000000000003] to some uh uh let's see two uh what's

[299.34 - 302.82] the word um

[300.9 - 305.69899999999996] let's see as a

[302.82 - 308.94] as the main uh let's see there's a

[305.699 - 310.38] there's a term for it in in fiction

[308.94 - 311.46] um where you use it like it's your main

[310.38 - 313.32] Bible

[311.46 - 313.919] what's the main Bible for

[313.32 - 315.36] um

[313.919 - 317.21999999999997] story

[315.36 - 319.91900000000004] okay so while that's going let's talk

[317.22 - 322.08000000000004] about gbt4

[319.919 - 326.69899999999996] um so I watched the whole live stream

[322.08 - 328.68] gpt4 is multimodal it can accept images

[326.699 - 331.46000000000004] um if you look at

[328.68 - 331.46] product

[332.88 - 338.9] um they mention

[335.46 - 338.9] I think they mentioned videos

[339.66 - 345.84000000000003] um did they

[342.419 - 348.0] no okay so basically it has it can

[345.84 - 350.34] understand images which means that it

[348.0 - 352.139] can look at a screen right it can look

[350.34 - 354.11999999999995] at your code it can look at what you're

[352.139 - 356.1] doing and understand what it's doing so

[354.12 - 357.6] it's multimodal on the input I don't

[356.1 - 360.3] think it's multimodal on the output

[357.6 - 361.91900000000004] that's fine

[360.3 - 364.62] um and you can see okay here it is it's

[361.919 - 367.21999999999997] going a little bit slower

[364.62 - 367.22] um there we go

[368.039 - 373.199] um

[369.0 - 376.68] yeah but you know so in terms of the

[373.199 - 378.78000000000003] cognitive performance of gpt4 it looks

[376.68 - 382.56] like it's an incremental

[378.78 - 385.55999999999995] um improvement over GPT 3.5

[382.56 - 387.36] um so that is that is the that is like

[385.56 - 390.96] where we're starting

[387.36 - 394.38] um but on top of the incremental

[390.96 - 396.06] improvements there is uh there's this

[394.38 - 397.68] the cognitive Improvement and so if you

[396.06 - 398.22] look on this

[397.68 - 400.56] um

[398.22 - 402.3] it they talk about like how much it has

[400.56 - 405.12] improved on benchmarks

[402.3 - 407.16] so the uniform bar exam Chad gbt placed

[405.12 - 409.919] in the 10th percentile so it passed the

[407.16 - 412.08000000000004] bar gpt4 placed in the 90th percentile

[409.919 - 415.38] so that means that

[412.08 - 417.9] um gpt4 now outperforms 90 percent of

[415.38 - 421.86] lawyers on the bar exam

[417.9 - 423.71999999999997] and then the biology Olympiad it was in

[421.86 - 425.46000000000004] the 31st percentile now it is in the

[423.72 - 428.34000000000003] 99th percentile

[425.46 - 430.79999999999995] so uh

[428.34 - 433.85999999999996] to say that this is a Quantum Leap

[430.8 - 435.90000000000003] Forward is not an exaggeration so I just

[433.86 - 439.319] posted a um

[435.9 - 441.84] a uh uh a poll

[439.319 - 444.0] a couple days ago

[441.84 - 447.11999999999995] um I guess it was actually one day ago I

[444.0 - 452.28] I said will we achieve AGI this year and

[447.12 - 454.44] 20 19 say yes AGI this year 73 so almost

[452.28 - 456.84] three quarters of people say no AGI in

[454.44 - 459.71999999999997] the future and then um nine percent say

[456.84 - 461.75899999999996] AGI already happened I suspect this is

[459.72 - 465.62] going to change after people see what

[461.759 - 465.62] what gpt4 is capable of

[465.78 - 473.78] okay cool

[468.479 - 473.78] um disentangling from Power there we go

[474.3 - 477.44] Moment of Truth

[478.02 - 480.56] great

[481.86 - 485.88] um okay this is not quite as detailed as

[484.259 - 487.91900000000004] I had hoped but that's okay because all

[485.88 - 492.3] the information is here

[487.919 - 493.979] um let's see you seem to be missing Act

[492.3 - 496.02000000000004] One

[493.979 - 499.039] um plot Beats

[496.02 - 499.039] so let's see what it says

[502.08 - 507.31899999999996] okay so

[505.259 - 507.319] um

[508.139 - 514.32] I was just talking to my fiance about

[510.08 - 517.4399999999999] the scale of 32 of a 32 000 token memory

[514.32 - 519.0] so that's about 20 000 Words which when

[517.44 - 520.5600000000001] you combine that twenty thousand words

[519.0 - 522.18] with the intrinsic knowledge that the

[520.56 - 523.38] model already has so that means that you

[522.18 - 526.3199999999999] only need to give it the relevant

[523.38 - 528.6] updated details like the documentation

[526.32 - 530.6400000000001] that you're working on or

[528.6 - 532.74] um some episodic memory or whatever and

[530.64 - 534.42] it can kind of confabulate or

[532.74 - 536.4590000000001] triangulate the rest of the of the

[534.42 - 538.62] missing information so for instance I

[536.459 - 541.1999999999999] don't need to describe Rome to the model

[538.62 - 542.42] when I'm talking about Rome

[541.2 - 546.6] um

[542.42 - 549.5] so that is pretty interesting not only

[546.6 - 552.3000000000001] that it is it surpasses human abilities

[549.5 - 554.16] uh in a lot of things and so here I'm

[552.3 - 556.74] just giving it a little bit of steering

[554.16 - 558.6] and off it goes to the races and I'm

[556.74 - 559.38] like okay great

[558.6 - 560.64] um

[559.38 - 561.3] great

[560.64 - 562.98] um

[561.3 - 568.0799999999999] what do you think

[562.98 - 572.22] um should we try to write act one or uh

[568.08 - 574.32] plot the rest of act two and three

[572.22 - 575.339] so let's see what it says I'm as a

[574.32 - 578.0400000000001] language model I'm happy to help you

[575.339 - 580.98] with either option okay

[578.04 - 582.18] um so that's actually good I did say at

[580.98 - 584.22] the beginning that it seems like it's a

[582.18 - 586.26] little bit hot on the biscuit so I would

[584.22 - 587.519] have expected it to say let's rate

[586.26 - 589.92] um but it seems like it's taking a

[587.519 - 592.399] little bit more balanced uh uh proposal

[589.92 - 592.399] right now

[595.08 - 598.2] yeah

[596.339 - 600.0] um you know what

[598.2 - 601.44] we don't know exactly where the story is

[600.0 - 602.76] going to end up

[601.44 - 605.2790000000001] um so

[602.76 - 608.459] I would say

[605.279 - 611.519] Let's uh because 20 000 words that's

[608.459 - 613.3199999999999] going to basically be the first act so

[611.519 - 614.88] well let's see what it let's see what it

[613.32 - 615.899] says okay

[614.88 - 618.24] um

[615.899 - 620.279] I think we should

[618.24 - 623.7] go ahead and

[620.279 - 627.8389999999999] plan and write act one in a bit more

[623.7 - 630.1800000000001] detail uh most novels are 30 to 50

[627.839 - 634.08] chapters

[630.18 - 638.3389999999999] um so act one should be

[634.08 - 644.3000000000001] um eight to uh what's that about 15.

[638.339 - 647.899] 8 to 15 chapters or so uh can you

[644.3 - 650.8389999999999] take those main plot Beats

[647.899 - 656.16] we discussed

[650.839 - 660.1800000000001] and map those onto about a dozen

[656.16 - 663.779] chapters or so please include

[660.18 - 665.459] details about what happens in each

[663.779 - 669.56] chapter

[665.459 - 675.0189999999999] um be sure to include information about

[669.56 - 675.0189999999999] plot advancement character development

[675.3 - 683.64] um world building

[678.3 - 685.079] um and uh and themes for each chapter so

[683.64 - 688.38] one thing that I have found in using

[685.079 - 690.959] chat GPT to help me write is you can

[688.38 - 694.32] weave together all four of those pillars

[690.959 - 697.0189999999999] of Storytelling in one go plot character

[694.32 - 698.7600000000001] setting theme those are the four primary

[697.019 - 701.64] ingredients you put those together you

[698.76 - 703.62] tell chat GPT that's what you want and I

[701.64 - 705.6] won't say nine times out of ten about

[703.62 - 707.88] fifty percent of the time it does pretty

[705.6 - 709.5] good A couple other times you have to

[707.88 - 711.48] say let's look at this from a slightly

[709.5 - 713.459] different perspective

[711.48 - 715.8000000000001] um and that's where I use jungian

[713.459 - 717.8389999999999] archetypes and Joseph Campbell so that

[715.8 - 719.3389999999999] it's so that it basically adopts like oh

[717.839 - 721.2600000000001] actually I know what I'm talking about

[719.339 - 723.5400000000001] when we talk about constructing a story

[721.26 - 724.3199999999999] you could also use Save the cat or any

[723.54 - 727.5] other

[724.32 - 729.3000000000001] um models uh for storytelling so you can

[727.5 - 732.019] say like let's do a five act structure

[729.3 - 735.12] like a Shakespeare or a or a four act TV

[732.019 - 737.339] structure so anyways let's see what it

[735.12 - 739.62] does with this so

[737.339 - 742.019] one of the one of the common rules is

[739.62 - 744.54] less is more

[742.019 - 746.94] um and so this is becoming increasingly

[744.54 - 749.459] true as these models become smarter you

[746.94 - 751.3800000000001] give it just enough information

[749.459 - 754.279] um to to know what your goal is and then

[751.38 - 754.279] you kind of set it free

[756.779 - 761.279] all right so introduction selling the

[758.76 - 763.56] heirloom

[761.279 - 765.0] there we go chapter three exploring Rome

[763.56 - 766.279] experiencing the city's vibrant

[765.0 - 768.779] atmosphere

[766.279 - 770.76] Rome's Landmark social classes daily

[768.779 - 772.2] life themes Discovery contrast between

[770.76 - 774.3] rich and poor

[772.2 - 777.38] chapter four a chance encounter I love

[774.3 - 777.38] these not these titles

[779.94 - 783.9200000000001] okay so because

[784.92 - 790.9399999999999] let's see I don't think I think the

[787.2 - 790.94] first Patron that's too soon

[793.98 - 799.74] because also she's like a teenager

[797.1 - 801.86] I don't know well I guess if she's 16 or

[799.74 - 801.86] whatever

[802.38 - 807.06] so

[805.2 - 809.0400000000001] yeah explores the city a public event

[807.06 - 810.2399999999999] meets an influential woman confronts her

[809.04 - 813.899] mother

[810.24 - 817.279] yeah that was act yeah hold on hold on

[813.899 - 817.279] stop stop stop stop stop

[818.04 - 823.92] hold on a second

[819.839 - 826.9200000000001] so in this case it clearly lost the plot

[823.92 - 828.899] um so because we we had five plot beats

[826.92 - 829.86] here so

[828.899 - 833.7] um

[829.86 - 836.04] let's see uh let's see please expand the

[833.7 - 841.139] five plot beats

[836.04 - 842.88] um listed below into 12 chapters

[841.139 - 844.8] um

[842.88 - 847.16] because right now it's confabulating

[844.8 - 847.16] stuff

[847.8 - 854.16] so we can see that this this task

[850.62 - 857.3] complexity is not quite up to Snuff it

[854.16 - 857.3] needs a little bit more help

[862.139 - 865.639] um yep there we go

[866.339 - 870.1800000000001] all right so let's try again

[868.44 - 871.8000000000001] here's a detailed breakdown of Act One

[870.18 - 874.5] expanding the five plot beats into 12

[871.8 - 876.3] chapters okay so it was off to an okay

[874.5 - 878.339] start I probably should have saved that

[876.3 - 880.68] but when I saw that it was It was kind

[878.339 - 883.019] of rushing through the story and to be

[880.68 - 885.66] fair rushing through the story like that

[883.019 - 888.72] is pretty typical for amateur writers

[885.66 - 892.019] actually is it takes a lot of discipline

[888.72 - 894.62] to slow down and say we'll get there

[892.019 - 894.62] um there we go

[896.279 - 900.66] I like how we're kind of starting off

[898.62 - 905.16] nice and slow the sale of the heirloom

[900.66 - 907.3199999999999] Cornelia explores Rome the public event

[905.16 - 912.019] so

[907.32 - 912.019] public event is there a new mentor

[912.899 - 918.899] Court Intrigue and social climbing

[915.8 - 921.5999999999999] she's the first major Patron okay so

[918.899 - 924.12] it's really hell-bent on just jumping

[921.6 - 927.48] the gun okay so this this is an example

[924.12 - 928.62] of what I mean by hot on the biscuit

[927.48 - 932.22] um

[928.62 - 937.26] hang on you're getting to the

[932.22 - 938.88] um to the end game now uh let's uh let's

[937.26 - 940.74] say too fast

[938.88 - 942.36] um let's slow

[940.74 - 943.98] this down

[942.36 - 946.92] um

[943.98 - 952.38] think through everything

[946.92 - 957.38] that uh that happens in act one

[952.38 - 958.92] of a story based on the three Act

[957.38 - 962.519] structure

[958.92 - 963.42] or Joseph Campbell's

[962.519 - 966.5600000000001] um

[963.42 - 966.56] hero's journey

[970.139 - 973.399] now

[971.519 - 976.079] based on that

[973.399 - 977.579] let's brainstorm so telling it to

[976.079 - 980.459] brainstorm rather than just go ahead and

[977.579 - 982.26] write let's brainstorm

[980.459 - 989.779] um

[982.26 - 989.779] 12 chapters that only adhere to act one

[989.88 - 996.899] therefore act one must end with the

[994.459 - 1000.2589999999999] Crossing the Rubicon

[996.899 - 1004.399] moment of no return

[1000.259 - 1006.259] maybe we need to discuss that before

[1004.399 - 1008.48] proceeding

[1006.259 - 1010.519] okay let's see what it says

[1008.48 - 1013.4590000000001] you're right I may have progressed too

[1010.519 - 1015.259] quickly through act one again pretty

[1013.459 - 1018.56] typical amateur

[1015.259 - 1020.1800000000001] um uh uh move since I know better I can

[1018.56 - 1021.8599999999999] keep it on track I was hoping that it

[1020.18 - 1024.339] would be able to figure that out but

[1021.86 - 1027.02] that's fine

[1024.339 - 1028.4589999999998] okay for the Crossing the Rubicon moment

[1027.02 - 1029.78] this could be when Cornelia makes a

[1028.459 - 1032.48] decision that commits her to the path of

[1029.78 - 1034.579] becoming a courtesan there we go so the

[1032.48 - 1037.4] refusal will actually probably be

[1034.579 - 1040.299] refusing the mentor the mysterious

[1037.4 - 1040.299] influential woman

[1040.76 - 1044.24] okay so since it's since I gave it a

[1043.04 - 1045.74] little bit of feedback and guidance

[1044.24 - 1049.52] let's see

[1045.74 - 1051.5] if it's able to figure out that okay so

[1049.52 - 1054.74] she's exploring Rome the sale of the

[1051.5 - 1056.96] family heirloom okay there we go there

[1054.74 - 1060.44] we go so it's slowing it down so she

[1056.96 - 1062.96] discovers the heirloom in chapter two

[1060.44 - 1064.52] um then she explores Rome she's she's

[1062.96 - 1068.059] exploring she doesn't know what's going

[1064.52 - 1071.72] on then she sells it she decides to sell

[1068.059 - 1073.6399999999999] it because she realizes oh here we go

[1071.72 - 1076.16] um and then okay so the mysterious

[1073.64 - 1078.8600000000001] figure gets there uh better life and

[1076.16 - 1080.419] loyalty to the family oh here we go a

[1078.86 - 1084.32] chance encounter she meets her future

[1080.419 - 1084.98] Mentor who introduces her to the War uh

[1084.32 - 1086.96] um

[1084.98 - 1089.539] world of courtesans

[1086.96 - 1091.039] she attends a public event where she'll

[1089.539 - 1093.26] make important connections allies and

[1091.039 - 1096.02] enemies

[1093.26 - 1098.96] um among the events guests ooh so a lot

[1096.02 - 1100.34] happens at this event the mentors offer

[1098.96 - 1101.9] there we go

[1100.34 - 1103.28] the mentor offers her guidance and

[1101.9 - 1104.6000000000001] assistance in becoming a successful

[1103.28 - 1105.9189999999999] courtesan there we go the mentor

[1104.6 - 1107.8999999999999] provides her with resources and

[1105.919 - 1109.94] connections to get started family

[1107.9 - 1112.539] tension she faces disapproval and

[1109.94 - 1114.919] concern yes that is the debate perfect

[1112.539 - 1117.2] weighing the options Cornelia considers

[1114.919 - 1118.8200000000002] the consequences and the values she

[1117.2 - 1120.44] crosses the Rubicon she accepts her

[1118.82 - 1124.3999999999999] mentor's offer

[1120.44 - 1128.6000000000001] there we go much better

[1124.4 - 1133.1000000000001] excellent much better okay let's take

[1128.6 - 1135.02] that exact outline of 12 chapters and

[1133.1 - 1139.82] expand on

[1135.02 - 1141.2] um the details uh for each one let's

[1139.82 - 1142.34] start

[1141.2 - 1144.679] um

[1142.34 - 1148.1599999999999] uh let's start by so this is what I

[1144.679 - 1149.96] found chat GPT has the best is once you

[1148.16 - 1152.179] have the chapter then you say give me

[1149.96 - 1153.8600000000001] the scenes in the chapter and honestly

[1152.179 - 1155.3200000000002] this is not a bad way for humans to

[1153.86 - 1158.539] outline it too

[1155.32 - 1159.3799999999999] let's start by expanding

[1158.539 - 1164.24] um

[1159.38 - 1168.7990000000002] uh the list uh with scenes so each

[1164.24 - 1173.32] chapter should be between one and uh

[1168.799 - 1178.4] let's say three or four uh scenes

[1173.32 - 1180.02] I think most chapters in novels are

[1178.4 - 1182.0] one to three

[1180.02 - 1182.9] so that's fine

[1182.0 - 1184.58] um

[1182.9 - 1186.2] so given

[1184.58 - 1187.48] this

[1186.2 - 1192.38] please

[1187.48 - 1196.039] restate the chapters but expand upon

[1192.38 - 1197.8400000000001] them by listing listing out and

[1196.039 - 1200.62] describing

[1197.84 - 1200.62] scenes

[1201.26 - 1205.0] um yeah all right let's see if it can

[1202.64 - 1205.0] handle that

[1205.82 - 1212.72] do yeah so again you can tell that there

[1209.299 - 1214.6399999999999] is that I as an expert am providing a

[1212.72 - 1217.179] lot of structure and guidance to this so

[1214.64 - 1217.179] that's fine

[1219.26 - 1221.72] Cornelia and her family are shown

[1220.52 - 1224.0] struggling in their daily life

[1221.72 - 1225.799] showcasing this blah blah okay so it's

[1224.0 - 1227.12] just defaulting to two scenes that's

[1225.799 - 1230.48] fine

[1227.12 - 1232.52] um certainly uh for for more amateur

[1230.48 - 1234.559] writers just following something more

[1232.52 - 1236.72] algorithmic like this is perfectly fine

[1234.559 - 1238.1] I mean you hear me talking about you

[1236.72 - 1240.5] know the three-act structure and Joseph

[1238.1 - 1242.9599999999998] Campbell and and that so on and so forth

[1240.5 - 1245.799] so I can I there there was someone had

[1242.96 - 1248.799] it wrote a comment like was it my my my

[1245.799 - 1251.179] University literature Professor

[1248.799 - 1253.16] complained that they have spent the last

[1251.179 - 1255.919] 30 years trying to undo the damage that

[1253.16 - 1257.72] Joseph Campbell did and it's like you

[1255.919 - 1260.66] know what Joseph Campbell's work has

[1257.72 - 1261.8600000000001] produced many billion dollar movies so

[1260.66 - 1263.6000000000001] you know

[1261.86 - 1266.36] um if you watch the special features of

[1263.6 - 1268.3999999999999] Avengers end game actually there's a or

[1266.36 - 1270.74] maybe it was um Iron Man

[1268.4 - 1273.0800000000002] one of them anyways so in the special

[1270.74 - 1275.24] features of some of the MCU movies near

[1273.08 - 1277.3999999999999] the end of phase four

[1275.24 - 1280.28] um they had a round table with all of

[1277.4 - 1282.74] the directors and they kept alluding to

[1280.28 - 1284.72] the old book and I'm like hmm I wonder

[1282.74 - 1286.52] if that's the hero's journey

[1284.72 - 1288.08] because if you if you're familiar with

[1286.52 - 1290.179] the hero's journey and Joseph Campbell's

[1288.08 - 1292.3999999999999] work you watch

[1290.179 - 1294.74] um you know particularly

[1292.4 - 1296.0] um the Iron Man movies and the Avenger

[1294.74 - 1299.72] movies

[1296.0 - 1302.0] um they very very algorithmically follow

[1299.72 - 1306.98] um those kinds of things

[1302.0 - 1309.32] oh okay so there we go we're almost done

[1306.98 - 1310.76] we've got two scenes for each one that's

[1309.32 - 1312.559] fine

[1310.76 - 1314.059] she confides on a close friend or

[1312.559 - 1315.62] sibling so it's still it's still kind of

[1314.059 - 1320.24] waffling like it's it's being kind of

[1315.62 - 1321.799] generic but given how long this is and

[1320.24 - 1323.24] and the fact that it's it's staying on

[1321.799 - 1325.8799999999999] the plot

[1323.24 - 1327.919] um is is pretty impressive

[1325.88 - 1330.7600000000002] um I really like this

[1327.919 - 1330.76] okay cool

[1331.82 - 1334.7] um

[1333.02 - 1339.2] I'm gonna go ahead and copy this out

[1334.7 - 1342.799] actually because this is really good

[1339.2 - 1344.96] so we come back here so act one

[1342.799 - 1347.9189999999999] um so then we'll do uh let's see

[1344.96 - 1347.919] chapters

[1349.78 - 1356.12] uh let's see

[1353.02 - 1357.5] unformatted text there we go

[1356.12 - 1359.36] um let's see how long are we at we're

[1357.5 - 1361.1] only at 22 minutes we can keep going we

[1359.36 - 1363.32] can keep going

[1361.1 - 1367.52] um let's see where should we go next

[1363.32 - 1371.36] okay where should we go next

[1367.52 - 1375.26] um what do you think what typically goes

[1371.36 - 1377.24] into planning scenes all right so let's

[1375.26 - 1378.679] see let's see if it knows now that you

[1377.24 - 1380.9] have a detailed outline for act one you

[1378.679 - 1382.46] can consider moving on to planning Act 2

[1380.9 - 1384.44] and act three however if you prefer to

[1382.46 - 1386.24] focus on act one for now you can delve

[1384.44 - 1388.1000000000001] in deeper into the planning of the

[1386.24 - 1389.6] scenes

[1388.1 - 1391.1589999999999] um let's see when planning scenes

[1389.6 - 1393.32] consider the following aspect's purpose

[1391.159 - 1394.7600000000002] ensure each scene has a clear purpose in

[1393.32 - 1397.1589999999999] advancing the plot developing characters

[1394.76 - 1399.5] or building the world

[1397.159 - 1402.3400000000001] um setting okay yep choose an

[1399.5 - 1402.34] appropriate setting

[1403.58 - 1408.799] characters okay so this is this is

[1406.1 - 1411.5] pretty generic but it's good in order to

[1408.799 - 1413.6589999999999] remind itself because there's um so

[1411.5 - 1416.84] there's this concept in Neuroscience

[1413.659 - 1419.0590000000002] called priming I'm actually reading

[1416.84 - 1421.1] this book behave

[1419.059 - 1423.2] um it is a very dense book but it's

[1421.1 - 1425.299] actually hilarious the dude who wrote it

[1423.2 - 1429.98] is sarcastic as hell

[1425.299 - 1432.74] um anyways so even just reading words of

[1429.98 - 1434.6] a particular tone can really drastically

[1432.74 - 1436.94] change your cognition and decisions and

[1434.6 - 1439.2199999999998] behavior the same is also true of

[1436.94 - 1441.14] language models just by priming it with

[1439.22 - 1443.659] some ideas like when I said think about

[1441.14 - 1445.46] Joseph Campbell and what goes into an

[1443.659 - 1448.88] act one and you saw how much it improved

[1445.46 - 1452.539] so this is called priming so a big part

[1448.88 - 1456.38] of using language models is priming

[1452.539 - 1456.3799999999999] um great cool so

[1456.74 - 1460.46] um

[1458.419 - 1461.96] I like that

[1460.46 - 1466.1000000000001] uh

[1461.96 - 1470.299] let's start with chapter one please

[1466.1 - 1473.0] write out a much more detailed outline

[1470.299 - 1475.12] of chapter one

[1473.0 - 1475.12] um

[1478.4 - 1482.7800000000002] after one the desperate decision

[1480.62 - 1484.1589999999999] scene one introducing Cornelia the story

[1482.78 - 1485.299] opens with Cornelia and her family's

[1484.159 - 1487.0390000000002] modest home providing a brief

[1485.299 - 1490.22] description of her parents and

[1487.039 - 1491.96] personality again this is all kind of uh

[1490.22 - 1494.72] algorithmic

[1491.96 - 1497.3600000000001] um if you open it this way like so if

[1494.72 - 1500.3600000000001] you if you describe the main character's

[1497.36 - 1502.8799999999999] personality or show it right off the bat

[1500.36 - 1505.1] that's going to be a little bit like

[1502.88 - 1507.44] kind of on the nose

[1505.1 - 1509.62] um whereas like you you definitely

[1507.44 - 1512.059] should demonstrate your main character

[1509.62 - 1514.3999999999999] in the first chapter

[1512.059 - 1517.1] but if you just describe it with an info

[1514.4 - 1519.7] dump that's not the best

[1517.1 - 1519.6999999999998] um let's see

[1521.9 - 1528.8200000000002] I moved on to Scene Three

[1525.14 - 1528.8200000000002] deciding to sell the heirloom

[1533.059 - 1539.12] yeah we didn't we didn't go that far

[1536.72 - 1540.679] I like that it invented the name okay

[1539.12 - 1542.539] well searching for something valuable to

[1540.679 - 1544.279] sell she discovers the family's heirloom

[1542.539 - 1547.059] okay but that doesn't happen until

[1544.279 - 1547.059] chapter two

[1547.46 - 1549.64] um

[1555.86 - 1560.74] so it looks like it looks like we need

[1557.779 - 1560.74] to prime it again

[1562.7 - 1568.82] here so we'll do we'll come back here

[1565.299 - 1570.08] and say uh out after outline of chapter

[1568.82 - 1572.0] one

[1570.08 - 1575.84] um as a reminder

[1572.0 - 1580.419] here is the grand totality of chapter

[1575.84 - 1580.4189999999999] one that we've discussed so far

[1581.679 - 1588.64] please stay Within

[1584.6 - 1588.6399999999999] the bounds of chapter one

[1591.74 - 1601.46] okay now please expand this brief

[1596.779 - 1603.08] outline into a more detailed outline so

[1601.46 - 1605.24] you might have noticed that sometimes

[1603.08 - 1607.52] what I'm doing is I'm rewriting the last

[1605.24 - 1609.02] one because what you want is if it gets

[1607.52 - 1611.0] something catastrophically wrong like

[1609.02 - 1612.679] this you want to remove it from the chat

[1611.0 - 1614.36] history because otherwise you end up

[1612.679 - 1616.52] with what's called prompt contamination

[1614.36 - 1618.9799999999998] remember how I just talked about priming

[1616.52 - 1620.9] priming works both ways it can be

[1618.98 - 1623.0] positive in that you can prime the model

[1620.9 - 1625.4] to think in the way that you want it to

[1623.0 - 1627.08] but if it has wrong information in the

[1625.4 - 1629.96] history that's going to continue

[1627.08 - 1631.58] polluting it and human like humans can

[1629.96 - 1633.8600000000001] get stuck in a rut like this too right

[1631.58 - 1635.1789999999999] remember like if you're ever having a

[1633.86 - 1637.039] discussion or you're in a meeting or

[1635.179 - 1638.3600000000001] whatever and you get the wrong idea in

[1637.039 - 1640.52] your head it can be really hard to get

[1638.36 - 1642.5] out of that rut so in that case it's

[1640.52 - 1644.059] actually kind of similar to humans one

[1642.5 - 1645.74] advantage that these models have is you

[1644.059 - 1649.0] can just flat out erase the wrong

[1645.74 - 1649.0] information from its memory

[1649.4 - 1655.9] okay so let's see if it does a little

[1651.559 - 1655.8999999999999] bit better this time also I'm uh

[1657.2 - 1662.539] uh I'm still contending with burnout

[1658.82 - 1664.039] myself and so I um I probably shouldn't

[1662.539 - 1665.9] be doing this right now but it's just

[1664.039 - 1668.84] too exciting

[1665.9 - 1670.76] okay I like this description of the

[1668.84 - 1671.6589999999999] modest home with her family highlighting

[1670.76 - 1673.76] contrast between their current

[1671.659 - 1676.159] circumstances and their once prosperous

[1673.76 - 1677.779] past there we go Cornell helps her

[1676.159 - 1679.1000000000001] mother with chores revealing her dutiful

[1677.779 - 1682.58] nature and her desire to contribute to

[1679.1 - 1685.1] the family oh that's good so this is

[1682.58 - 1687.86] showing instead of telling much much

[1685.1 - 1689.4189999999999] better so remember when it when the last

[1687.86 - 1692.059] time it was like oh we're just gonna

[1689.419 - 1694.64] tell you about her personality no wrong

[1692.059 - 1696.3799999999999] you show their personality and so you

[1694.64 - 1698.3600000000001] you show that she's helping her mother

[1696.38 - 1701.0] with chores you show that she's

[1698.36 - 1703.3999999999999] bickering with her siblings

[1701.0 - 1704.659] um you show them talking about how

[1703.4 - 1706.1000000000001] things used to be

[1704.659 - 1707.6000000000001] great

[1706.1 - 1709.1] um Cornelius father returns looking

[1707.6 - 1711.5] weary and defeated the family gathers

[1709.1 - 1714.08] for a simple Frugal meal highlighting

[1711.5 - 1715.64] their financial difficulties this is

[1714.08 - 1717.6789999999999] phenomenal

[1715.64 - 1719.9] um I'm gonna call this a day because

[1717.679 - 1722.48] holy crap

[1719.9 - 1725.3600000000001] um this is this is exciting and just to

[1722.48 - 1727.52] think that chat GPT just came out a few

[1725.36 - 1730.82] months ago that was what four months ago

[1727.52 - 1734.84] and we're already what quadrupling going

[1730.82 - 1738.32] from 8 000 tokens to 32 000 tokens

[1734.84 - 1741.02] uh this this poll that I did AGI this

[1738.32 - 1746.26] year yeah tell me what you think now

[1741.02 - 1746.26] all right that's it wrapping it up bye
