[1.36 - 5.6000000000000005] hey everybody david shapiro here with a

[3.28 - 7.759] uh another tutorial video

[5.6 - 10.16] so i know we've started with python and

[7.759 - 11.679] i'll show you something in a minute but

[10.16 - 14.16] um one thing that has come to my

[11.679 - 16.32] attention is that uh what we really need

[14.16 - 19.039] is some some basics with prompt

[16.32 - 19.92] engineering so if you're new to

[19.039 - 20.8] um

[19.92 - 24.48] to

[20.8 - 25.84] gpt3 uh and large language models the

[24.48 - 27.76] first thing that you need to know is

[25.84 - 29.84] that these are fundamentally just

[27.76 - 31.76] autocomplete engines so you know how

[29.84 - 34.079] like you have your phone and it will

[31.76 - 35.52] have like the recommended next word it's

[34.079 - 38.399] not much different than that it's just

[35.52 - 39.84] this is infinitely more sophisticated um

[38.399 - 41.76] the model i think i always get this

[39.84 - 44.239000000000004] number wrong but it takes about 700

[41.76 - 46.8] gigabytes of ram to run whereas your

[44.239 - 48.879] keyboard takes you know a few megabytes

[46.8 - 50.959999999999994] so this is like several thousand times

[48.879 - 52.559] larger of an auto complete engine but at

[50.96 - 53.92] the end of the day it's just an auto

[52.559 - 55.12] complete engine so let me show you what

[53.92 - 57.68] i mean

[55.12 - 59.76] this is the original davinci model which

[57.68 - 62.079] is also one of the harder ones to use

[59.76 - 64.72] because it has no fine tuning in order

[62.079 - 67.2] to make it more instruction friendly and

[64.72 - 69.28] so in this case you usually have to do

[67.2 - 71.2] you either have to allow it to auto

[69.28 - 72.88] complete what you've done

[71.2 - 74.4] or you have to give it a few examples

[72.88 - 76.15899999999999] which is called few shot prompting so

[74.4 - 78.32000000000001] we're going to start with the old stuff

[76.159 - 80.08000000000001] because if you build up an intuition for

[78.32 - 81.91999999999999] understanding that it's an autocomplete

[80.08 - 84.0] engine and that's it you'll understand

[81.92 - 85.759] how to use these models a lot better so

[84.0 - 87.28] we say bbc news

[85.759 - 89.52] china has tested their latest fusion

[87.28 - 90.88] reactor and then we just say go and see

[89.52 - 92.96] what it does

[90.88 - 95.6] um oh interesting so the last time i ran

[92.96 - 97.759] this it did something else um

[95.6 - 99.91999999999999] it looks like in this case it's listing

[97.759 - 103.04] a bunch of different news articles so

[99.92 - 104.64] this if you go to like news.google.com

[103.04 - 106.96000000000001] this is kind of what it looks like right

[104.64 - 109.43900000000001] where it's got you know the the source

[106.96 - 111.67999999999999] and then and then a title that's not

[109.439 - 113.439] what i expected it to do so let's run it

[111.68 - 115.2] again because this is just one way that

[113.439 - 116.63999999999999] it could auto complete it let's run it

[115.2 - 118.399] again and see what happens ah see now

[116.64 - 120.96000000000001] it's actually writing an article so you

[118.399 - 123.36] see how it seems at first bluff it might

[120.96 - 124.719] be completely random but

[123.36 - 126.0] what it's doing is it's matching a

[124.719 - 127.52] pattern

[126.0 - 129.039] let's see so china has tested their

[127.52 - 130.399] latest fusion reactor and it seems to be

[129.039 - 132.319] successful this will be a huge step for

[130.399 - 136.08] the country in the world you know etc

[132.319 - 137.51999999999998] etc and it gives me a youtube um

[136.08 - 139.76000000000002] link let's see let's see if this is

[137.52 - 141.59900000000002] actually a video

[139.76 - 142.959] nope not available okay

[141.599 - 144.79999999999998] so anyways

[142.959 - 146.8] it's an auto complete engine so this is

[144.8 - 148.31900000000002] what's called zero shot so zero shot is

[146.8 - 151.36] when you don't give it any examples you

[148.319 - 154.72] just want it to complete something

[151.36 - 156.959] so this was for a news article

[154.72 - 160.879] now if i give it instructions like

[156.959 - 162.239] write a uh a short story about an

[160.879 - 164.64] astronaut

[162.239 - 165.519] going to mars this is probably not going

[164.64 - 167.67999999999998] to work

[165.519 - 169.59900000000002] um

[167.68 - 172.64000000000001] see it's just it doesn't understand what

[169.599 - 175.92] i'm asking and it's just repeating it

[172.64 - 175.92] um let's do it again

[176.08 - 179.28] yeah so it's like giving instructions

[178.0 - 180.56] it's like no i actually wanted to write

[179.28 - 181.519] something like can you write the story

[180.56 - 184.72] for me

[181.519 - 187.20000000000002] um but if we reframe it like um

[184.72 - 188.959] we'll let's call it uh uh uh

[187.2 - 190.79999999999998] um

[188.959 - 192.159] uh

[190.8 - 194.64000000000001] jordan's

[192.159 - 196.319] mission to mars um

[194.64 - 200.0] a short story

[196.319 - 200.95899999999997] by uh let's say jimi hendrix

[200.0 - 202.959] i don't know

[200.959 - 205.2] um

[202.959 - 206.879] there once

[205.2 - 208.64] was a

[206.879 - 210.48] an astronaut

[208.64 - 213.04] named jordan

[210.48 - 215.51899999999998] and then let's see what happens

[213.04 - 215.519] there we go

[217.28 - 220.879] so by giving it just a little bit uh to

[219.519 - 221.84] start off with

[220.879 - 222.72] um

[221.84 - 224.56] it

[222.72 - 226.799] kind of went

[224.56 - 228.72] yeah the this looks like it was written

[226.799 - 230.15900000000002] by a little kid there was once an

[228.72 - 231.35999999999999] astronaut named jordan jordan was a

[230.159 - 233.2] brave astronaut who was the first

[231.36 - 235.12] astronaut on mars he was the first

[233.2 - 237.28] astronaut to ever walk on mars jordan

[235.12 - 239.12] was walking along the surface of mars he

[237.28 - 240.879] was walking on a sandy desert the planet

[239.12 - 243.519] looked so red yeah this is like written

[240.879 - 243.51899999999998] by a little kid

[243.68 - 246.31900000000002] so that's the best it could do to match

[245.04 - 248.239] that pattern now let's run it again and

[246.319 - 249.599] see what happens but you can see that

[248.239 - 250.799] it's just um

[249.599 - 252.64] oh this looks like a little more

[250.799 - 254.959] sophisticated

[252.64 - 256.799] but anyways so by cueing it up the end

[254.959 - 258.799] by kayla grady

[256.799 - 260.15999999999997] and it's a short story by jimi hendrix

[258.799 - 261.919] so i forgot what it was talking about

[260.16 - 263.52000000000004] anyways

[261.919 - 265.52] all right so this is zero shot where you

[263.52 - 267.12] basically you you spool it up by giving

[265.52 - 269.35999999999996] it something and then you just let it

[267.12 - 270.24] run like an auto complete engine

[269.36 - 272.47900000000004] um

[270.24 - 274.24] and so in that respect it's just a

[272.479 - 275.75899999999996] statistical model

[274.24 - 277.36] but what if you what if you have a very

[275.759 - 280.88] specific pattern that you want it to

[277.36 - 282.96000000000004] follow so you might say like um

[280.88 - 287.68] uh brainstorm

[282.96 - 292.79999999999995] um uh let's see a list of ideas to

[287.68 - 292.8] uh let's see a list of ideas of ways to

[293.36 - 297.759] survive on mars so this is something

[296.0 - 299.52] that it's probably seen

[297.759 - 301.6] in its training data like on reddit or

[299.52 - 304.4] stack exchange or whatever and so then

[301.6 - 304.40000000000003] if we do this

[304.639 - 307.919] what would you need to bring so it's not

[306.32 - 309.28] it's just asking questions it's not

[307.919 - 311.35999999999996] actually answering them so that's no

[309.28 - 312.79999999999995] good right let's do it again and see if

[311.36 - 315.44] we can get it to

[312.8 - 316.32] oh there we go okay

[315.44 - 318.8] um

[316.32 - 321.039] oh look and so then it starts

[318.8 - 321.61] it goes off

[321.039 - 323.59999999999997] matt damon

[321.61 - 325.759] [Laughter]

[323.6 - 326.72] yeah so then it completely changes topic

[325.759 - 328.639] and it's like well that's not what i

[326.72 - 329.68] wanted i wanted this list

[328.639 - 331.199] right

[329.68 - 333.199] um

[331.199 - 335.84000000000003] gather water from the water crystals

[333.199 - 337.44] okay get oxygen from the oxygen crystals

[335.84 - 338.479] this is so random find a way to grow

[337.44 - 340.88] food

[338.479 - 341.68] um find a way to build a radio so that

[340.88 - 342.639] okay

[341.68 - 344.56] so

[342.639 - 346.16] you can see where it was just like okay

[344.56 - 348.479] it just kind of goes off the rails and

[346.16 - 350.40000000000003] runs with it this was original da vinci

[348.479 - 353.68] um so how do you get it to do what you

[350.4 - 356.0] want well so what you can do then is one

[353.68 - 357.759] shot um so what i've shown you up to

[356.0 - 359.84] this point is zero shot where it's just

[357.759 - 361.12] like let me just give you an initial

[359.84 - 362.71999999999997] prompt and treat you like an

[361.12 - 364.56] autocomplete engine just like you know

[362.72 - 366.16] you hit the next thing on your your

[364.56 - 367.12] keyboard and let it go and see what

[366.16 - 368.47900000000004] happens

[367.12 - 370.0] um

[368.479 - 372.24] now what you can do then is what's

[370.0 - 373.84] called a one shot prompt so one shot

[372.24 - 376.479] prompt is where you give it one example

[373.84 - 378.88] of what you want and then and then you

[376.479 - 380.71999999999997] uh then you set it free so then i give

[378.88 - 383.12] it an example brainstorm a list i have

[380.72 - 386.47900000000004] ideas of how to survive on mars so now

[383.12 - 390.0] let's brainstorm a list of ideas of ways

[386.479 - 392.4] to survive on a deserted

[390.0 - 392.4] island

[392.96 - 396.23999999999995] okay so in this case it's called one

[394.56 - 398.8] shot because i give it one example of

[396.24 - 400.24] what i need and then

[398.8 - 401.68] because it's basically a pattern

[400.24 - 403.199] matching thing

[401.68 - 405.52] it can keep going

[403.199 - 406.639] so find food find water find shelter

[405.52 - 408.15999999999997] find a way to communicate with the

[406.639 - 411.12] outside world it basically gave me the

[408.16 - 413.44] same kind of of information here

[411.12 - 415.919] brainstorm a list of ideas to serve on a

[413.44 - 417.759] deserted island and it repeated it so

[415.919 - 420.56] you see these repetitions happening how

[417.759 - 423.039] do you get that to stop here you can do

[420.56 - 424.56] backslash n backslash n so that's

[423.039 - 426.15999999999997] newline newline

[424.56 - 429.039] so what will happen is if it gives you a

[426.16 - 431.03900000000004] double new line it'll stop whoops

[429.039 - 433.52] gather food and water find shelter oh

[431.039 - 435.44] wait it didn't stop why didn't it stop i

[433.52 - 436.639] wonder if it's um

[435.44 - 438.96] rn

[436.639 - 441.44] slash rn

[438.96 - 444.479] so there's several ways that it can do

[441.44 - 446.8] new lines so slash r is carriage return

[444.479 - 450.4] and slash n is newline

[446.8 - 452.56] um let's see if that works

[450.4 - 455.039] nope still not stopping

[452.56 - 457.919] what the actual heck

[455.039 - 457.919] that's really weird

[459.44 - 464.0] because the stop sequence should

[462.08 - 466.8] unless it might be it might be treating

[464.0 - 468.879] this like text let me do view code

[466.8 - 471.52000000000004] oh yeah so see what it did is it escaped

[468.879 - 473.52000000000004] my backslashes

[471.52 - 475.35999999999996] so while we're here let me show you

[473.52 - 477.12] something super useful if you're trying

[475.36 - 479.039] to get if you if you get a result that

[477.12 - 480.479] you like in here with all the settings

[479.039 - 482.87899999999996] and stuff you just click view code and

[480.479 - 485.039] it'll pop up and show you like oh look

[482.879 - 486.56] here's the uh here's here's what you did

[485.039 - 487.84] and so the stop sequence right here

[486.56 - 490.96] where you see it says backslash

[487.84 - 492.79999999999995] backslash n and backslash backslash n

[490.96 - 494.08] that means it's escaping it so it's

[492.8 - 495.91900000000004] removing it

[494.08 - 498.0] as a regex so it's not evaluating it

[495.919 - 500.0] like regex i want it to evaluate it like

[498.0 - 501.919] regex but it's not gonna do that so

[500.0 - 502.96] unfortunately that's not gonna work

[501.919 - 504.479] um

[502.96 - 507.599] brainstorm a list of ideas for a haunted

[504.479 - 510.96] house now that's great um

[507.599 - 512.88] uh okay so if we if we stick with this

[510.96 - 515.279] we say all right so we're brainstorming

[512.88 - 517.68] so then if we do few shot where we give

[515.279 - 520.56] it a couple different examples

[517.68 - 523.1999999999999] so let's go ahead and let it finish

[520.56 - 523.1999999999999] finish this

[523.279 - 525.519] okay

[525.76 - 529.2] so then we say all right let's take out

[527.6 - 530.88] survive and we're just saying this is

[529.2 - 533.6800000000001] brainstorming and you notice how it's

[530.88 - 536.48] doing four items for each it's copying

[533.68 - 537.76] um it's copying the pattern exactly so

[536.48 - 539.6] now we're going to give it two examples

[537.76 - 541.4399999999999] where it's it's brainstorming entirely

[539.6 - 543.6] different things brainstorm a list of

[541.44 - 545.2] ideas of ways to survive on mars

[543.6 - 548.5600000000001] brainstorm a list of ideas for a haunted

[545.2 - 552.9590000000001] house uh let's see brainstorm a list of

[548.56 - 554.959] ideas to solve climate change so

[552.959 - 556.16] completely different domains

[554.959 - 557.68] um

[556.16 - 559.279] but i shouldn't even need to put in the

[557.68 - 561.4399999999999] one because it will it will have seen

[559.279 - 563.36] this pattern so remember it's

[561.44 - 565.6800000000001] autocomplete it's an autocomplete engine

[563.36 - 567.839] but it's also a pattern matching and

[565.68 - 569.68] pattern generation engine

[567.839 - 571.6800000000001] so that's how autocomplete works it says

[569.68 - 573.279] oh i've seen this pattern before like if

[571.68 - 575.1999999999999] you start it with a bbc news article it

[573.279 - 577.6] says i've seen plenty of bbc articles

[575.2 - 579.76] why because gbt3 was chained on you know

[577.6 - 581.2] hundreds of gigabytes of internet data

[579.76 - 582.8] um okay

[581.2 - 584.399] plant trees change the way yep there you

[582.8 - 586.0799999999999] go

[584.399 - 588.839] um actually here i thought of a good

[586.08 - 591.279] stop that we can use we can say

[588.839 - 593.2790000000001] brainstorm a list

[591.279 - 595.04] there that's gonna be our new stop

[593.279 - 598.32] um okay

[595.04 - 600.0799999999999] and so you can see like um i chose i

[598.32 - 602.72] chose something that is gonna that is

[600.08 - 604.88] gonna appear in a specific place and

[602.72 - 606.88] that'll be my new stop so plant trees

[604.88 - 608.56] change the way we produce energy change

[606.88 - 611.6] the transportation system change how we

[608.56 - 614.3199999999999] use energy um okay that's great these

[611.6 - 616.0] are not the best the best examples um

[614.32 - 617.36] because it's basically what it's copying

[616.0 - 619.279] is the amount of effort put into each

[617.36 - 620.72] one so like if we were to go back and

[619.279 - 622.56] expand on each of these and i'll show

[620.72 - 625.44] you in just a second what i mean

[622.56 - 627.1999999999999] um then it would uh it would do better

[625.44 - 630.5600000000001] all right so we're building up to a few

[627.2 - 633.36] shot examples so in in the original

[630.56 - 635.68] gpt3 what you'd have to do is in order

[633.36 - 638.64] to get very consistent output you'd have

[635.68 - 642.8] to give it several examples in every

[638.64 - 645.04] single prompt and that gets real old

[642.8 - 646.959] because you're basically training it

[645.04 - 647.92] very quickly to do what you want so

[646.959 - 650.399] let's do

[647.92 - 652.24] brainstorm a list of

[650.399 - 653.92] ideas to

[652.24 - 655.76] uh let's see what are we going to try

[653.92 - 656.88] and do um

[655.76 - 661.279] let's see

[656.88 - 663.279] something completely off the wall uh

[661.279 - 667.2] build the fanciest

[663.279 - 669.4399999999999] uh gaming pc ever

[667.2 - 671.6800000000001] and then we'll take out that all right

[669.44 - 672.839] we'll see what it does

[671.68 - 675.12] okay that's not

[672.839 - 676.48] particularly fascinating get the best

[675.12 - 678.079] computer parts get the best gaming

[676.48 - 679.9200000000001] monitor get the bet get a great gaming

[678.079 - 682.7199999999999] mouse get a gaming keyboard

[679.92 - 684.0] okay great whatever

[682.72 - 685.76] none of these are particularly

[684.0 - 687.519] impressive but the point here is to show

[685.76 - 689.76] you the difference between zero shot one

[687.519 - 691.519] shot and few shot prompting let me do a

[689.76 - 693.519] quick time check all right we're at 11

[691.519 - 695.44] minutes let's cut it off there

[693.519 - 698.079] this will be a whole series but this is

[695.44 - 700.0] just showing you the basics of think of

[698.079 - 702.079] it as an autocomplete engine and there

[700.0 - 704.8] are three primary types of problems it's

[702.079 - 707.04] zero shot one shot and few shot once you

[704.8 - 709.4399999999999] build up an intuition for how

[707.04 - 712.079] um how these language models work then

[709.44 - 714.5600000000001] you'll understand the value of like the

[712.079 - 716.399] instruct series models and other ones

[714.56 - 718.8] that are aligned and and how they're

[716.399 - 721.2] fine-tuned and why that fine-tuning

[718.8 - 723.04] makes them more useful in certain ways

[721.2 - 724.5600000000001] all right thanks for watching uh like

[723.04 - 726.639] and subscribe and consider supporting me
