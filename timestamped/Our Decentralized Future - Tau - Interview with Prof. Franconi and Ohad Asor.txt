[1.02 - 8.46] hey everybody David Shapiro here we have

[4.259 - 11.34] a very very special podcast today for

[8.46 - 13.920000000000002] our decentralized future in this podcast

[11.34 - 19.92] episode I interview professor franconi

[13.92 - 22.259999999999998] and Ohad asor uh from Tao now tau is a

[19.92 - 25.019000000000002] company it is a startup well it's been

[22.26 - 27.3] around since 2015 and they are working

[25.019 - 29.22] on decentralized artificial intelligence

[27.3 - 30.66] but it's a kind of artificial

[29.22 - 33.3] intelligence that you might not be

[30.66 - 37.26] familiar with it is incredibly

[33.3 - 39.12] disruptive and uh it's pretty it's

[37.26 - 41.879] pretty complex and that's why this

[39.12 - 44.28] episode is so long but just to give you

[41.879 - 47.82] kind of a preview as to what this

[44.28 - 51.6] technology does is that it decentralizes

[47.82 - 54.6] the development of software now that

[51.6 - 56.34] might sound very simple and conceptually

[54.6 - 58.379000000000005] it is simple there's a lot of problems

[56.34 - 61.86] that go into that but the other thing

[58.379 - 64.32] that it does is it creates a store for

[61.86 - 67.439] all human knowledge as it develops

[64.32 - 69.53999999999999] software and solves problems and so

[67.439 - 71.46] because of that the network gets more

[69.54 - 73.68] intelligent over time and gains new

[71.46 - 75.29899999999999] capabilities over time

[73.68 - 78.659] and that

[75.299 - 80.759] has a just absolutely profound

[78.659 - 82.68] astounding implications which we get to

[80.759 - 84.72] by the end of the episode so I just

[82.68 - 87.06] wanted to give a brief introduction and

[84.72 - 89.46] then and then we can go ahead and dive

[87.06 - 91.5] into the episode so I hope you enjoy

[89.46 - 94.759] this interview with professor franconi

[91.5 - 94.759] and Ohad of Tau

[95.7 - 101.759] thanks everyone for joining this episode

[98.759 - 104.22] of our decentralized future uh today's

[101.759 - 106.619] episode is really exciting we've been

[104.22 - 108.6] looking forward to it for quite a while

[106.619 - 111.78] um I've got with me Professor Enrico

[108.6 - 114.53999999999999] franconi and Ohad osor

[111.78 - 117.42] um from Tau now these folks have been

[114.54 - 119.28] working on the Tau Network for since uh

[117.42 - 122.399] 2015 I believe

[119.28 - 125.04] and uh this is an incredible technology

[122.399 - 128.459] it took me a little while to understand

[125.04 - 130.56] it and once I did I realized this is the

[128.459 - 132.66] way of the future and so when they

[130.56 - 134.28] reached out to me and asked me to uh to

[132.66 - 135.959] host this episode I said yes absolutely

[134.28 - 138.18] let's do it

[135.959 - 139.98] um so without further Ado I'd like to

[138.18 - 142.34] introduce my guest today so first we

[139.98 - 145.61999999999998] have um Professor Enrico francone

[142.34 - 147.06] who is uh

[145.62 - 150.92000000000002] welcome

[147.06 - 153.3] um who has been uh like myself a uh

[150.92 - 154.98] lifelong Problem Solver

[153.3 - 156.78] um and our in our introductory

[154.98 - 159.48] discussion he told me all about how he

[156.78 - 161.76] just loves solving tough problems and

[159.48 - 163.56] here we are working on very difficult

[161.76 - 165.89999999999998] ones so uh Professor would you like to

[163.56 - 168.72] give us a couple words about yourself to

[165.9 - 171.59900000000002] introduce yourself okay thank you

[168.72 - 173.519] um well I am a professor in computer

[171.599 - 175.79999999999998] science in general but most specifically

[173.519 - 178.28] in Ai and another representation since

[175.8 - 181.92000000000002] more than 30 years now

[178.28 - 184.44] and what I like to do and what I believe

[181.92 - 189.72] is the right thing to do in in the field

[184.44 - 192.3] of AI is to provide technologies that

[189.72 - 195.239] um make sure that whatever system you

[192.3 - 199.20000000000002] build based on AI can be trusted

[195.239 - 202.20000000000002] so and we know that the the science of

[199.2 - 206.33999999999997] trust since 2000 years is logic

[202.2 - 208.5] and so basically this is leading to a

[206.34 - 211.14000000000001] scientific field research field which is

[208.5 - 212.819] called computational logic and the

[211.14 - 215.33999999999997] computational logic applied it to AI

[212.819 - 218.04] brings to what is called now logical AI

[215.34 - 221.4] which is what I'm doing and and I found

[218.04 - 223.739] in Tau a group of people there is a

[221.4 - 226.26000000000002] smart group of people that have the same

[223.739 - 229.20000000000002] ideas made the same goals as my research

[226.26 - 231.84] goals they of course want to make a real

[229.2 - 233.159] world system and while I'm just a

[231.84 - 235.14000000000001] professor from the University doing

[233.159 - 238.739] research so I think that joining these

[235.14 - 241.01899999999998] efforts is something very interesting

[238.739 - 244.58] excellent thank you so much for the

[241.019 - 244.58] introduction and for being here today

[253.939 - 262.62] in early 2015 after someone from from

[259.26 - 266.12] the internet and they told me someone

[262.62 - 269.1] Anonymous told me about an idea and how

[266.12 - 271.5] about the necessity and the idea for a

[269.1 - 273.72] blockchain to be controlled by its users

[271.5 - 276.72] and he came up with some initial design

[273.72 - 279.96000000000004] but it changed a lot since then

[276.72 - 283.74] and that's how it all started

[279.96 - 285.29999999999995] excellent yeah so speaking of blockchain

[283.74 - 287.699] um that will be a that is one of the

[285.3 - 289.259] major Technologies uh underpinning the

[287.699 - 291.24] Tau Network

[289.259 - 294.0] um but before we get into some of the

[291.24 - 296.16] technical details in the history of Tau

[294.0 - 299.46] um let's hit on let's ask the big

[296.16 - 301.62] question uh for our for our viewers what

[299.46 - 303.479] is the what is the general goal is to

[301.62 - 305.58] create this decentralized network can

[303.479 - 307.44] you guys give us a little bit like a

[305.58 - 311.46] high level overview what is the goal of

[307.44 - 313.5] Tau and and and of decentralization

[311.46 - 315.29999999999995] um who would anyone who can who would

[313.5 - 317.66] like to go first uh Professor franconi

[315.3 - 317.66] or Ohio

[317.699 - 323.52000000000004] hahaha

[320.52 - 325.25899999999996] in all existing decentralized networks

[323.52 - 327.9] there is some

[325.259 - 330.06] big elephant in the room of something

[327.9 - 332.28] very centralized everyone somehow

[330.06 - 333.18] ignores maybe maybe not everyone which

[332.28 - 336.539] is

[333.18 - 339.06] the centralized development team

[336.539 - 340.56] how can we seriously take a

[339.06 - 342.479] decentralized economy like I don't know

[340.56 - 344.699] Bitcoin

[342.479 - 347.3] controlled by a bunch of computer geeks

[344.699 - 347.3] like me

[347.46 - 355.44] how can how can it be any wide enough

[352.199 - 357.62] shoulders to carry the whole the whole

[355.44 - 357.62] world

[357.72 - 361.97900000000004] the centralized control of the

[360.24 - 363.78000000000003] development team

[361.979 - 366.71999999999997] he's a big bottleneck

[363.78 - 368.58] for adoption and it is a problem by its

[366.72 - 370.199] own who promises that

[368.58 - 372.419] the centralized development team will

[370.199 - 374.34000000000003] take the right economic decisions and

[372.419 - 376.62] indeed they themselves know this and

[374.34 - 378.65999999999997] therefore they avoid taking economic

[376.62 - 380.88] decisions

[378.66 - 383.46000000000004] I'll give you the centralized in a sound

[380.88 - 386.819] way in a constructive way

[383.46 - 389.06] that how the network itself should be

[386.819 - 389.06] like

[389.759 - 392.96000000000004] and that's what we do

[393.78 - 399.419] so to say that in another way the goal

[397.5 - 402.06] is as you said

[399.419 - 404.46] um to take control away but not from

[402.06 - 407.28000000000003] from everyone but to take control away

[404.46 - 408.78] from any kind of centralization and

[407.28 - 410.63899999999995] distribute it to everyone who

[408.78 - 412.25899999999996] participates in a network and the

[410.639 - 414.539] example that you gave is like Bitcoin or

[412.259 - 417.72] other economic networks so that that way

[414.539 - 419.94] everyone has a stake in deciding not

[417.72 - 422.46000000000004] just what the network does or what the

[419.94 - 425.52] organization does but how it is coded

[422.46 - 427.79999999999995] correctly even participating in the in

[425.52 - 429.56] the development and building of that

[427.8 - 434.12] Network true

[429.56 - 434.12] that's height you can look at it

[438.18 - 443.58] software is there for one and only one

[441.36 - 445.039] thing which is the users software is

[443.58 - 449.15999999999997] only for the users

[445.039 - 452.81899999999996] but somehow the users have

[449.16 - 455.09900000000005] little to no voice or influence on how

[452.819 - 457.62] the software should be like next time

[455.099 - 459.84] your phones ask to update itself how

[457.62 - 463.199] does it feel who knows what they put

[459.84 - 465.479] them ah if it doesn't feel good

[463.199 - 467.039] but it's all for the users you are the

[465.479 - 469.199] user why you don't have control over

[467.039 - 472.86] this

[469.199 - 475.8] well there are very serious

[472.86 - 477.599] um theoretical practical social problems

[475.8 - 480.479] associated with it

[477.599 - 482.52] you can ask how can a large group of

[480.479 - 485.58] people the whole audience

[482.52 - 488.039] take any collaborative decision whether

[485.58 - 490.25899999999996] it's blockchain also for anything that's

[488.039 - 492.479] a big problem by its own

[490.259 - 495.72] and then you have an even bigger problem

[492.479 - 497.639] how can a large group of people not only

[495.72 - 499.86] take a decision together but even have a

[497.639 - 503.72] discussion how can one million people

[499.86 - 503.72] have a meaningful discussion altogether

[504.24 - 509.879] and those are indeed problems that we

[506.879 - 511.56] address upon the theoretical problems

[509.879 - 513.599] there are some very deep theoretical

[511.56 - 514.86] problems here that we can speak about

[513.599 - 516.479] right

[514.86 - 519.0600000000001] and

[516.479 - 520.5600000000001] yes in methodological problems and we

[519.06 - 521.64] can speak about everything

[520.56 - 524.6999999999999] yes

[521.64 - 526.14] yeah so the the conceptual problems like

[524.7 - 527.58] you said it's it's a matter of

[526.14 - 531.12] organization

[527.58 - 532.62] um is is one thing is for for anyone in

[531.12 - 535.14] the audience who has ever participated

[532.62 - 539.22] in any kind of software development or

[535.14 - 540.36] or any kind of um uh concerted group

[539.22 - 542.58] effort

[540.36 - 545.339] um organization becomes intractable once

[542.58 - 547.26] the group gets too big but with

[545.339 - 549.1800000000001] technology platforms today that affect

[547.26 - 551.76] everyone to your example you know

[549.18 - 553.1999999999999] everyone uses phones computers uh you

[551.76 - 555.06] know whatever you're watching this this

[553.2 - 557.58] video on today

[555.06 - 559.1999999999999] um that has there's a lot of control and

[557.58 - 561.0] management that goes into that but then

[559.2 - 563.339] countless hundreds thousands of

[561.0 - 567.42] developers that go into that uh that

[563.339 - 569.1] effort and organizing that is uh not a

[567.42 - 571.1999999999999] solved problem and as you mentioned

[569.1 - 573.1800000000001] there's conceptual and methodological

[571.2 - 575.1] um topics that we'll delve into in just

[573.18 - 577.7399999999999] a little bit about how to solve those

[575.1 - 578.76] problems uh Professor franconi did you

[577.74 - 580.38] have any

[578.76 - 583.62] um anything to add to kind of the

[580.38 - 587.519] overall goal of the Tau Network well uh

[583.62 - 590.76] when you have this goal of involving so

[587.519 - 593.4590000000001] many agents participating to this uh to

[590.76 - 596.7] this effort then something that you have

[593.459 - 599.459] to uh somehow

[596.7 - 601.5600000000001] something you have to think about is how

[599.459 - 604.0189999999999] these agents this one million people or

[601.56 - 607.0189999999999] whatever even more than 10 people can

[604.019 - 609.24] trust the system uh that is taking this

[607.019 - 612.0] helping them to take decisions and

[609.24 - 614.22] clearly the good old way of discussing

[612.0 - 615.959] so I hear to you I hear you you hear me

[614.22 - 617.7] I try to understand what you're saying

[615.959 - 620.0999999999999] if I don't understand I ask you to for

[617.7 - 622.2] clarification you you reply you

[620.1 - 624.2] meanwhile understand what I'm saying so

[622.2 - 626.399] there is a protocol in communication

[624.2 - 628.38] that help us to understand each other

[626.399 - 631.92] and to reach an agreement

[628.38 - 634.399] and and this protocol follows as we know

[631.92 - 637.0799999999999] since 2000 years logical rules so the

[634.399 - 639.54] say the notion of argumentation and

[637.08 - 641.279] syllogism studies from the ancient Greek

[639.54 - 643.92] philosophers and so on and rhodesians in

[641.279 - 647.579] 19th century and the 20th century

[643.92 - 648.899] however when we want to scale up you and

[647.579 - 651.3] then you want to say well we can't

[648.899 - 652.76] really imagine a protocol

[651.3 - 655.079] that

[652.76 - 658.26] involves discussion and trying to

[655.079 - 660.3] understanding and so many agents even

[658.26 - 662.7] just more than 10 whatever we realized

[660.3 - 664.26] our everyday life if we try to make a

[662.7 - 667.44] meeting with more than 10 people I mean

[664.26 - 670.86] unless you have a major coordinator

[667.44 - 673.019] that tries to understand everyone and

[670.86 - 674.82] try to mediate then this this discussion

[673.019 - 677.579] is not is not going anywhere however

[674.82 - 679.9200000000001] even this mediator cannot do anything if

[677.579 - 683.16] there are 100 people in the room

[679.92 - 685.3199999999999] uh so how do we reach agreement how can

[683.16 - 687.36] we trust and how the user can trust this

[685.32 - 690.12] agreement then this is where logic comes

[687.36 - 691.88] in so this new protocol of argumentation

[690.12 - 695.279] and discussion and finding agreement is

[691.88 - 697.8] in my opinion has to be granted on Logic

[695.279 - 699.959] on on the idea that whatever decision

[697.8 - 702.54] the system takes is

[699.959 - 704.16] uh can be trusted and what is

[702.54 - 706.38] interesting I guess this will be

[704.16 - 709.4399999999999] discussed in depth later

[706.38 - 712.8] is that in the logical language of Tau

[709.44 - 715.2600000000001] uh allows also to discuss

[712.8 - 718.3199999999999] the protocol on how we reach agreements

[715.26 - 721.74] and and we can Define so user can agree

[718.32 - 724.38] on how they will agree from now on

[721.74 - 726.1800000000001] again an understanding fully and and

[724.38 - 727.56] entrust on this new form of agreement

[726.18 - 731.519] potentially

[727.56 - 733.26] and so that's my perspective on whatever

[731.519 - 735.6] I had said before

[733.26 - 738.42] so my my contribution my interest is in

[735.6 - 740.22] this logical Foundation of all these

[738.42 - 743.579] things

[740.22 - 747.36] okay excellent thank you so much so to

[743.579 - 750.959] to summarize uh another function of Tau

[747.36 - 753.72] so one one part is developing software

[750.959 - 755.5189999999999] in a decentralized manner but the other

[753.72 - 758.399] part of that or I guess a problem that

[755.519 - 760.26] you have to solve to do that is coming

[758.399 - 762.18] to consensus with large groups of people

[760.26 - 764.3389999999999] how do you collaborate and come to

[762.18 - 765.3599999999999] consensus with arbitrarily large groups

[764.339 - 768.72] and that's what you're talking about

[765.36 - 772.0790000000001] with coming up with logical uh protocols

[768.72 - 774.12] uh and and such in order to arrive at

[772.079 - 776.2199999999999] those agreements or arrive at consensus

[774.12 - 778.2] is that is that a good summary

[776.22 - 779.88] yes yeah

[778.2 - 782.1600000000001] okay yeah I would say that your

[779.88 - 784.68] perspective of Ohio just to mention to

[782.16 - 786.36] to specify this summary so in a sense

[784.68 - 789.12] also this protocol is a piece of

[786.36 - 790.44] software is a procedure that regulates

[789.12 - 792.9590000000001] this this conversation these

[790.44 - 795.139] argumentations and as such it will be

[792.959 - 797.88] subject to the same

[795.139 - 800.94] ways of being developed and understood

[797.88 - 805.68] and agreed upon as the general software

[800.94 - 808.5] development or consensual finding in Tao

[805.68 - 811.1999999999999] okay excellent yes and we will we will

[808.5 - 813.24] delve into um into tau's particular

[811.2 - 815.0400000000001] Solutions here in just a moment

[813.24 - 816.72] um but a quick preview for the audience

[815.04 - 818.6999999999999] so some of the things that they've

[816.72 - 820.2] worked on and this is not an exhaustive

[818.7 - 822.0600000000001] list of of the breakthroughs that

[820.2 - 825.1800000000001] they've had one is the Tau metal

[822.06 - 827.399] language the Tau language and the Agora

[825.18 - 828.66] token but we'll get into those in just a

[827.399 - 831.12] little bit

[828.66 - 832.98] um so well thank you for helping get us

[831.12 - 835.2] oriented as to what are the problems

[832.98 - 837.0600000000001] that Tao is trying to solve

[835.2 - 839.1600000000001] um but let's take

[837.06 - 841.1999999999999] a step to the side just for a second

[839.16 - 843.36] because

[841.2 - 844.5] um what I want to do is is just spend a

[843.36 - 846.12] few minutes

[844.5 - 847.38] um informing the audience for anyone who

[846.12 - 849.12] doesn't know what a Dao is a

[847.38 - 851.279] decentralized autonomous organization

[849.12 - 853.92] and how that relates to other existing

[851.279 - 855.36] Technologies like blockchain Ohad would

[853.92 - 858.8] you like to kind of introduce the

[855.36 - 858.8000000000001] concept of the Dow and the blockchain

[860.66 - 866.519] I am

[863.22 - 870.6] though isn't it something that

[866.519 - 873.0] um intended to to be an organization

[870.6 - 874.74] that is controlled by the users that is

[873.0 - 879.06] decentralized

[874.74 - 881.4590000000001] and and typically they do so by

[879.06 - 883.0189999999999] um very basic means so remember that I

[881.459 - 887.76] asked before how can a large group of

[883.019 - 889.86] people can reach agreement well voting

[887.76 - 892.68] that's the method that comes to mind and

[889.86 - 896.339] that's what existing doubts basically do

[892.68 - 900.2399999999999] and but maybe to take a step ahead there

[896.339 - 902.2790000000001] is one fundamental problem with voting

[900.24 - 904.5600000000001] the problem is that

[902.279 - 907.4399999999999] even though everyone

[904.56 - 910.1389999999999] have equal I to vote it is still not the

[907.44 - 914.1600000000001] case that everyone have effectively

[910.139 - 916.5600000000001] equalized to propose what to vote over

[914.16 - 918.36] because even if you have the right to

[916.56 - 920.16] propose

[918.36 - 923.0600000000001] who is going to even read a million

[920.16 - 923.06] proposals a day

[923.22 - 928.5600000000001] so even if everyone have right to

[925.199 - 931.8599999999999] proposities by no means effective

[928.56 - 933.7399999999999] so what people do is create hierarchies

[931.86 - 936.6] that in particular

[933.74 - 938.699] determine what to vote over

[936.6 - 940.44] but then you get huge loss of

[938.699 - 942.8389999999999] information it

[940.44 - 945.1800000000001] your opinion no matter how good it is or

[942.839 - 947.899] correct it is will most likely not be

[945.18 - 947.899] incorporated

[948.36 - 955.0790000000001] and these fundamental real life problem

[950.76 - 957.26] is also reflected in the Taos as we know

[955.079 - 957.26] them

[961.68 - 965.579] the the

[963.779 - 967.4399999999999] one of the chief well so there's there's

[965.579 - 969.18] a few problems that you elucidated here

[967.44 - 971.639] so one is is

[969.18 - 973.62] at present one of the one of the ways

[971.639 - 975.3] that everyone is familiar with in terms

[973.62 - 977.579] of making group decisions larger

[975.3 - 979.4399999999999] decisions is voting but there are some

[977.579 - 980.399] problems with voting and we'll get into

[979.44 - 982.2600000000001] that

[980.399 - 984.06] um but then also as you said

[982.26 - 985.98] even just integrating everyone's

[984.06 - 988.26] feedback that's a huge problem and that

[985.98 - 990.1800000000001] goes to to the problem of anytime you

[988.26 - 992.22] have more than 10 people in a room you

[990.18 - 994.1389999999999] can't hear everyone you can't get

[992.22 - 996.5400000000001] everyone's opinion but then if you get

[994.139 - 998.16] to the scale of thousands millions

[996.54 - 999.5999999999999] whatever

[998.16 - 1001.42] um you have to as you say create you

[999.6 - 1005.0] have to delegate or create hierarchies

[1001.42 - 1006.68] and and one of your points is that Dows

[1005.0 - 1008.72] have not have not fully solved this

[1006.68 - 1010.6389999999999] problem yet so this is this is something

[1008.72 - 1013.22] that differentiates the Tau network from

[1010.639 - 1016.54] an ordinary decentralized autonomous

[1013.22 - 1016.5400000000001] organization correct

[1016.699 - 1022.06] and yes yes very much so so you can you

[1020.24 - 1025.22] can look at it as

[1022.06 - 1026.54] using the economical term of diminishing

[1025.22 - 1028.459] returns

[1026.54 - 1031.1] so in economy

[1028.459 - 1034.64] um diminishing returns means uh like a

[1031.1 - 1036.579] typical example is that each a new team

[1034.64 - 1039.439] member in a company

[1036.579 - 1040.6989999999998] contributes less than the next one so if

[1039.439 - 1042.799] you have 10 people and you add another

[1040.699 - 1044.78] one it's not going to be 10 tradition

[1042.799 - 1048.02] it's going to be less

[1044.78 - 1050.12] similarly in discussions

[1048.02 - 1051.86] um if you double the number of

[1050.12 - 1053.12] participants you are not going to get

[1051.86 - 1056.7199999999998] double

[1053.12 - 1061.6] the outcome and at some point you are

[1056.72 - 1061.6000000000001] even going to get Negative outcome

[1061.82 - 1067.28] and indeed our solution solves this

[1064.7 - 1069.5] problem completely in the sense that if

[1067.28 - 1072.3799999999999] you will have 100 times more people you

[1069.5 - 1075.1] will have 100 times more utility

[1072.38 - 1075.1000000000001] at least

[1075.32 - 1079.1599999999999] that is a big claim but uh I believe it

[1077.78 - 1081.2] and hopefully by the end of the episode

[1079.16 - 1082.46] our users or our viewers will believe it

[1081.2 - 1085.52] too

[1082.46 - 1087.14] um Professor franconi um previously we

[1085.52 - 1089.48] talked about some of the some of the

[1087.14 - 1092.96] specific problems uh conceptual problems

[1089.48 - 1094.34] with this in terms of and also Ohad

[1092.96 - 1096.919] um either of you feel free to jump in

[1094.34 - 1099.1999999999998] but the limitations of language of

[1096.919 - 1100.88] English language or German French you

[1099.2 - 1103.76] know any naturally can conceived

[1100.88 - 1106.94] language there are limitations that that

[1103.76 - 1109.76] also help or I guess prevent

[1106.94 - 1112.52] um you know agreement or that utility

[1109.76 - 1114.86] um so what uh what I would like to do is

[1112.52 - 1116.12] ask what are some of those what are some

[1114.86 - 1118.4599999999998] of those limitations and what are some

[1116.12 - 1120.86] of the solutions conceptual solutions to

[1118.46 - 1121.58] the limitations of human language or

[1120.86 - 1124.1599999999999] even

[1121.58 - 1126.32] um uh formal logic as well

[1124.16 - 1127.88] okay I would not say that the language

[1126.32 - 1129.4399999999998] natural language is limited is actually

[1127.88 - 1132.0800000000002] I would say they're all deposites so the

[1129.44 - 1134.8400000000001] natural language is too powerful indeed

[1132.08 - 1136.34] I can say whatever kind of concept I'll

[1134.84 - 1138.1999999999998] ask that as it could be in natural

[1136.34 - 1140.4189999999999] language and explain it to you

[1138.2 - 1143.3600000000001] so the problem is exactly this one if

[1140.419 - 1146.48] you want to translate a communication so

[1143.36 - 1148.3999999999999] a a movement of information from an

[1146.48 - 1150.16] engine to another one from an agent to

[1148.4 - 1153.14] the centralized system whatever

[1150.16 - 1158.02] we need to be sure that we understand

[1153.14 - 1160.3400000000001] each other and in the context of

[1158.02 - 1162.26] Concepts which are known so when we

[1160.34 - 1163.8799999999999] communicate say as human natural

[1162.26 - 1166.76] language for example

[1163.88 - 1168.44] uh we need to know two things we need to

[1166.76 - 1169.94] speak the same language both English

[1168.44 - 1171.8600000000001] speaker for example

[1169.94 - 1173.8400000000001] but also we need to have the same

[1171.86 - 1175.6999999999998] conceptualization of the world so we

[1173.84 - 1177.08] have to not only to understand English

[1175.7 - 1180.32] but you have to understand the meaning

[1177.08 - 1182.4189999999999] of words when I say elephant I want I

[1180.32 - 1184.52] need you to be sure that you know what

[1182.419 - 1187.16] an elephant means maybe if you are a

[1184.52 - 1190.16] child that never left your your village

[1187.16 - 1191.96] whatever in Northern Carolina then maybe

[1190.16 - 1193.64] you never you never seen an elephant

[1191.96 - 1195.08] maybe you never know you don't even know

[1193.64 - 1197.179] what an elephant is so it's not only a

[1195.08 - 1199.76] problem of knowing English is having

[1197.179 - 1203.3600000000001] Concepts Associated to words

[1199.76 - 1205.8799999999999] and if you talk if you put a an agent

[1203.36 - 1209.539] which is a computer in in this game

[1205.88 - 1211.5200000000002] of course I may try to teach the

[1209.539 - 1213.32] computer the grammar the language the

[1211.52 - 1215.299] English language for example it's very

[1213.32 - 1218.8999999999999] hard because it's uh there are so many

[1215.299 - 1220.7] variations but the heartbeat is to be

[1218.9 - 1223.2800000000002] sure that the computer the agent

[1220.7 - 1226.46] understands the concepts and for example

[1223.28 - 1229.96] this is the major limitation of language

[1226.46 - 1232.76] models in in AI based on neural networks

[1229.96 - 1235.22] nowadays like gpt3 and stuff so they

[1232.76 - 1237.98] they circumvent the problem of the

[1235.22 - 1240.74] complexity of lung of the syntax of the

[1237.98 - 1243.46] fact that that the language is very many

[1240.74 - 1245.539] things can be seen as many many any any

[1243.46 - 1247.88] concept from the express is many more

[1245.539 - 1249.44] different in many different ways and and

[1247.88 - 1252.14] it's very hard to enumerate all of them

[1249.44 - 1254.24] so what gpt3 does and all this language

[1252.14 - 1255.44] natural language models based on deep

[1254.24 - 1258.6200000000001] learning AI

[1255.44 - 1259.6000000000001] uh they were just digest all the

[1258.62 - 1262.2399999999998] possible

[1259.6 - 1264.74] sentences ever uttered on the internet

[1262.24 - 1266.6] so that statistically they they

[1264.74 - 1268.76] basically get an idea on how the

[1266.6 - 1270.559] language is built but the major

[1268.76 - 1273.3799999999999] limitation which is a center of very

[1270.559 - 1277.34] interesting debate in AI with Gary Marks

[1273.38 - 1279.679] and stuff is what what the computer

[1277.34 - 1282.3799999999999] understands about the concepts which are

[1279.679 - 1285.6200000000001] embedded in the words so you can connect

[1282.38 - 1288.0200000000002] words in apparently meaningful sentences

[1285.62 - 1290.8999999999999] because they resonate well to our

[1288.02 - 1292.1589999999999] cognition but they they really the agent

[1290.9 - 1295.2800000000002] would never understand exactly the

[1292.159 - 1298.5200000000002] content so that's why when we deal with

[1295.28 - 1301.6399999999999] natural language we have to focus on

[1298.52 - 1303.559] on meaningful fragments of it so we we

[1301.64 - 1307.419] will never allow complete natural

[1303.559 - 1310.58] language freely spoken

[1307.419 - 1312.38] so because we want to be certain that we

[1310.58 - 1314.8999999999999] understand hundred percent

[1312.38 - 1317.919] of what any agent or any of the million

[1314.9 - 1323.1200000000001] ages is going to say so this means that

[1317.919 - 1325.039] the the computer eventually the the say

[1323.12 - 1327.3799999999999] the software that controls

[1325.039 - 1329.72] um Tau this communication which is also

[1327.38 - 1331.46] generated by discussion in Tau Etc but

[1329.72 - 1334.34] this is not the story but we have to be

[1331.46 - 1336.679] sure that the definition the meaning of

[1334.34 - 1338.4189999999999] all the concepts and the words is

[1336.679 - 1341.48] present in the agent in the main agent

[1338.419 - 1343.22] itself and so this means that maybe at

[1341.48 - 1345.2] the beginning Tau will be very stupid

[1343.22 - 1347.3600000000001] we'll understand very few Concepts and

[1345.2 - 1350.179] the conversation among agents will teach

[1347.36 - 1352.34] the computer more Concepts but in the

[1350.179 - 1354.5] real sense right so definitions what is

[1352.34 - 1357.1399999999999] an elephant well is an animal that lives

[1354.5 - 1359.72] in some countries it's gray as a trunk

[1357.14 - 1361.88] whatever and then of course we'll we'll

[1359.72 - 1363.98] I don't know we will have some some

[1361.88 - 1366.3200000000002] notion about

[1363.98 - 1368.059] the object the concepts that people may

[1366.32 - 1370.3999999999999] want to talk about

[1368.059 - 1373.28] in this way we have realized we have

[1370.4 - 1375.02] limited the focus in communication to

[1373.28 - 1377.12] what we call what has been called what

[1375.02 - 1379.58] is called normally in in research and

[1377.12 - 1382.9399999999998] application computer science uh control

[1379.58 - 1385.82] natural language so we limit the syntax

[1382.94 - 1388.8200000000002] to be usable Enough by everybody so we

[1385.82 - 1390.1399999999999] cannot speak freely it's just like me as

[1388.82 - 1391.76] a foreigner not as a native English

[1390.14 - 1394.159] speaker I would speak English so I

[1391.76 - 1396.919] subject verb object right it's a very

[1394.159 - 1399.5] simple sentences not so simple but again

[1396.919 - 1400.8200000000002] somehow a language is sort of this

[1399.5 - 1402.38] International English that everybody

[1400.82 - 1403.34] would understand and would be able to

[1402.38 - 1405.88] use

[1403.34 - 1408.26] plus the fact that

[1405.88 - 1411.2] we understand all the words all the

[1408.26 - 1414.02] concepts that are embedded in this uh in

[1411.2 - 1416.539] this in this natural language so uh

[1414.02 - 1418.22] somehow unlike we were saying is the

[1416.539 - 1421.96] limitation of the natural language that

[1418.22 - 1421.96] is unlimited and we want to limit

[1422.419 - 1429.2] yes yeah so the the because it's so

[1426.5 - 1430.94] powerful you and you introduce problems

[1429.2 - 1432.679] like the the flexibility is

[1430.94 - 1434.1200000000001] computationally difficult but also the

[1432.679 - 1436.3400000000001] ambiguity

[1434.12 - 1439.039] um is a major problem of not just syntax

[1436.34 - 1441.799] but the meaning of individual words and

[1439.039 - 1444.799] um and and Ohad I remember

[1441.799 - 1447.32] um you had mentioned previously

[1444.799 - 1449.78] um the the mathematical aspect of

[1447.32 - 1451.46] language versus controlled language

[1449.78 - 1453.98] um would you would you like to add a

[1451.46 - 1456.32] little bit to uh what Professor franconi

[1453.98 - 1459.32] just just shared

[1456.32 - 1459.32] and

[1459.44 - 1465.74] maybe just one thing because Professor

[1462.86 - 1470.36] Franklin basically covered the log and

[1465.74 - 1473.48] which is the concept of decidability

[1470.36 - 1475.28] that is the question

[1473.48 - 1477.679] when you have

[1475.28 - 1480.799] a computational task

[1477.679 - 1484.8200000000002] for example the task for finding a

[1480.799 - 1488.6] contradiction among statements

[1484.82 - 1490.3999999999999] it turns out that there are many many

[1488.6 - 1493.3999999999999] computational tasks

[1490.4 - 1495.38] that cannot be solved in finite time

[1493.4 - 1499.48] they need infinite time

[1495.38 - 1499.48] to be correct those taxes be correct

[1499.78 - 1504.2] because you can do a finite computation

[1502.159 - 1505.6000000000001] and be incorrect right

[1504.2 - 1509.44] yes

[1505.6 - 1509.4399999999998] and and

[1509.72 - 1513.98] in this case is called undecidability

[1511.82 - 1516.6399999999999] the things that you cannot solve in

[1513.98 - 1516.64] finite time

[1517.46 - 1521.14] now

[1519.14 - 1521.14] um

[1521.2 - 1527.72] what people in the field of logic do

[1524.48 - 1530.059] they Define languages and they ask

[1527.72 - 1532.24] whether determining

[1530.059 - 1535.279] whether any statement in this language

[1532.24 - 1538.1] contains a contradiction is decidable or

[1535.279 - 1539.6] not and then if yes then you call the

[1538.1 - 1541.8799999999999] whole language decide the bell and if

[1539.6 - 1544.039] not you call it undecidable

[1541.88 - 1546.679] it turns out that even very simple

[1544.039 - 1548.779] languages are already undecidable

[1546.679 - 1549.74] for example

[1548.779 - 1552.14] um

[1549.74 - 1553.64] the language of arithmetic the natural

[1552.14 - 1555.44] numbers one to three with addition

[1553.64 - 1558.88] multiplication

[1555.44 - 1558.88] is already on the side open

[1559.1 - 1563.299] okay this was this is the famous

[1561.08 - 1565.039] Gathering completeness building from a

[1563.299 - 1566.9] hundred years ago

[1566.9 - 1572.539] there is the trade-off between

[1569.559 - 1574.1589999999999] expressiveness and decidability the more

[1572.539 - 1576.74] you are able to sing the language the

[1574.159 - 1578.419] less recyclable it becomes

[1576.74 - 1580.22] and in particular natural language

[1578.419 - 1581.72] because we can express arithmetic

[1580.22 - 1585.7] natural language and of course natural

[1581.72 - 1585.7] languages and decidable

[1586.94 - 1593.179] there is another problem which

[1589.88 - 1596.1200000000001] which is about consistency

[1593.179 - 1598.88] some languages can

[1596.12 - 1600.6789999999999] um contain a contradiction in the very

[1598.88 - 1603.44] definition of the language or let's say

[1600.679 - 1606.5] you can construct sentences that are not

[1603.44 - 1608.299] true and not false

[1606.5 - 1609.32] any natural language you can do so

[1608.299 - 1611.4189999999999] indeed

[1609.32 - 1614.059] maybe that's a typical example is the

[1611.419 - 1615.8600000000001] liar paradox

[1614.059 - 1618.2] the sentence that cannot be true and

[1615.86 - 1620.059] cannot be false

[1618.2 - 1622.159] so you want a language that is

[1620.059 - 1625.3999999999999] consistent

[1622.159 - 1628.1000000000001] and is decidable

[1625.4 - 1630.74] in the programming language World there

[1628.1 - 1632.84] is the concept of curing completeness

[1630.74 - 1636.02] a language that can express anything

[1632.84 - 1640.299] that the theoretical construction of

[1636.02 - 1640.299] what is called the turing machine can do

[1641.48 - 1648.919] and indeed programming languages try on

[1645.98 - 1651.98] purpose to beat you incomplete and for

[1648.919 - 1655.279] people who remember how ethereum began

[1651.98 - 1658.76] their main

[1655.279 - 1662.919] goal was to have Smart contracts in a

[1658.76 - 1662.919] language which is during complete

[1663.46 - 1667.22] but

[1665.179 - 1668.659] during complete languages are

[1667.22 - 1671.6000000000001] undecidable

[1668.659 - 1673.5800000000002] the task of asking questions

[1671.6 - 1676.8799999999999] about statements including complete

[1673.58 - 1679.279] languages in particular asking whether

[1676.88 - 1682.1000000000001] two programs will return the same output

[1679.279 - 1684.76] but the two problems are equivalent is

[1682.1 - 1684.76] undecidable

[1685.46 - 1688.1000000000001] now

[1687.08 - 1691.34] um

[1688.1 - 1692.9599999999998] one thing that sometimes people neglect

[1691.34 - 1696.3799999999999] is that

[1692.96 - 1698.1200000000001] you don't need to be curing complete

[1696.38 - 1701.679] if you need your incompleteness no more

[1698.12 - 1701.6789999999999] than I need shampoo

[1701.72 - 1707.419] because

[1703.82 - 1710.5] Turing machines they are mathematically

[1707.419 - 1713.24] equivalent to ordinary computers

[1710.5 - 1715.34] completely except one point

[1713.24 - 1716.779] they have infinite memory

[1715.34 - 1719.12] are equivalent to computers with

[1716.779 - 1722.299] infinite memory

[1719.12 - 1725.4399999999998] so you are never going to have real

[1722.299 - 1725.44] Turing machines anyway

[1725.539 - 1729.679] and taking the example of arithmetic I

[1728.36 - 1732.74] said before

[1729.679 - 1735.919] there are Infinity many numbers

[1732.74 - 1737.779] but guess what only mathematicians care

[1735.919 - 1740.9] that there are infinitely many numbers

[1737.779 - 1743.12] there are but no one cares physics

[1740.9 - 1744.6200000000001] physicists don't need them programmers

[1743.12 - 1746.2399999999998] don't need them no one cares that there

[1744.62 - 1748.279] are Infinity many numbers when did you

[1746.24 - 1750.44] ever run out of numbers

[1748.279 - 1753.38] you don't care

[1750.44 - 1755.6000000000001] you don't need it it is true that there

[1753.38 - 1757.779] are infinitely novels but you don't need

[1755.6 - 1757.779] it

[1759.159 - 1765.74] I'm not going to say that the way we

[1762.679 - 1767.6000000000001] achieve the side ability is by limiting

[1765.74 - 1770.0] The Machine's memory or by assuming

[1767.6 - 1771.4399999999998] finitely many numbers we are doing it

[1770.0 - 1774.62] differently we achieve the side ability

[1771.44 - 1776.96] while maintaining the infinite

[1774.62 - 1780.9189999999999] but I am pointing out

[1776.96 - 1782.8400000000001] that you don't need to go to undecidable

[1780.919 - 1784.5800000000002] languages

[1782.84 - 1787.82] stay within the set of languages and

[1784.58 - 1790.9399999999998] enjoy the decidability of being able to

[1787.82 - 1793.399] get answers to your questions

[1790.94 - 1796.94] another way to put it

[1793.399 - 1800.12] there is an algorithm that gives answers

[1796.94 - 1803.779] to questions and decidability one way to

[1800.12 - 1806.4189999999999] say it is to say there is no algorithm

[1803.779 - 1808.52] you want languages with algorithms that

[1806.419 - 1810.88] tell you whether something is true or

[1808.52 - 1810.8799999999999] false

[1812.899 - 1818.059] Yeah by by just uh

[1815.899 - 1820.12] picking another side of the argument of

[1818.059 - 1822.74] Ohad

[1820.12 - 1824.779] this is important to have a decidable

[1822.74 - 1827.6] language with an algorithm that actually

[1824.779 - 1829.159] exists and then terminates which has to

[1827.6 - 1832.1589999999999] be correct so in all the notion of

[1829.159 - 1834.6200000000001] disadability is based on the fact you

[1832.159 - 1838.0390000000002] want an algorithm that does exactly

[1834.62 - 1840.08] finds exactly a solution to your problem

[1838.039 - 1842.24] and and maybe for that particular

[1840.08 - 1845.299] problem such an argument terminates

[1842.24 - 1847.58] doesn't exist so now now we want to have

[1845.299 - 1848.96] decidable languages anomaly that the

[1847.58 - 1851.72] language for which such angle

[1848.96 - 1854.779] determinates exists and this argument

[1851.72 - 1856.88] has to find the the right the correct

[1854.779 - 1859.64] answer to your problem and the only way

[1856.88 - 1861.2] to do that is not to let programmers in

[1859.64 - 1863.3600000000001] a software house to build these programs

[1861.2 - 1865.46] but always determinate but to employ

[1863.36 - 1869.24] mathematicians logicians

[1865.46 - 1871.76] that generates algorithms with together

[1869.24 - 1873.559] with a mathematical proof that this

[1871.76 - 1875.72] argument does do the right thing and

[1873.559 - 1878.1789999999999] this algories terminate and exactly with

[1875.72 - 1880.58] the right answer so I go back to my very

[1878.179 - 1883.8200000000002] first statement about trust so if you

[1880.58 - 1885.1999999999998] employ logic in this whole Endeavor you

[1883.82 - 1887.539] actually guarantee that this the

[1885.2 - 1890.1200000000001] algorithms do the right thing there is a

[1887.539 - 1892.279] theorem proving that so you have not to

[1890.12 - 1895.6999999999998] worry about whatever the computer tells

[1892.279 - 1897.679] back to you moreover you can decide what

[1895.7 - 1901.1200000000001] the the process that the computer takes

[1897.679 - 1901.1200000000001] to give you an answer

[1902.059 - 1906.799] excellent thank you guys for that

[1904.34 - 1908.72] um that answer this these topics are so

[1906.799 - 1910.52] fascinating to me and and I think that

[1908.72 - 1911.84] they'll be fascinating to to our

[1910.52 - 1914.6] audience as well

[1911.84 - 1917.12] so we've we've set up two pillars right

[1914.6 - 1919.039] uh collaboration and consensus and the

[1917.12 - 1920.539] problems with that and then we've also

[1919.039 - 1922.94] talked about language controlled

[1920.539 - 1925.1589999999999] language uh decidability and and

[1922.94 - 1927.6200000000001] completeness versus incompleteness so

[1925.159 - 1930.0800000000002] now let's link the two conceptually how

[1927.62 - 1932.899] do how do the problems of

[1930.08 - 1936.02] um completeness or intractability relate

[1932.899 - 1938.84] to collaboration and consensus and this

[1936.02 - 1941.4189999999999] will also lead into Tao's Solutions how

[1938.84 - 1943.6999999999998] have you guys solved these problems and

[1941.419 - 1946.179] brought everything together Ohad would

[1943.7 - 1946.179] you like to start

[1946.539 - 1951.799] and yes in fact there is one big problem

[1949.64 - 1954.26] that we didn't speak about because the

[1951.799 - 1957.3799999999999] problems that we did speak about up

[1954.26 - 1959.72] until now have Solutions in the

[1957.38 - 1962.419] literature of mathematical Logic the

[1959.72 - 1964.22] other side of the languages and

[1962.419 - 1966.6200000000001] there are solutions

[1964.22 - 1968.419] but there is one big big problem that

[1966.62 - 1970.279] has no solution and we had to invent the

[1968.419 - 1972.679] solution

[1970.279 - 1975.5] and the problem is

[1972.679 - 1978.94] a language that can speak about truth of

[1975.5 - 1978.94] other sentences in the language

[1978.98 - 1983.659] the logicians proved that in a certain

[1981.799 - 1986.059] form

[1983.659 - 1988.5800000000002] and such a language cannot be consistent

[1986.059 - 1992.98] it must contain a contradiction this is

[1988.58 - 1992.98] called tarsky's undefinability of Truth

[1993.58 - 2000.22] but there is

[1996.32 - 2001.6] a serious real-life need in being able

[2000.22 - 2004.659] to do so

[2001.6 - 2005.6789999999999] so we need to find we needed to find a

[2004.659 - 2008.5] way

[2005.679 - 2010.0] to have maybe a more limited setting not

[2008.5 - 2012.1] exactly the setting the task he

[2010.0 - 2015.72] considered but still allowing us to

[2012.1 - 2015.7199999999998] speak about rules of other sentences

[2015.94 - 2022.0] and this we can relate it to with two

[2020.2 - 2024.76] examples to

[2022.0 - 2029.98] well maybe three examples to blockchain

[2024.76 - 2032.019] to Ai and to real world law

[2029.98 - 2033.7] so we spoke about

[2032.019 - 2035.019] blockchain that is controlled by its

[2033.7 - 2039.22] users

[2035.019 - 2043.659] taking it more down to earth

[2039.22 - 2046.8990000000001] so in each block you are gonna have

[2043.659 - 2051.159] the code of the network itself a

[2046.899 - 2054.22] definition of what the network should do

[2051.159 - 2055.179] the whole point in blockchain is a

[2054.22 - 2057.8199999999997] condition

[2055.179 - 2060.0] of accepting or rejecting a proposed

[2057.82 - 2060.0] block

[2060.339 - 2064.2999999999997] but for example in proof of world you

[2062.08 - 2067.02] accept it if the harsh satisfy certain

[2064.3 - 2067.02] conditions

[2068.139 - 2073.839] but if the code contains if the block

[2071.44 - 2075.399] contains statement of the

[2073.839 - 2077.32] them

[2075.399 - 2079.359] Network itself

[2077.32 - 2081.159] and the current Network need to speak

[2079.359 - 2083.919] about this

[2081.159 - 2085.48] those statements ask questions about

[2083.919 - 2086.859] those statements all in the same

[2085.48 - 2089.679] language otherwise you're going to need

[2086.859 - 2092.5] Infinity many languages

[2089.679 - 2094.839] and get an answer

[2092.5 - 2097.599] so that's a blockchain example

[2094.839 - 2099.82] take an AI example there are the three

[2097.599 - 2101.92] laws of robotics by Asimov

[2099.82 - 2104.1400000000003] that the robot will never harm humans

[2101.92 - 2105.88] and so on

[2104.14 - 2108.8199999999997] I say that you need a fourth law for

[2105.88 - 2111.28] boutiques which is that

[2108.82 - 2114.28] any future software update of the robot

[2111.28 - 2117.52] will also admit a lot of robotics

[2114.28 - 2119.619] you don't want to plug in a USB key to

[2117.52 - 2121.9] the robot with software update and it

[2119.619 - 2124.119] starts killing people you want the robot

[2121.9 - 2126.2200000000003] to reject this update if it does not

[2124.119 - 2128.38] admit the rules of robotics

[2126.22 - 2129.8199999999997] this is the same problem that the

[2128.38 - 2132.4] current field of mathematical logic

[2129.82 - 2134.7400000000002] cannot handle

[2132.4 - 2137.079] the update is written in the same

[2134.74 - 2139.4199999999996] language that the robot is written and

[2137.079 - 2141.3390000000004] you need the same language to ask

[2139.42 - 2144.2200000000003] whether another statement in that

[2141.339 - 2146.14] language is consistent

[2144.22 - 2147.5789999999997] with another statement being the laws of

[2146.14 - 2149.5789999999997] robotics

[2147.579 - 2149.579] um

[2149.8 - 2156.82] self example the law of changing the law

[2154.359 - 2159.7] you have law or height now you also need

[2156.82 - 2161.02] laws of changing the laws because if you

[2159.7 - 2164.339] don't have a lot of changing materials

[2161.02 - 2164.339] then either you cannot change them

[2164.92 - 2167.98] or

[2166.119 - 2169.48] there are no conditions of changing the

[2167.98 - 2171.099] law energize me English you can always

[2169.48 - 2174.04] change it

[2171.099 - 2176.1400000000003] so you need loss of changing the laws

[2174.04 - 2178.3] but then you are going to need

[2176.14 - 2179.6189999999997] laws of changing the laws of changing

[2178.3 - 2181.3] the laws

[2179.619 - 2183.2200000000003] because if you don't have lots of change

[2181.3 - 2184.42] with a lot of strange the laws then you

[2183.22 - 2186.52] cannot change the law of changing the

[2184.42 - 2188.14] law and so on

[2186.52 - 2190.599] so we are going to need infinitely many

[2188.14 - 2193.42] loss just to begin with

[2190.599 - 2195.88] what are we gonna do well

[2193.42 - 2199.44] you need the laws of changing the laws

[2195.88 - 2199.44] to refer also to themselves

[2199.96 - 2204.82] for example imagine Constitution that

[2203.32 - 2206.32] says

[2204.82 - 2209.82] if

[2206.32 - 2212.5] a proposed law

[2209.82 - 2215.5] contradicts the Constitution

[2212.5 - 2218.94] then it needs 60 majority otherwise it

[2215.5 - 2218.94] needs 50 majority

[2221.079 - 2225.099] those three examples are all about the

[2223.3 - 2227.26] same thing languages can speak about

[2225.099 - 2229.599] truth and contradiction of its own

[2227.26 - 2234.099] sentences

[2229.599 - 2237.04] and thus this was our biggest

[2234.099 - 2239.32] theoretical effort and we achieved that

[2237.04 - 2241.48] and then we have to move on to the

[2239.32 - 2243.099] second theoretical effort which is after

[2241.48 - 2246.52] we achieve that

[2243.099 - 2248.38] this is software it is a language has to

[2246.52 - 2250.24] be able to be a software specification

[2248.38 - 2251.92] language because we are all about

[2250.24 - 2255.06] software control by its users production

[2251.92 - 2255.06] controlled by its users

[2255.88 - 2260.32] it's not for specification language as

[2258.04 - 2261.64] are characterized by having a temporal

[2260.32 - 2265.56] dimension

[2261.64 - 2265.56] first do this then do that

[2266.8 - 2270.6400000000003] so we took us another

[2269.079 - 2272.98] quiet way

[2270.64 - 2274.839] to turn this language into a software

[2272.98 - 2277.38] specification language but we achieve

[2274.839 - 2277.38] that as well

[2278.079 - 2282.76] and that what what is that that is

[2280.78 - 2285.7000000000003] something you have actually achieved and

[2282.76 - 2290.26] is ready or nearly ready correct

[2285.7 - 2293.0789999999997] yes yes it is the the ready on paper

[2290.26 - 2294.579] and we are now implementing it luckily

[2293.079 - 2297.76] we don't need to implement it from

[2294.579 - 2300.52] scratch because we already implemented

[2297.76 - 2302.5600000000004] maybe all the Machinery necessary to

[2300.52 - 2305.44] implement this language

[2302.56 - 2306.88] and hopefully in the next month we can

[2305.44 - 2308.68] see fine

[2306.88 - 2310.2400000000002] excellent

[2308.68 - 2312.52] um yeah tell us a little bit more now

[2310.24 - 2315.04] that we've we've you've done such a

[2312.52 - 2316.599] great job of outlining the problems and

[2315.04 - 2318.52] now we're getting to the solutions that

[2316.599 - 2321.099] you that you've engineered and and and

[2318.52 - 2323.619] begun engineering and and implementing

[2321.099 - 2325.0] so let's delve in those um so some of

[2323.619 - 2326.98] the some of the solutions and I

[2325.0 - 2328.42] apologize if I miss them but some of the

[2326.98 - 2331.2400000000002] big solutions that you've come up with

[2328.42 - 2333.579] is the Tau language The Tao meta

[2331.24 - 2335.6189999999997] language and the Agora token so would

[2333.579 - 2337.54] you like to walk us through each of

[2335.619 - 2340.32] those Solutions and also any that I

[2337.54 - 2340.32] missed I apologize

[2341.64 - 2347.46] yeah so what I described now is the

[2344.98 - 2347.46] tower language

[2348.54 - 2353.92] it serves several purposes

[2351.52 - 2356.28] first it is a very powerful execution

[2353.92 - 2358.48] engine for logical tasks

[2356.28 - 2360.579] it is

[2358.48 - 2364.0] um in many senses equivalent to

[2360.579 - 2367.54] relational algebra relational algebra is

[2364.0 - 2369.76] the famous SQL that virtually all

[2367.54 - 2372.099] databases or SQL database or relational

[2369.76 - 2375.46] databases work with

[2372.099 - 2377.76] it is not SQL but there is a deep

[2375.46 - 2377.76] connection

[2377.8 - 2380.079] but

[2379.48 - 2381.2400000000002] um

[2380.079 - 2385.0600000000004] it

[2381.24 - 2387.2799999999997] implements relational algebra in in a

[2385.06 - 2390.7599999999998] compressed way

[2387.28 - 2393.1600000000003] and this kind of representation

[2390.76 - 2395.2000000000003] allows you to

[2393.16 - 2397.42] um to be a powerful logical solver by

[2395.2 - 2400.72] its own

[2397.42 - 2404.14] and the Technologies from tml will

[2400.72 - 2406.6189999999997] indeed be used across all our logical

[2404.14 - 2406.6189999999997] tools

[2408.3 - 2413.8] is also and this gives it its name meta

[2412.54 - 2417.22] language

[2413.8 - 2419.44] is intended to be a compiler compiler a

[2417.22 - 2421.48] tool to write translators from one

[2419.44 - 2424.119] language to another

[2421.48 - 2426.72] so it contains a very powerful parser

[2424.119 - 2430.119] maybe the best passer

[2426.72 - 2433.06] that exists on the market

[2430.119 - 2436.7200000000003] and tools that allow you to take the

[2433.06 - 2440.64] past three and manipulate it

[2436.72 - 2440.64] and by that great translators

[2440.98 - 2448.0] so to sum up tmn main three things is a

[2446.02 - 2449.44] certain kind of database of compressed

[2448.0 - 2452.859] database

[2449.44 - 2456.94] that in certain tasks it is orders of

[2452.859 - 2459.0989999999997] magnitudes faster than other databases

[2456.94 - 2461.28] second is a powerful execution engine

[2459.099 - 2464.2200000000003] which also incorporates both

[2461.28 - 2467.8] execution I will explain it in a moment

[2464.22 - 2470.74] and language for writing translators now

[2467.8 - 2474.96] for proof of execution

[2470.74 - 2474.9599999999996] that's something that we walk on

[2475.359 - 2480.0989999999997] if if I

[2478.119 - 2481.9] if you give me a program you ask me to

[2480.099 - 2485.38] run the program let's let's say the

[2481.9 - 2486.82] program we can say so no let's say

[2485.38 - 2488.5] um so I come back to you I tell you the

[2486.82 - 2491.079] program returned yes

[2488.5 - 2492.579] how do you know I didn't make it up how

[2491.079 - 2495.54] do you know I really

[2492.579 - 2495.54] end the program

[2499.119 - 2504.7000000000003] in absolute sense there is no way to

[2502.54 - 2506.2599999999998] convince accept something that is

[2504.7 - 2508.54] equivalent for you running the program

[2506.26 - 2510.6600000000003] yourself again

[2508.54 - 2512.8] but then what's the point

[2510.66 - 2515.2] then we could just run it without giving

[2512.8 - 2518.7400000000002] it away

[2515.2 - 2520.1189999999997] turns out that other under cryptographic

[2518.74 - 2523.0] assumptions

[2520.119 - 2525.339] I can give you a cryptographic proof

[2523.0 - 2527.38] that dialing was correct

[2525.339 - 2529.66] the cryptographic means it's not a

[2527.38 - 2531.9] logical proof but it is a very hard to

[2529.66 - 2531.8999999999996] fake

[2533.579 - 2540.6400000000003] so why don't you say that everywhere

[2537.339 - 2543.16] why you cannot write now give program to

[2540.64 - 2546.339] other people and get

[2543.16 - 2548.859] a cryptographic certificate well

[2546.339 - 2552.099] because it requires to convert the

[2548.859 - 2555.5789999999997] program into a very specific form

[2552.099 - 2559.06] and that's a big headache

[2555.579 - 2561.46] and in tml because it is converted to

[2559.06 - 2564.099] the binary decision diagram form it is

[2561.46 - 2565.96] already in the form that suits this kind

[2564.099 - 2568.1800000000003] of algorithm

[2565.96 - 2570.4] so for tml program you are able to give

[2568.18 - 2572.74] a short certificate

[2570.4 - 2575.8] and this gives rise to

[2572.74 - 2577.319] important blockchain feature

[2575.8 - 2580.0600000000004] foreign

[2577.319 - 2581.98] existing blockchain networks with smart

[2580.06 - 2582.52] contracts

[2581.98 - 2585.099] um

[2582.52 - 2587.2] all nodes in the network need to earn

[2585.099 - 2588.9] the smart contracts as part of the block

[2587.2 - 2591.7599999999998] verification process

[2588.9 - 2593.44] so the computational capacity of the

[2591.76 - 2597.3] whole network

[2593.44 - 2597.3] is as of one home computer

[2597.339 - 2604.359] and all the work is repeated

[2599.98 - 2606.94] why not one node runs the contracts and

[2604.359 - 2609.64] supplies proof to the other nodes

[2606.94 - 2611.7400000000002] that this is the correct answer

[2609.64 - 2613.24] and that's indeed yet another aspect of

[2611.74 - 2615.3999999999996] how

[2613.24 - 2619.14] the proof of execution of contracts all

[2615.4 - 2619.14] things in or other things in general

[2620.14 - 2627.46] and so the town metal language is what

[2623.56 - 2630.16] enables this distribution of not just

[2627.46 - 2632.5] computation but also the proofs

[2630.16 - 2635.44] um and then and that that relates to the

[2632.5 - 2637.42] logic and the trust so uh Professor

[2635.44 - 2639.94] franconi earlier you mentioned how do

[2637.42 - 2642.579] you how do you trust right how do you

[2639.94 - 2645.339] how do you arrive at that uh at that

[2642.579 - 2647.079] place where there's agreement

[2645.339 - 2649.72] um and that's that's a bit of what Ohad

[2647.079 - 2654.28] is mentioning what is what is your uh

[2649.72 - 2655.9599999999996] your take or uh reaction to some of

[2654.28 - 2658.1800000000003] those some of the solutions that you

[2655.96 - 2659.44] guys have come up with with the Tao meta

[2658.18 - 2661.1189999999997] language

[2659.44 - 2665.44] uh well

[2661.119 - 2669.099] if I can go back with other examples or

[2665.44 - 2671.98] I'd mentioned SQL and tml an assembling

[2669.099 - 2674.079] SQL and based with uh this very powerful

[2671.98 - 2681.66] data structures Etc

[2674.079 - 2681.6600000000003] so SQL database technology is basically

[2683.16 - 2689.2] making a business of 17 percent of all

[2686.14 - 2691.48] ID so 70 of all ID money goes to

[2689.2 - 2693.3999999999996] relational database technology that's

[2691.48 - 2694.48] what companies do that's what is really

[2693.4 - 2696.64] needed

[2694.48 - 2700.839] and

[2696.64 - 2702.0] Banks use SQL Technologies and and Banks

[2700.839 - 2705.16] don't want

[2702.0 - 2707.38] their technology to fail they want their

[2705.16 - 2709.2999999999997] systems to always tell the truth about

[2707.38 - 2710.8] how much money do they have and how much

[2709.3 - 2711.94] money do they have to give to other

[2710.8 - 2714.46] people and so on and so forth

[2711.94 - 2717.88] transaction have to be transferred

[2714.46 - 2720.04] now SQL is based on logic so SQL

[2717.88 - 2724.839] technology is logic it's personal logic

[2720.04 - 2727.9] is when it was created in the early 70s

[2724.839 - 2730.48] it was created as a formal system

[2727.9 - 2732.52] and SQL is a language where you can

[2730.48 - 2734.26] actually access the data and update the

[2732.52 - 2737.04] data and manage the data

[2734.26 - 2740.44] and it's all based on on the notion that

[2737.04 - 2742.839] the answer is always to any query or the

[2740.44 - 2744.76] impact of any update the data is always

[2742.839 - 2746.5] trustable because there are formal

[2744.76 - 2748.9] proofs mathematical proofs that tells

[2746.5 - 2751.44] you that that's one aspect and well I

[2748.9 - 2754.839] have this joke they always make that

[2751.44 - 2757.119] even Microsoft but these are a joke that

[2754.839 - 2759.46] is good for people of my age

[2757.119 - 2761.859] when Microsoft was just a nightmare

[2759.46 - 2764.8] right with Windows crashing all the time

[2761.859 - 2766.18] etc etc and then then you would say you

[2764.8 - 2768.52] and

[2766.18 - 2771.819] the question is how comes that Microsoft

[2768.52 - 2773.8] as a reliable uh related SQL relational

[2771.819 - 2776.68] engine this is SQL Server which is very

[2773.8 - 2779.26] popular still nowadays it always gets

[2776.68 - 2781.0] the correct answer so it never fails why

[2779.26 - 2784.0200000000004] is that because well Microsoft have to

[2781.0 - 2788.079] implement SQL their own SQL Server

[2784.02 - 2790.24] engine by following The Logical rules

[2788.079 - 2793.3] and they could not do anything else so

[2790.24 - 2796.1189999999997] that's that's why another example joke

[2793.3 - 2798.1600000000003] that involves Microsoft is would you

[2796.119 - 2800.5] trust an airplane which is run by

[2798.16 - 2803.44] Windows would you ever fly on that

[2800.5 - 2805.9] airplane well probably not but you do

[2803.44 - 2807.64] fly on airplanes why because the soft so

[2805.9 - 2811.06] we are not so the software in Airplane

[2807.64 - 2813.7599999999998] has not been by Tau but still there is a

[2811.06 - 2816.52] major technology which uses logic to

[2813.76 - 2818.619] verify the correctness of programs in

[2816.52 - 2821.619] complex systems in safety critical

[2818.619 - 2824.619] systems like Railways airplanes and

[2821.619 - 2826.78] stuff so you you can transform your

[2824.619 - 2828.2200000000003] program in some logical form your

[2826.78 - 2831.4] software in some logical form and then

[2828.22 - 2834.0989999999997] you ask to Theory improvers uh questions

[2831.4 - 2835.9] something like it will ever be possible

[2834.099 - 2838.839] that in sometimes in the future there

[2835.9 - 2841.359] will be a configuration of labs engines

[2838.839 - 2842.98] air conditioning whatever failing

[2841.359 - 2844.48] batteries and stuff so that at some

[2842.98 - 2846.94] point this airplane will fall down

[2844.48 - 2848.92] because of the software of course you

[2846.94 - 2850.42] want this the answer to be no but you

[2848.92 - 2851.6800000000003] want to trust this answer you want to

[2850.42 - 2854.6800000000003] ask this question

[2851.68 - 2857.68] and you want to ask to trust the answer

[2854.68 - 2860.2599999999998] by by the system that gives that that

[2857.68 - 2862.2999999999997] tries to to answer this question and the

[2860.26 - 2865.0] system are based on logic they do logic

[2862.3 - 2868.48] based software verification which is a

[2865.0 - 2872.4] very small part we also do this this is

[2868.48 - 2872.4] somehow similar to the idea of

[2872.619 - 2878.079] of proof that was talking was said by a

[2876.28 - 2879.7000000000003] lot before but it's it's very limited to

[2878.079 - 2882.88] that particular contest

[2879.7 - 2885.5789999999997] so the notion of trust is what logic

[2882.88 - 2888.1600000000003] gives you for free and another example

[2885.579 - 2890.319] that it's what what is why logic is that

[2888.16 - 2892.06] I would I would claim the logic is the

[2890.319 - 2895.24] only thing that gives you that

[2892.06 - 2898.14] it's uh well when we communicate and we

[2895.24 - 2900.9399999999996] start to argue about one something

[2898.14 - 2902.56] we may argue as much as you wish but

[2900.94 - 2904.42] there are some things that I may say

[2902.56 - 2906.7] that you can never counter argue right

[2904.42 - 2908.44] there is no way that you cannot trust

[2906.7 - 2911.46] what I say because I'm following a

[2908.44 - 2914.64] logical argumentation and following some

[2911.46 - 2918.28] patterns of reasoning which are

[2914.64 - 2919.72] necessarily correct right and then of

[2918.28 - 2921.6400000000003] course there are ways they can fool you

[2919.72 - 2925.359] so I can

[2921.64 - 2927.5789999999997] um I can build an argumentation that is

[2925.359 - 2929.98] not really correct in terms of logical

[2927.579 - 2932.319] steps but you don't fully understand it

[2929.98 - 2933.64] because I confuse you with words

[2932.319 - 2936.2799999999997] Etc and so you believe that the

[2933.64 - 2939.16] argumentation is correct right and the

[2936.28 - 2940.8390000000004] point is logic is exactly the study on

[2939.16 - 2943.0] which kind of reasoning paths are

[2940.839 - 2946.24] corrected which not so once you have

[2943.0 - 2949.0] done this study you can build the ideal

[2946.24 - 2951.339] discussion in any discussion or you can

[2949.0 - 2954.099] build a logical Theory improver a

[2951.339 - 2956.5] logical system that that guarantee that

[2954.099 - 2959.44] whatever thing you ask them it's it's

[2956.5 - 2962.319] correct and you cannot really disagree

[2959.44 - 2965.44] with it so that's the notion of of why

[2962.319 - 2967.839] this is random logic

[2965.44 - 2971.079] excellent thank you for that it's always

[2967.839 - 2972.819] oh go ahead odd I I need the one maybe

[2971.079 - 2975.599] go take the charger

[2972.819 - 2975.599] excuse me

[2979.96 - 2985.42] let's see I don't think we can stop or

[2982.9 - 2986.859] pause the uh the the video I can stop it

[2985.42 - 2989.14] but I don't want to have to restart so

[2986.859 - 2991.2] I'll just cut this one section out

[2989.14 - 2991.2] um

[2991.599 - 2997.6600000000003] uh but yeah uh this is this is great you

[2994.9 - 2999.52] guys are are really phenomenal um at

[2997.66 - 3001.6189999999997] explaining these

[2999.52 - 3004.38] um and we're building up to

[3001.619 - 3006.0] we're building up to the um one of the

[3004.38 - 3008.88] key points um so what I'm going to ask

[3006.0 - 3011.22] next is about how does how does the Tau

[3008.88 - 3014.099] meta language help with building the

[3011.22 - 3016.5] software and translating meaning between

[3014.099 - 3018.3] languages whether it's natural language

[3016.5 - 3020.7] or controlled language or you know

[3018.3 - 3023.6400000000003] machine language and how does that also

[3020.7 - 3025.56] relate to software specifications

[3023.64 - 3027.66] um because that's that's kind of the

[3025.56 - 3030.7799999999997] heart of what Tau the Tau Network

[3027.66 - 3032.46] produces right that's the output or if

[3030.78 - 3034.44] you disagree that's

[3032.46 - 3036.48] um I'm curious to how like how would you

[3034.44 - 3038.099] define the output of the town now I

[3036.48 - 3039.72] guess that the metaphor the way I

[3038.099 - 3042.54] understand because I'm just in part of

[3039.72 - 3044.64] it tml is the assembler of the old

[3042.54 - 3046.2599999999998] Endeavor so there is this these high

[3044.64 - 3048.42] level languages like what this could be

[3046.26 - 3050.8190000000004] the control natural language but or the

[3048.42 - 3052.619] Tau language itself then then is

[3050.819 - 3056.339] executed over tml

[3052.619 - 3057.839] so it's uh it can be understood as such

[3056.339 - 3059.88] you can do whatever you want of course

[3057.839 - 3062.04] it's very low level so the thing that

[3059.88 - 3064.6800000000003] you can do in tml have to be very

[3062.04 - 3066.42] specific and again it is guaranteed that

[3064.68 - 3069.24] whatever it does it does it correctly

[3066.42 - 3070.8] but it's it's too fine grained right

[3069.24 - 3073.4399999999996] somehow

[3070.8 - 3075.599] then tau is a much more abstract

[3073.44 - 3078.42] language and it's much closer to the

[3075.599 - 3080.52] cognition of people using them so they

[3078.42 - 3083.819] are the notion of Concepts and relations

[3080.52 - 3086.46] and then and Transitions and programs

[3083.819 - 3090.42] so that you can actually

[3086.46 - 3092.099] express your your consonant software in

[3090.42 - 3094.44] the tower that then will be compiled

[3092.099 - 3096.059] into email that's my understanding but

[3094.44 - 3097.859] probably oh and there's a better way to

[3096.059 - 3100.3190000000004] say it

[3097.859 - 3103.14] yeah well The Tao language is also very

[3100.319 - 3105.599] low level yes okay but it's more idea to

[3103.14 - 3108.66] make it I guess

[3105.599 - 3110.94] even more yes yeah

[3108.66 - 3113.5789999999997] the layer to convert from control

[3110.94 - 3116.46] natural language or natural language

[3113.579 - 3118.559] to the Tau language that would be a

[3116.46 - 3123.0] different layer

[3118.559 - 3125.4] but our language had to overcome the

[3123.0 - 3127.92] theoretical difficulties of speaking

[3125.4 - 3129.839] about rules of sentences in the same

[3127.92 - 3131.7000000000003] language and having the temporal

[3129.839 - 3133.5] Dimension to allow it to be sort of

[3131.7 - 3135.48] specification language

[3133.5 - 3138.48] and it achieves this in a mathematical

[3135.48 - 3141.3] way if you see that our language

[3138.48 - 3144.48] it will make little sense to you because

[3141.3 - 3146.28] it is a mathematical thing

[3144.48 - 3148.26] but you can

[3146.28 - 3151.2200000000003] build on top of it something that

[3148.26 - 3151.2200000000003] relates to real life

[3153.72 - 3158.4599999999996] so by building

[3155.66 - 3160.319] what I guess uh can you expand on that

[3158.46 - 3161.94] like building building something on top

[3160.319 - 3163.2] of the Tau language the town metal

[3161.94 - 3164.46] language

[3163.2 - 3168.1189999999997] um how does that how does that connect

[3164.46 - 3170.88] to the original purpose of Tau which was

[3168.119 - 3172.319] that collaboration the consensus and the

[3170.88 - 3174.1800000000003] construction of software in a

[3172.319 - 3177.18] decentralized manner because this is

[3174.18 - 3178.5] this is the the underlying

[3177.18 - 3180.0589999999997] um I don't want to say operating system

[3178.5 - 3182.4] because it's it's different but it's the

[3180.059 - 3185.28] underpinning technology that facilitates

[3182.4 - 3187.02] that correct that goal of distributed

[3185.28 - 3190.619] software development

[3187.02 - 3192.119] yes but there is one important point to

[3190.619 - 3196.28] understand here which is the difference

[3192.119 - 3196.28] between code and specification

[3198.0 - 3205.619] to give an example suppose you

[3203.16 - 3207.24] you're a new city you want to reach from

[3205.619 - 3211.38] point A to point B and you don't know

[3207.24 - 3213.9599999999996] how to how to do that so you ask someone

[3211.38 - 3216.559] and I tell you

[3213.96 - 3219.48] you go straight third

[3216.559 - 3220.92] turn to the right second third turn to

[3219.48 - 3223.319] the left and so on they don't tell you

[3220.92 - 3227.1800000000003] how many meters but I tell you the

[3223.319 - 3230.16] second third first term and so on

[3227.18 - 3231.5989999999997] and and you ask another one

[3230.16 - 3233.2799999999997] and they give you completely different

[3231.599 - 3236.339] directions

[3233.28 - 3238.6800000000003] that hopefully lead to the same place

[3236.339 - 3241.44] how can you compare and make sure that

[3238.68 - 3244.6189999999997] those two sets of instructions lead you

[3241.44 - 3247.28] to the same place well you cannot

[3244.619 - 3247.28] you cannot

[3249.119 - 3254.52] at the same way

[3250.92 - 3256.079] it is impossible to say that whether two

[3254.52 - 3257.94] programs are equivalent as we spoke

[3256.079 - 3259.8590000000004] before and programs are indeed

[3257.94 - 3263.42] instructions where the computer has to

[3259.859 - 3263.42] turn at each moment

[3263.7 - 3265.8799999999997] foreign

[3268.04 - 3274.079] specification the requirements level of

[3271.619 - 3277.6400000000003] different nature your requirement is to

[3274.079 - 3277.6400000000003] age 1.8 to 0.3

[3277.68 - 3283.0789999999997] and this is not written in the language

[3279.9 - 3285.059] of instructions you will need eventually

[3283.079 - 3288.8590000000004] to get the instructions

[3285.059 - 3288.8590000000004] but that's not what you really want

[3289.319 - 3292.5589999999997] software is still in the Stone Age In

[3291.48 - 3295.02] This sense

[3292.559 - 3297.0] you'll need to call the instructions

[3295.02 - 3300.0] why can't you

[3297.0 - 3302.78] like let your Google Maps calculate the

[3300.0 - 3302.78] instructions for you

[3302.819 - 3309.42] in the software analogy

[3305.22 - 3313.5789999999997] why can't you just write the word

[3309.42 - 3313.579] that the computer figure out the how

[3315.599 - 3322.079] another limitation of traditional coding

[3319.92 - 3325.6800000000003] is that

[3322.079 - 3327.8390000000004] you cannot have Global statements for

[3325.68 - 3330.0589999999997] example I don't know I want to reach

[3327.839 - 3331.5] somewhere and go to a supermarket in the

[3330.059 - 3334.8590000000004] middle

[3331.5 - 3337.5] or a more software example never send

[3334.859 - 3339.119] private data over the network

[3337.5 - 3341.339] never center with that over the network

[3339.119 - 3345.1800000000003] is not something you can code there is

[3341.339 - 3347.7] no command that says never do that

[3345.18 - 3350.339] you need to go over your whole code or

[3347.7 - 3352.0789999999997] places that you send data and or places

[3350.339 - 3354.119] that you declared data as private and

[3352.079 - 3356.2200000000003] make sure that all pipes are

[3354.119 - 3359.28] connected correctly

[3356.22 - 3361.4399999999996] why can't you say just you don't survive

[3359.28 - 3365.1800000000003] that over the report and that's it let's

[3361.44 - 3365.18] let it figure it out automatically

[3367.98 - 3370.88] another point

[3370.98 - 3376.619] if we take the two uh

[3374.46 - 3379.819] um directions instructions of how to

[3376.619 - 3379.819] reach one point A to point B

[3380.28 - 3385.2000000000003] you want to ask the question maybe

[3382.619 - 3386.579] download the same but where do they

[3385.2 - 3390.2599999999998] agree

[3386.579 - 3390.26] well that's a meaningless question

[3390.839 - 3395.4] but the same way if you have two

[3392.819 - 3397.98] different programs and ask where do

[3395.4 - 3401.42] those two programs agree

[3397.98 - 3401.42] that's a meaningless question

[3401.46 - 3405.96] but if you have two requirements

[3403.98 - 3409.099] then ask well those two requirements

[3405.96 - 3409.099] agree that's meaningful

[3411.359 - 3417.359] the way to see the mathematical way that

[3413.88 - 3419.88] we look at it is each requirement is

[3417.359 - 3422.839] really the set of all programs that meet

[3419.88 - 3422.839] those requirements

[3423.619 - 3428.48] is mathematically the set of all

[3425.88 - 3428.48] programs

[3431.94 - 3435.3] and then you come up with another

[3433.26 - 3437.579] requirement and which will be another

[3435.3 - 3441.8] set and the agreement would be any

[3437.579 - 3441.8] program that is in both sets

[3442.079 - 3449.42] so we have to move from programs

[3445.98 - 3449.42] to sets of programs

[3449.7 - 3456.2999999999997] and to your question how

[3452.839 - 3459.599] coordination takes place indeed

[3456.3 - 3461.2200000000003] so every everyone can say whatever they

[3459.599 - 3463.8590000000004] want to say about the software like

[3461.22 - 3468.0789999999997] levels and public data over the network

[3463.859 - 3471.24] and we look for programs that meet

[3468.079 - 3474.119] everyone's requirements

[3471.24 - 3476.4599999999996] if everyone each user would come up with

[3474.119 - 3478.38] the whole program then you ask where to

[3476.46 - 3480.92] programs agree as we said that's

[3478.38 - 3480.92] meaningless

[3481.319 - 3486.42] cannot have programming by consensus

[3484.26 - 3487.619] programming by agreement which is what

[3486.42 - 3491.099] we do

[3487.619 - 3494.839] if you stick to code and programs you

[3491.099 - 3494.839] must move to the requirements level

[3499.92 - 3502.46] so

[3502.5 - 3507.559] tying it into layers and the procedures

[3508.14 - 3513.0589999999997] how do we get from

[3511.319 - 3516.24] discussing

[3513.059 - 3517.98] if I if I express my requirements you

[3516.24 - 3520.0789999999997] know don't send my data over the network

[3517.98 - 3522.119] as as one example and of course there's

[3520.079 - 3524.46] plenty plenty of requirements so a

[3522.119 - 3527.339] software requirement or specification is

[3524.46 - 3529.559] as you said the what not the how I tell

[3527.339 - 3532.319] I tell you what I want the outcome that

[3529.559 - 3535.26] I want to achieve so how do we get from

[3532.319 - 3537.24] me expressing that in English

[3535.26 - 3539.1600000000003] or any other French Italian German

[3537.24 - 3541.9799999999996] whatever any language how do we get from

[3539.16 - 3543.24] groups of people expressing that

[3541.98 - 3545.46] to

[3543.24 - 3546.9599999999996] finding that agreement because we've

[3545.46 - 3550.2] said that we've set up all these the the

[3546.96 - 3553.2] pillars of these problems so

[3550.2 - 3555.4199999999996] um Ohad and and Professor franconi I'd

[3553.2 - 3558.4199999999996] like to now that we've set the stage

[3555.42 - 3561.059] let's let's watch the play how do you

[3558.42 - 3562.7400000000002] take those natural language discussions

[3561.059 - 3564.96] that you you know the three of us have

[3562.74 - 3567.72] about our requirements what are the

[3564.96 - 3570.54] layers of abstraction that we that that

[3567.72 - 3572.5789999999997] need to happen that you have solved to

[3570.54 - 3574.14] then get from my my natural language

[3572.579 - 3576.119] conversation your natural language

[3574.14 - 3577.859] conversation to get to those

[3576.119 - 3579.96] requirements and specifications can you

[3577.859 - 3581.88] walk us through that I couldn't touch

[3579.96 - 3585.7200000000003] the first step which is another language

[3581.88 - 3588.78] but to logic so this is uh something

[3585.72 - 3591.359] that is well known in people studying

[3588.78 - 3594.6600000000003] languages so linguists and philosophers

[3591.359 - 3596.22] and psychologists psychologists in

[3594.66 - 3597.72] particular more formally which is the

[3596.22 - 3599.5989999999997] aspect we are interested in

[3597.72 - 3602.339] uh there are

[3599.599 - 3605.4] scientists that in the 60s and the 70s

[3602.339 - 3609.119] from montagues to Chomsky that

[3605.4 - 3612.0] completely gratified how and why natural

[3609.119 - 3615.2400000000002] language is related to a logical

[3612.0 - 3617.7] specification of it so any sentence that

[3615.24 - 3620.7599999999998] we utter in a language in English at

[3617.7 - 3622.52] this point has a very precise meaning in

[3620.76 - 3626.2200000000003] some logic

[3622.52 - 3627.78] and as we say it's even too powerful

[3626.22 - 3630.0] because we can express paradoxes

[3627.78 - 3633.059] something like this sentence is false

[3630.0 - 3635.28] right so then then I can't express this

[3633.059 - 3637.94] but I don't want to clearly transform

[3635.28 - 3640.559] this into logic because

[3637.94 - 3642.839] explained to us before that this will

[3640.559 - 3644.4] lead to an undecidable or a paradoxical

[3642.839 - 3646.98] logic which would be meaningless to

[3644.4 - 3648.299] foreign usage and indeed such a sentence

[3646.98 - 3650.52] is also meaningless for us as a

[3648.299 - 3652.74] communication mean so we want to focus

[3650.52 - 3654.78] on as I mentioned before to the fragment

[3652.74 - 3657.359] to the very large fragment of meaningful

[3654.78 - 3658.98] sentences that people sentences that we

[3657.359 - 3661.0789999999997] as a when we communicate we can

[3658.98 - 3663.54] understand each other now how to

[3661.079 - 3665.28] translate this in into logical form this

[3663.54 - 3669.7799999999997] is a well-known process

[3665.28 - 3671.6400000000003] and uh it's again it's uh again I guess

[3669.78 - 3674.1600000000003] we inspired ourselves to the Montague

[3671.64 - 3677.16] work but it's it can be done with

[3674.16 - 3680.04] current Technologies it's what in a sort

[3677.16 - 3683.64] of uh no positive way has been called

[3680.04 - 3685.98] good old uh fashion AI right the golf I

[3683.64 - 3687.54] think which people doing the neural

[3685.98 - 3689.76] networks don't lie because this is

[3687.54 - 3691.619] useless right well I don't know because

[3689.76 - 3694.5] understanding language is probably not

[3691.619 - 3697.44] useless and the way people in need an

[3694.5 - 3699.599] Echoes understand language is uh they

[3697.44 - 3701.16] don't understand language and if you

[3699.599 - 3702.839] don't if you really want to do that you

[3701.16 - 3705.299] have to go that the other way the way

[3702.839 - 3708.299] that that philosophers and linguists and

[3705.299 - 3711.599] and psychologists went through so we can

[3708.299 - 3713.7599999999998] have a logical counterpart of of natural

[3711.599 - 3715.559] language sentences it's not easy in

[3713.76 - 3718.2000000000003] terms of capturing their own General

[3715.559 - 3720.8390000000004] generality that's why that's why somehow

[3718.2 - 3725.339] in terms of real world application this

[3720.839 - 3728.16] this endeavor failed of the golf I did

[3725.339 - 3731.099] not really deliver robust natural

[3728.16 - 3734.0989999999997] language system as the Deep Learning

[3731.099 - 3735.6600000000003] Community provides because it's much

[3734.099 - 3737.52] harder because we want to understand

[3735.66 - 3741.5] what the language says as opposed to

[3737.52 - 3741.5] just statistically generate

[3742.4 - 3747.42] non-understood sentences okay so we kind

[3745.5 - 3749.52] of have this logical counterpart so in

[3747.42 - 3751.02] indeed then we by using logic for

[3749.52 - 3753.78] example we can replicate this is what

[3751.02 - 3755.7] Aristotle did in 2000 years ago he

[3753.78 - 3758.7000000000003] created the logic of syllogism

[3755.7 - 3761.46] that corresponds to the argumentation uh

[3758.7 - 3762.839] in certain particular patterns and and

[3761.46 - 3764.64] then once you have this language

[3762.839 - 3767.5789999999997] translated into logic we can employ

[3764.64 - 3772.92] logic to check whether whatever we are

[3767.579 - 3775.079] saying is is correct is whatever if you

[3772.92 - 3776.4] counter argue something against me I can

[3775.079 - 3778.38] check well your counter argument is

[3776.4 - 3780.26] false so I can easily check right so and

[3778.38 - 3781.94] that's somehow what our cognition does

[3780.26 - 3784.559] hiddenly

[3781.94 - 3786.839] and that's a really interesting uh

[3784.559 - 3789.1400000000003] cognitive psychology problem why do we

[3786.839 - 3791.5789999999997] trust

[3789.14 - 3795.48] a good argumentation

[3791.579 - 3798.0] and why logic well logic formula is just

[3795.48 - 3800.16] this is the logic is just a way to

[3798.0 - 3802.68] understand why this is true it's very

[3800.16 - 3804.7799999999997] well understood why logic is the right

[3802.68 - 3806.8799999999997] way to make a documentation which is has

[3804.78 - 3810.799] to do with the notion of

[3806.88 - 3813.059] uh entailment being ground on

[3810.799 - 3815.22] model Theory let's say something like

[3813.059 - 3819.6800000000003] this but yeah

[3815.22 - 3819.68] so now we have logic and what can go on

[3819.799 - 3824.52] pass the torch

[3823.02 - 3826.2599999999998] oh hi

[3824.52 - 3829.5] yeah so

[3826.26 - 3831.48] um from a convenience natural language

[3829.5 - 3834.42] interface

[3831.48 - 3836.579] um or control natural language it will

[3834.42 - 3838.02] it will not be full natural language you

[3836.579 - 3840.2400000000002] will not speak to the computer the way

[3838.02 - 3842.22] you speak with other people but in a

[3840.24 - 3844.8799999999997] more limited way

[3842.22 - 3847.5] from there it should be translated to

[3844.88 - 3850.38] formal logic

[3847.5 - 3853.44] which is a mathematical expression

[3850.38 - 3855.9] and from there all logical reasoning

[3853.44 - 3859.02] tasks like detecting contradictions or

[3855.9 - 3862.02] consensus and so on

[3859.02 - 3865.4] will be done automatically by the very

[3862.02 - 3865.4] algorithms that we develop

[3865.64 - 3870.7799999999997] to show that the language is decidable

[3868.44 - 3874.26] which is what we do

[3870.78 - 3876.599] we come up with algorithm that decides

[3874.26 - 3879.3590000000004] the language

[3876.599 - 3881.88] and maybe

[3879.359 - 3885.7799999999997] um it is a point to mention

[3881.88 - 3889.5] a major difficulty in this whole field

[3885.78 - 3892.8590000000004] and which is the necessity the rare

[3889.5 - 3895.619] necessity to very much combine Theory

[3892.859 - 3900.66] with engineering

[3895.619 - 3903.42] logic is a very deep Theory and it's it

[3900.66 - 3906.1189999999997] is also very computationally intensive

[3903.42 - 3907.799] naive implementation of logic is not

[3906.119 - 3910.619] going to work in real life

[3907.799 - 3912.66] you need extremely good engineering as

[3910.619 - 3915.54] well as extremely good theory and

[3912.66 - 3917.16] surprisingly or not this combination is

[3915.54 - 3919.46] very rare in the software development

[3917.16 - 3919.46] world

[3920.46 - 3925.98] and I guess this is one of our strength

[3924.78 - 3931.94] points

[3925.98 - 3931.94] and indeed we invest a lot in both forms

[3935.22 - 3940.68] so once you once you said well thank you

[3938.76 - 3942.2990000000004] both for for helping break that that

[3940.68 - 3944.64] down from

[3942.299 - 3948.54] um you know from language controlled

[3944.64 - 3950.819] language formal logic and so on

[3948.54 - 3953.819] so let's

[3950.819 - 3956.94] let's expand this or maybe look at it

[3953.819 - 3958.14] from a different angle in terms of

[3956.94 - 3959.94] um so we've you know we've talked about

[3958.14 - 3961.5589999999997] the the talmata language the Tau

[3959.94 - 3964.2000000000003] language we've talked about the problems

[3961.559 - 3966.7200000000003] of uh of distributed development of

[3964.2 - 3969.0] software and as you mentioned getting

[3966.72 - 3971.5789999999997] getting to those specifications those

[3969.0 - 3974.22] those purely logical Expressions as to

[3971.579 - 3975.7200000000003] what you know the what we want it to do

[3974.22 - 3977.7599999999998] but

[3975.72 - 3979.9199999999996] that's not where the Tau Network ends

[3977.76 - 3982.619] right that's actually just kind of step

[3979.92 - 3985.799] one and after that as you talked about

[3982.619 - 3988.28] before how do we get to the to the how

[3985.799 - 3992.16] how does it do that how does the network

[3988.28 - 3994.7400000000002] arrive at the actual new software that

[3992.16 - 3996.359] you know once once people have expressed

[3994.74 - 3997.68] their requirements

[3996.359 - 4000.14] um and then you know as you also

[3997.68 - 4001.819] mentioned uh you fight you find the

[4000.14 - 4003.6189999999997] points of agreement right where do the

[4001.819 - 4005.7799999999997] requirements overlap where do they agree

[4003.619 - 4008.299] so then what's the next step once you

[4005.78 - 4010.28] find those specifications

[4008.299 - 4012.559] how do we how do we get to the how of

[4010.28 - 4015.619] the software

[4012.559 - 4019.1600000000003] yeah so starting with the

[4015.619 - 4020.6600000000003] directions analogy

[4019.16 - 4022.3999999999996] um so

[4020.66 - 4025.2799999999997] one says

[4022.4 - 4028.579] I want to go to a supermarket and the

[4025.28 - 4030.92] other says I want to go to a restaurant

[4028.579 - 4033.619] they see this to the computer so Google

[4030.92 - 4036.26] Maps prepares a route that goes to a

[4033.619 - 4039.94] supermarket and through a restaurant

[4036.26 - 4042.8590000000004] and then the self-driving car

[4039.94 - 4044.42] execute the South

[4042.859 - 4046.2799999999997] so indeed

[4044.42 - 4048.38] after people say what they have to say

[4046.28 - 4051.44] we automatically calculate the agreement

[4048.38 - 4054.559] we get some kind of specification we

[4051.44 - 4056.42] automatically run the specification so

[4054.559 - 4059.299] that's yet another point

[4056.42 - 4062.299] the specification is executable indeed

[4059.299 - 4062.299] automatically

[4064.16 - 4070.0389999999998] so this the specification is Excel it is

[4067.64 - 4072.44] itself already executable it doesn't

[4070.039 - 4074.48] need to be translated to python or C or

[4072.44 - 4076.599] anything like that

[4074.48 - 4079.52] that's right well

[4076.599 - 4081.7000000000003] there should be some program that takes

[4079.52 - 4084.44] the specification and runs it

[4081.7 - 4089.299] so you can look at it implicitly as

[4084.44 - 4091.64] translating it to machine code okay but

[4089.299 - 4093.14] just like you know Java python that you

[4091.64 - 4095.0589999999997] mentioned

[4093.14 - 4098.3589999999995] they're also not compiled languages

[4095.059 - 4100.64] there's some interpreter the constant

[4098.359 - 4103.46] same here we will be interpreter that

[4100.64 - 4106.6990000000005] runs the Tau language

[4103.46 - 4108.7390000000005] excellent I guess excellent by pushing

[4106.699 - 4110.599999999999] the Google Maps metaphor right this is

[4108.739 - 4113.299] exactly what the AI does

[4110.6 - 4116.0] so you really say I want to go from A to

[4113.299 - 4117.92] B or even take a robot or Google Maps

[4116.0 - 4120.58] whatever and that's all you have to say

[4117.92 - 4124.16] then the system

[4120.58 - 4125.48] finds the execution path so this is the

[4124.16 - 4127.4] path and this path there are many

[4125.48 - 4129.678999999999] possibly infinite paths different

[4127.4 - 4131.9] different programs that execute

[4129.679 - 4133.279] your desires right your desirada your

[4131.9 - 4136.58] specification

[4133.279 - 4138.7390000000005] so you may give preferences you can say

[4136.58 - 4141.3189999999995] well I want to have the shortest one or

[4138.739 - 4143.7789999999995] the fastest one or the cheaper one in

[4141.319 - 4146.660000000001] terms of fuel they need to to use

[4143.779 - 4148.1] whatever so you have a sort of among all

[4146.66 - 4149.3589999999995] the possible realization of this

[4148.1 - 4151.1] specification because of course there

[4149.359 - 4153.5] are many there'll be there will be

[4151.1 - 4156.319] reason to prefer some over others

[4153.5 - 4159.319] and and so this is a typical AI problem

[4156.319 - 4162.5] which in the naive way is implemented as

[4159.319 - 4165.38] a search problem so you have you want to

[4162.5 - 4166.819] do things in terms of a robot I start a

[4165.38 - 4168.4400000000005] certain position I know I have to go

[4166.819 - 4170.779] there first of all I can have some

[4168.44 - 4173.239] heuristics I can have some some way to

[4170.779 - 4175.339000000001] to try first so I know if I have to go

[4173.239 - 4176.9] to to the city center or to the

[4175.339 - 4179.7789999999995] supermarket and know that it's in that

[4176.9 - 4182.0] direction because you see the tower

[4179.779 - 4184.160000000001] and that however well I go in that

[4182.0 - 4186.14] direction but then maybe I hit against

[4184.16 - 4189.5599999999995] the wall okay maybe this is not really

[4186.14 - 4191.359] smart so well I backtrack and I try to

[4189.56 - 4192.679] go slightly on the left and then it I

[4191.359 - 4195.26] keep going trying to go in that

[4192.679 - 4198.86] direction so I have some driving force

[4195.26 - 4200.84] which is the heuristics I search for for

[4198.86 - 4203.36] diff for the solution my party

[4200.84 - 4204.8] potentially failing and backtracking and

[4203.36 - 4207.199] then eventually I find the goal that's

[4204.8 - 4210.320000000001] how Google Maps find the the the the the

[4207.199 - 4212.419999999999] the your paths the best one the cheaper

[4210.32 - 4215.0599999999995] one Whatever using these kind of

[4212.42 - 4218.2390000000005] principles now what is also quite

[4215.06 - 4222.320000000001] special in in the technology employed by

[4218.239 - 4224.659] Tau which is fully an idea of rad is

[4222.32 - 4226.099999999999] that we don't rely these arguments on

[4224.659 - 4228.379999999999] third we don't base these algorithms on

[4226.1 - 4229.52] search but we use them based on a

[4228.38 - 4232.34] different kind of technology which is

[4229.52 - 4237.14] Boolean algebras and automata so in this

[4232.34 - 4239.719] sense we avoid also hopefully somehow uh

[4237.14 - 4241.76] in in most of the cases the hopefully

[4239.719 - 4243.679] means that is you cannot guarantee that

[4241.76 - 4245.3] the solution will be fined always found

[4243.679 - 4248.14] in always in the fastest possible way

[4245.3 - 4251.3] but you can approximate the optimality

[4248.14 - 4253.52] by by minimizing the time that you waste

[4251.3 - 4255.4400000000005] by doing wrong choices somehow right and

[4253.52 - 4257.780000000001] then you try to find the best program

[4255.44 - 4261.259999999999] the best implementation of your

[4257.78 - 4263.92] specification uh in in a reasonable

[4261.26 - 4263.92] amount of time

[4264.739 - 4271.659] yes excellent

[4267.5 - 4274.28] um okay so we have

[4271.659 - 4276.5599999999995] uh well I guess before I declare this

[4274.28 - 4278.54] are there any other

[4276.56 - 4281.2390000000005] um components or topics before we break

[4278.54 - 4283.94] into the the result what is the final

[4281.239 - 4285.98] result of Tau and how are people going

[4283.94 - 4287.96] to interact with it and you know okay we

[4285.98 - 4289.639999999999] have a way you have you have described a

[4287.96 - 4292.28] way to

[4289.64 - 4293.84] um to develop software in a

[4292.28 - 4295.759999999999] decentralized manner with this

[4293.84 - 4297.5] interpreted language

[4295.76 - 4299.56] um but kind of the question then is like

[4297.5 - 4301.58] okay so what what can we do with

[4299.56 - 4303.620000000001] decentralized development of software

[4301.58 - 4305.96] what is the what is the long-term

[4303.62 - 4308.42] outcome of this and how is it going to

[4305.96 - 4310.219] change my life your life how is it going

[4308.42 - 4312.52] to change the world

[4310.219 - 4312.52] foreign

[4313.9 - 4321.44] aspect one thing that happens at the

[4318.62 - 4322.94] beginning is everyone just saying what

[4321.44 - 4325.219] they have to say

[4322.94 - 4327.139999999999] everyone Express their opinion that

[4325.219 - 4330.04] Mario may not reflect on how the

[4327.14 - 4330.04] software should be like

[4330.86 - 4336.32] and as a byproduct

[4334.4 - 4339.86] you are going to have

[4336.32 - 4341.719] the most powerful AI in the world

[4339.86 - 4344.42] controlled by the people

[4341.719 - 4346.46] that belongs to the people

[4344.42 - 4349.219] not belong to one entity that who knows

[4346.46 - 4351.86] what their intentions are and it will be

[4349.219 - 4355.28] the most powerful because

[4351.86 - 4359.179] so many people train this AI they just

[4355.28 - 4362.3] speak like they speak in social networks

[4359.179 - 4365.0] I will say that we already uploaded our

[4362.3 - 4367.04] mind to the cyber

[4365.0 - 4369.02] we just didn't do it in machine

[4367.04 - 4371.6] comprehensible languages

[4369.02 - 4373.400000000001] now that you will re-uploid your mind to

[4371.6 - 4376.06] the Cyber in a way that machine can

[4373.4 - 4376.0599999999995] understand you

[4377.3 - 4382.6] the consequences of this are bigger than

[4380.0 - 4382.6] imagination

[4384.739 - 4390.04] so that's one big deal that is going to

[4386.84 - 4390.04] happen from this technology

[4390.32 - 4393.86] and then

[4392.48 - 4396.5] um

[4393.86 - 4399.86] suppose after you expressed a lot of

[4396.5 - 4402.28] opinions now your Tau client knows what

[4399.86 - 4402.28] you want

[4402.5 - 4410.54] and knows ways to achieve what you want

[4406.4 - 4414.339999999999] can automatically organize stuff as long

[4410.54 - 4414.34] as the staff live in the computer world

[4414.86 - 4421.58] to give you what you want

[4417.8 - 4422.78] whether it is Taylor for me a good deal

[4421.58 - 4426.62] that

[4422.78 - 4429.44] takes into account my abilities my

[4426.62 - 4431.0599999999995] skills my assets and other people bids

[4429.44 - 4433.4] and so on

[4431.06 - 4437.14] or how the

[4433.4 - 4437.139999999999] how Society should be like

[4439.76 - 4443.659000000001] and so long well you cannot just go to

[4441.98 - 4444.62] Google and tell Google give me what I

[4443.659 - 4447.08] want

[4444.62 - 4450.28] but you will be able to go to Tao and

[4447.08 - 4450.28] tell it give me what I want

[4451.219 - 4455.96] so this this is why when I when I got

[4455.0 - 4458.54] this

[4455.96 - 4459.86] in our earlier conversations it it

[4458.54 - 4462.98] completely

[4459.86 - 4465.0199999999995] blew my mind because for me the

[4462.98 - 4467.839999999999] difficulty was connecting okay formal

[4465.02 - 4470.84] logic software specifications natural

[4467.84 - 4472.46] language but what you're saying is once

[4470.84 - 4474.92] you have that full stack all those

[4472.46 - 4476.42] layers of abstraction and and then

[4474.92 - 4478.1] because it's not just it's not just an

[4476.42 - 4480.7390000000005] individual it's not just me talking to

[4478.1 - 4483.5] Tao and it and it deriving

[4480.739 - 4485.0599999999995] um specifications from my words but it's

[4483.5 - 4487.58] also doing the same thing for everyone

[4485.06 - 4490.52] who's participating in Tau and finding

[4487.58 - 4493.219] those points of agreement and then it's

[4490.52 - 4494.26] allowing the Tau Network to update

[4493.219 - 4497.0] itself

[4494.26 - 4498.92] automatically and so everyone who

[4497.0 - 4500.3] participates in a tel Network and we'll

[4498.92 - 4502.34] talk a little bit about how that's going

[4500.3 - 4504.56] to be implemented and deployed in just a

[4502.34 - 4507.4400000000005] moment but I just want to reiterate for

[4504.56 - 4508.52] our audience this is this is this is the

[4507.44 - 4511.4] key

[4508.52 - 4513.9800000000005] um Innovation here where by interacting

[4511.4 - 4515.12] with with your Tau client and as I

[4513.98 - 4516.5] mentioned we'll get into the

[4515.12 - 4518.599999999999] implementation and deployment in a

[4516.5 - 4522.32] moment but by interacting with the Tau

[4518.6 - 4524.42] client over time time it will learn what

[4522.32 - 4526.82] you want what you need and it's all

[4524.42 - 4529.34] recorded based on those expressions of

[4526.82 - 4531.44] opinions and needs through from our

[4529.34 - 4534.08] natural language correct

[4531.44 - 4535.82] um so it will take that and then for uh

[4534.08 - 4537.86] translate it into the controlled

[4535.82 - 4539.9] language and then further and further

[4537.86 - 4542.179] abstract it down into formal logic and

[4539.9 - 4544.099999999999] specifications but then everyone who's

[4542.179 - 4546.26] participating in Tau

[4544.1 - 4549.4400000000005] will do the same thing and as you

[4546.26 - 4552.1990000000005] mentioned everyone's ideas and needs and

[4549.44 - 4554.599999999999] requirements and and knowledge will

[4552.199 - 4556.639999999999] become embedded in the whole Tau Network

[4554.6 - 4559.64] and that means that the town network

[4556.64 - 4562.280000000001] will be as intelligent as everyone

[4559.64 - 4565.400000000001] participating in it but not just as as

[4562.28 - 4568.34] as individuals it will record those

[4565.4 - 4570.799999999999] ideas abilities in any new capabilities

[4568.34 - 4573.26] of the network over time and it will

[4570.8 - 4575.719] continue to get smarter is that a good

[4573.26 - 4579.679] summary of kind of how the Tau network

[4575.719 - 4583.04] is alive in in some respects yes just

[4579.679 - 4585.26] with one kevia I don't want the audience

[4583.04 - 4587.84] to think that you're going to give a

[4585.26 - 4589.88] natural language sentence and it will

[4587.84 - 4592.9400000000005] understand you and that's it for natural

[4589.88 - 4595.34] language to formal language it will be

[4592.94 - 4597.259999999999] an interactive process but the user will

[4595.34 - 4599.0] have to eventually approve the formal

[4597.26 - 4602.2390000000005] statement

[4599.0 - 4603.739] but other than that yes that's where the

[4602.239 - 4605.718999999999] system is heading to in the long term

[4603.739 - 4610.0] yes excellent

[4605.719 - 4610.0] and so how does this

[4610.42 - 4616.159] help me help me explain to our our

[4613.699 - 4617.96] audience because I have I have an idea

[4616.159 - 4620.0599999999995] in my head of what this Collective

[4617.96 - 4623.4800000000005] Network intelligence has because it's

[4620.06 - 4625.219] it's it forms a layer not just for

[4623.48 - 4627.44] machines to communicate like you know

[4625.219 - 4630.7390000000005] with with a blockchain right blockchain

[4627.44 - 4633.678999999999] is is is how machines can can work

[4630.739 - 4636.259999999999] together uh maintain consensus but this

[4633.679 - 4638.36] also allows for humans to communicate

[4636.26 - 4641.3] uh seamlessly not just with each other

[4638.36 - 4643.4] but also with the machine layer

[4641.3 - 4645.8] and then ultimately what are the kinds

[4643.4 - 4648.32] of things that the Tau Network can be

[4645.8 - 4650.78] endowed with what are the abilities or

[4648.32 - 4654.08] capabilities or the extensibility of the

[4650.78 - 4655.46] Tau Network like you know okay like we

[4654.08 - 4656.48] talked about like Google Maps and stuff

[4655.46 - 4659.06] but that's

[4656.48 - 4661.759999999999] that's not even the beginning of what we

[4659.06 - 4663.4400000000005] what what you could do with Tau so what

[4661.76 - 4665.12] are what is the high end what is the

[4663.44 - 4666.86] long-term

[4665.12 - 4668.239] um set of capabilities that you can

[4666.86 - 4670.159] imagine and like you said some of it is

[4668.239 - 4672.739] beyond imagination but how do we get

[4670.159 - 4674.96] from where we are today to the limits of

[4672.739 - 4676.58] our imagination of the Tau Network walk

[4674.96 - 4678.44] us through that

[4676.58 - 4680.42] thank you

[4678.44 - 4682.46] so indeed the main thing is beyond the

[4680.42 - 4684.56] imagination but the few things we can

[4682.46 - 4685.88] imagine

[4684.56 - 4688.04] and

[4685.88 - 4690.7390000000005] one thing is

[4688.04 - 4692.6] combining brain power

[4690.739 - 4693.86] so I will say that I can give you a

[4692.6 - 4694.58] solution to all probabilities in the

[4693.86 - 4696.92] world

[4694.58 - 4698.48] we have a problem you take the one

[4696.92 - 4700.58] million smartest people in the world you

[4698.48 - 4701.419999999999] put them in one room until they show the

[4700.58 - 4703.64] problem

[4701.42 - 4705.32] well but it doesn't work because how can

[4703.64 - 4709.46] one million people combine the brain

[4705.32 - 4711.0199999999995] power it's just impossible as for now

[4709.46 - 4712.82] but

[4711.02 - 4713.900000000001] if the computer understands them what

[4712.82 - 4718.0] they say

[4713.9 - 4718.0] it can help in combining the brain power

[4718.04 - 4725.92] so that's one thing combining brain

[4722.179 - 4725.92] power large scale for the first time

[4726.92 - 4732.8] another thing which is something that we

[4730.1 - 4735.860000000001] also work on actually implementing but

[4732.8 - 4738.8] this is going to be a part of Tau and

[4735.86 - 4739.94] a big part of what our course token is

[4738.8 - 4741.8] about

[4739.94 - 4744.62] is

[4741.8 - 4746.900000000001] um creating an economy of knowledge

[4744.62 - 4749.78] you can trade

[4746.9 - 4752.0] single pieces of knowledge directly

[4749.78 - 4755.54] and indeed we spoke about training the

[4752.0 - 4758.3] machine formalizing knowledge and so on

[4755.54 - 4759.739] if there is also a financial incentive

[4758.3 - 4761.6] to do so

[4759.739 - 4764.44] you can expect other such magnitude

[4761.6 - 4764.4400000000005] small activity

[4766.94 - 4772.5199999999995] and that is the the Agra token that

[4769.76 - 4776.2390000000005] you're referring to yeah

[4772.52 - 4778.34] so well another thing

[4776.239 - 4782.36] is as soon as people are very worried

[4778.34 - 4784.400000000001] about AI doing the bad stuff

[4782.36 - 4786.94] and as we said before about the laws of

[4784.4 - 4786.94] robotics

[4787.46 - 4791.78] the existing field of mathematical logic

[4790.4 - 4793.759999999999] does not know

[4791.78 - 4796.28] how to make sure that the next software

[4793.76 - 4797.900000000001] update will maintain a lot of robotics

[4796.28 - 4800.599999999999] and that's a very serious problem

[4797.9 - 4803.12] concerning AI safety

[4800.6 - 4805.84] but how far of this problem

[4803.12 - 4809.679] and how you will be able to reject

[4805.84 - 4809.679] undesired future Behavior

[4811.88 - 4818.78] and so the the the to get to that point

[4815.36 - 4821.42] all the users of Tau will at some point

[4818.78 - 4823.4] Express that opinion through controlled

[4821.42 - 4825.02] language through through that process

[4823.4 - 4826.879999999999] that you mentioned of

[4825.02 - 4829.0] you know working with the machine to

[4826.88 - 4831.7390000000005] express your desire but say for instance

[4829.0 - 4834.08] we we collectively

[4831.739 - 4837.44] uh put in a requirement into the town

[4834.08 - 4838.64] Network like don't ever launch nuclear

[4837.44 - 4840.919999999999] missiles right that's the Skynet

[4838.64 - 4844.1] solution that everyone is afraid of so

[4840.92 - 4845.84] is is that some is can we literally work

[4844.1 - 4847.52] on that with Tau like don't ever launch

[4845.84 - 4849.14] nuclear weapons or or something along

[4847.52 - 4851.2390000000005] those lines like you said the

[4849.14 - 4854.179] contradictions or the restraints the

[4851.239 - 4856.94] rejecting of instructions or coding or

[4854.179 - 4858.14] other things how is is is that how that

[4856.94 - 4860.96] works

[4858.14 - 4863.54] yes whatever you are able to say in the

[4860.96 - 4866.3] language will happen for sure

[4863.54 - 4868.4] but the difficulty is to say what you

[4866.3 - 4870.8] want to say in the language indeed right

[4868.4 - 4874.04] and to write

[4870.8 - 4876.1990000000005] a whole design a whole book in natural

[4874.04 - 4877.82] language is also how

[4876.199 - 4880.099999999999] it's not because it's logic then it

[4877.82 - 4882.86] becomes hard itself also the natural

[4880.1 - 4884.179] language this difficulty is not going to

[4882.86 - 4886.82] disappear

[4884.179 - 4889.9400000000005] maybe it cannot be spread among many

[4886.82 - 4893.659] people because of the combining brain

[4889.94 - 4896.54] power aspect we spoke about but

[4893.659 - 4899.799999999999] it's not going to be fully automatic

[4896.54 - 4899.8] fully easy no

[4905.3 - 4910.34] so

[4907.04 - 4912.26] let's take that example of creating a

[4910.34 - 4913.82] constraint a limitation on the Tau

[4912.26 - 4916.400000000001] Network something that it must not do

[4913.82 - 4921.32] right you know expressed in formal logic

[4916.4 - 4923.9] but let's look more uh more beneficial

[4921.32 - 4926.44] more utopian what if we were to say

[4923.9 - 4928.639999999999] something like

[4926.44 - 4929.9] how would it go about implementing

[4928.64 - 4933.02] something like let's say everyone on the

[4929.9 - 4935.54] town networks had uh defined the hat or

[4933.02 - 4937.52] the what right the specification of make

[4935.54 - 4939.679] sure everyone is fed make sure that

[4937.52 - 4941.3] there's no hunger on the planet is that

[4939.679 - 4943.82] something that could be expressed in the

[4941.3 - 4945.9800000000005] towel language Town meta language and

[4943.82 - 4947.239] then implement it and how would that

[4945.98 - 4948.5] work or how would that look and

[4947.239 - 4950.718999999999] obviously it'll take a little while to

[4948.5 - 4952.58] get to something like that but is that

[4950.719 - 4954.7390000000005] the kind of thing you know because

[4952.58 - 4956.12] that's something I can imagine is that

[4954.739 - 4958.459999999999] the is that the kind of thing that is

[4956.12 - 4962.0199999999995] possible or feasible

[4958.46 - 4962.02] you know in the next five to ten years

[4962.36 - 4967.179] well to just Express that of course you

[4965.06 - 4970.34] can express but you will need to express

[4967.179 - 4974.62] so much more to reach a level that the

[4970.34 - 4974.62] system knows how to achieve it okay

[4975.98 - 4981.139999999999] so there's there's implicit

[4978.5 - 4983.3] uh prerequisites in order to achieve

[4981.14 - 4985.6990000000005] that outcome but that outcome could be

[4983.3 - 4989.900000000001] expressed in the Tau Network and then

[4985.699 - 4992.96] through the process of uh conversation

[4989.9 - 4995.239] um or negotiation or or exploring those

[4992.96 - 4997.82] other requirements to work up to

[4995.239 - 5000.4] something along those lines

[4997.82 - 5001.179] um or or all the prerequisite steps

[5000.4 - 5005.259999999999] rather

[5001.179 - 5009.34] yes that will take what you tell it as

[5005.26 - 5012.6990000000005] is with no modification and no guessing

[5009.34 - 5015.52] and automatically draw the conclusions

[5012.699 - 5017.919999999999] so as long as you gave it the means

[5015.52 - 5019.84] whether explicitly or implicitly to

[5017.92 - 5022.0] achieve what you want it will achieve it

[5019.84 - 5025.0] well with the small caveat of the time

[5022.0 - 5025.96] it takes the computer to compute such

[5025.0 - 5029.98] stuff

[5025.96 - 5033.76] but ignoring this caveat it will achieve

[5029.98 - 5036.28] okay so the go ahead yeah yeah so just

[5033.76 - 5038.62] to compliment then I guess similarly to

[5036.28 - 5041.38] what to the success of current deep

[5038.62 - 5044.44] neural networks that basically they do

[5041.38 - 5047.5] this analysis statistical analysis of so

[5044.44 - 5049.9] many things that were said in the past

[5047.5 - 5052.179] so that they can have an idea what could

[5049.9 - 5055.299999999999] be meaningful or what is not having a

[5052.179 - 5056.62] look what is this similarly here but in

[5055.3 - 5059.5] a completely different levels because

[5056.62 - 5062.44] again with the notion of trust added

[5059.5 - 5064.12] is that in order to achieve interesting

[5062.44 - 5065.08] conclusion the system has to have

[5064.12 - 5067.239] knowledge

[5065.08 - 5071.0199999999995] so I can imagine that the beginning Tau

[5067.239 - 5072.879999999999] will be quite stupid in the sense that

[5071.02 - 5075.1] it does not have a lot of common sense

[5072.88 - 5077.56] knowledge to to reach interesting

[5075.1 - 5079.179] conclusion for us humans in certain

[5077.56 - 5081.219] fields for example if we focus on

[5079.179 - 5083.4400000000005] software engineering well yes because

[5081.219 - 5085.84] they don't really need Common Sense

[5083.44 - 5087.699] there but if you make these examples of

[5085.84 - 5089.7390000000005] nuclear weapons or whatever then that's

[5087.699 - 5092.86] another level of thing however what is

[5089.739 - 5097.678999999999] interesting is that people by talking by

[5092.86 - 5100.42] using Tau will uh will add knowledge

[5097.679 - 5102.04] that since the common sense knowledge is

[5100.42 - 5103.84] the knowledge that we all of us have

[5102.04 - 5106.12] even that even though we don't know that

[5103.84 - 5107.5] we have but it's this all of us it's

[5106.12 - 5108.699] interesting because somehow it's all

[5107.5 - 5110.26] this knowledge that we already have an

[5108.699 - 5112.419999999999] agreement about

[5110.26 - 5115.54] we all know that elephants don't fly

[5112.42 - 5118.96] right and at some point possibly I guess

[5115.54 - 5121.12] because of this consensus mechanism this

[5118.96 - 5122.86] will be just a fact for Tau right and so

[5121.12 - 5124.659] it will build slowly all these Common

[5122.86 - 5126.339999999999] Sense knowledge because everybody agrees

[5124.659 - 5128.44] on this implicitly

[5126.34 - 5130.54] and against this because since we are

[5128.44 - 5132.28] using logic then all this implicit facts

[5130.54 - 5133.6] are also important so whatever whenever

[5132.28 - 5136.179] you make a statement that does something

[5133.6 - 5137.679] implicit well this is it's not

[5136.179 - 5140.52] exclusively said but it's true anyway

[5137.679 - 5144.46] because it's implicit

[5140.52 - 5146.1990000000005] uh and so you will that will grow up and

[5144.46 - 5147.46] and and acquire all this Common Sense

[5146.199 - 5150.04] knowledge the other thing I wanted to

[5147.46 - 5152.62] mention is is the idea of the law of

[5150.04 - 5154.54] Robotics because Tau can also take a

[5152.62 - 5157.9] very nasty direction if if people want

[5154.54 - 5159.699] so maybe the majority wants to vote

[5157.9 - 5161.62] for having a dictator

[5159.699 - 5163.178999999999] so since they can change the rules they

[5161.62 - 5164.679] can change the agreement rules they can

[5163.179 - 5167.56] change how the system evolves they can

[5164.679 - 5170.62] say Well only if we get the approval by

[5167.56 - 5173.080000000001] or your preferred dictator so you have

[5170.62 - 5175.719] this person that because everybody

[5173.08 - 5177.58] agrees that they want to pass all the

[5175.719 - 5179.76] agreements through this person or to

[5177.58 - 5182.92] this agent whatever just mention example

[5179.76 - 5184.719] now this means that from now since now

[5182.92 - 5186.46] this is the new mechanism of agreement

[5184.719 - 5189.46] you cannot change this right because

[5186.46 - 5191.56] it's a it's a law for this sort of it's

[5189.46 - 5194.32] a constitution and to change this

[5191.56 - 5196.42] uh you have to apply this rule itself so

[5194.32 - 5198.28] only with the approval of the dictator

[5196.42 - 5200.02] you can change the rule that he is the

[5198.28 - 5202.12] dictator

[5200.02 - 5204.46] that's if that gets approved in the

[5202.12 - 5206.0199999999995] first place yes yes indeed but it might

[5204.46 - 5208.36] not ever get approved so that's why I

[5206.02 - 5211.6] also conceive that there may be branches

[5208.36 - 5213.099999999999] different realities of Tau that the one

[5211.6 - 5214.659000000001] which has a dictatorship or some

[5213.1 - 5216.88] something like countries right people

[5214.659 - 5218.739] that create their own majority religious

[5216.88 - 5221.02] subgroups that create a religious

[5218.739 - 5223.718999999999] reality or whatever right so that's also

[5221.02 - 5225.88] interesting I guess

[5223.719 - 5228.52] um so you what you're saying is that

[5225.88 - 5231.28] that could be a a smaller implementation

[5228.52 - 5233.7390000000005] or an isolated Tau Network might end up

[5231.28 - 5234.82] with that set of rules

[5233.739 - 5237.699] okay

[5234.82 - 5239.62] now but what if so here's here's where I

[5237.699 - 5241.839999999999] after learning about this and I was just

[5239.62 - 5243.219] thinking about it

[5241.84 - 5245.02] um

[5243.219 - 5248.62] what if

[5245.02 - 5251.320000000001] what if Tau ends up much broader

[5248.62 - 5253.96] like across entire nations or continents

[5251.32 - 5255.639] or or Global is that is that part of the

[5253.96 - 5257.8] vision is that part of the dream where

[5255.639 - 5259.84] everyone is interacting with the same

[5257.8 - 5263.4400000000005] town Network and it becomes collectively

[5259.84 - 5265.2390000000005] more intelligent and and and has the

[5263.44 - 5267.879999999999] knowledge and capabilities of all humans

[5265.239 - 5269.259999999999] across the whole planet is that is that

[5267.88 - 5270.9400000000005] part of the dream because that's that's

[5269.26 - 5273.34] to me that's that's where my imagination

[5270.94 - 5276.0] goes with the technology that you guys

[5273.34 - 5276.0] have outlined

[5278.58 - 5285.28] well I believe that anyone should have a

[5282.76 - 5288.6990000000005] significant voice

[5285.28 - 5290.739] and in Tao is indeed a voice amplifier

[5288.699 - 5292.719] and you may ask well if you amplify

[5290.739 - 5295.239] everyone's voice then what's the point

[5292.719 - 5297.219] then you remain with the noise but when

[5295.239 - 5302.099999999999] it does the magic of amplifying all

[5297.219 - 5302.1] voices without having the noise

[5302.32 - 5306.46] and I personally yes I want to see

[5305.38 - 5309.28] everyone

[5306.46 - 5311.62] saying their opinion in society takes

[5309.28 - 5314.28] everyone into account

[5311.62 - 5316.96] whether

[5314.28 - 5320.32] governments want that or will go this

[5316.96 - 5322.4800000000005] direction I don't know

[5320.32 - 5324.46] right it wouldn't even have to be like I

[5322.48 - 5326.739] guess a government could adopt it right

[5324.46 - 5328.9] like one one early step and I've

[5326.739 - 5331.36] discussed this concept with other folks

[5328.9 - 5333.28] is using using Dao's distributed

[5331.36 - 5335.199] autonomous organizations or like

[5333.28 - 5337.42] townships or homeowners associations

[5335.199 - 5339.159] that could be a first step

[5337.42 - 5341.5] um but yeah it wouldn't necessarily need

[5339.159 - 5343.599999999999] to be adopted by governments but if it's

[5341.5 - 5345.94] if it's if it's by voluntary

[5343.6 - 5349.120000000001] participation

[5345.94 - 5351.219] right if if I can decide to set up a

[5349.12 - 5353.44] town node on my phone and then I'm

[5351.219 - 5355.12] participating in the town Network it's

[5353.44 - 5357.94] almost like nobody could stop it either

[5355.12 - 5359.8] is that is that a possible possible

[5357.94 - 5361.599999999999] future is is that's one of the the

[5359.8 - 5365.04] natures the robust Natures of blockchain

[5361.6 - 5365.04] is that it's difficult to turn off

[5365.62 - 5370.12] yes just like

[5368.46 - 5372.46] the the

[5370.12 - 5375.239] most evolutionary thing ever happened in

[5372.46 - 5375.2390000000005] history is the internet

[5375.82 - 5380.32] and indeed people say what they say in

[5378.34 - 5382.4800000000005] the internet they try to stop it yes we

[5380.32 - 5383.739] now we have a lot of censorship

[5382.48 - 5386.138999999999] but

[5383.739 - 5388.36] people still to a large extent able to

[5386.139 - 5390.219] say what they have to say

[5388.36 - 5392.62] although it is propagated only for

[5390.219 - 5395.7390000000005] people who read them there is a limit to

[5392.62 - 5397.8] how many people you can read every day

[5395.739 - 5397.799999999999] um

[5398.1 - 5405.120000000001] you are going to see a summarized map of

[5402.04 - 5405.12] what everyone says

[5405.52 - 5408.9400000000005] because it can be that two people have

[5407.44 - 5411.46] three opinions

[5408.94 - 5413.138999999999] but in a million people they will not be

[5411.46 - 5415.12] a million opinions there will be a lot

[5413.139 - 5417.12] of overlap

[5415.12 - 5417.12] um

[5417.4 - 5422.739] so you can you can Aggregate and

[5419.92 - 5424.9] summarize and cluster not just people as

[5422.739 - 5426.759999999999] a whole but but their opinions and so it

[5424.9 - 5429.159] says you overlap with this group over

[5426.76 - 5432.42] here and and that's part of that finding

[5429.159 - 5435.239] consensus or finding agreement in

[5432.42 - 5438.58] arbitrarily large populations

[5435.239 - 5441.58] this is what we call the opinion map

[5438.58 - 5441.58] shows

[5443.739 - 5448.839999999999] so you can think about the Twitter feed

[5445.96 - 5452.02] or Facebook feed they look like this

[5448.84 - 5455.4400000000005] user said that this user said that

[5452.02 - 5458.860000000001] imagine you could say it this opinion

[5455.44 - 5461.94] is held by those Industries

[5458.86 - 5461.94] the other way up

[5463.179 - 5469.659] so let me throw a hypothetical into the

[5466.06 - 5472.780000000001] into this is let's imagine a future

[5469.659 - 5475.0599999999995] where there's millions of Tau users and

[5472.78 - 5477.04] there are opinions that are

[5475.06 - 5478.6] diametrically opposed that are mutually

[5477.04 - 5481.239] exclusive

[5478.6 - 5482.8] does the Tau Network try to reconcile

[5481.239 - 5485.08] that or is the answer it just doesn't

[5482.8 - 5487.3] address that issue if there's if there's

[5485.08 - 5489.219] that level of antagonism how does that

[5487.3 - 5492.159000000001] work in the network

[5489.219 - 5494.62] Tau will never guess and will never put

[5492.159 - 5497.739] words in your mouth it will always be

[5494.62 - 5501.659] exactly what you told it that's the

[5497.739 - 5504.339999999999] whole point of using logic okay

[5501.659 - 5507.5199999999995] but I guess maybe not how but let's say

[5504.34 - 5509.5] let's say if my opinion is is we should

[5507.52 - 5511.719] feed everyone and that you know I

[5509.5 - 5513.58] express that opinion and you're in your

[5511.719 - 5515.62] opinion is we shouldn't feed anyone

[5513.58 - 5518.0199999999995] people should feed themselves and so

[5515.62 - 5520.719] from if those two opinions are expressed

[5518.02 - 5522.639] in formal logic at least to my you know

[5520.719 - 5526.179] amateur brain they seem like they're

[5522.639 - 5527.92] mutually exclusive right is that right

[5526.179 - 5529.54] and so what how would how would that be

[5527.92 - 5531.88] reconciled in the town Network or would

[5529.54 - 5533.739] it not be reconciled it will not be it

[5531.88 - 5537.04] is a contradiction there is a

[5533.739 - 5539.98] disagreement okay to do so there are

[5537.04 - 5542.739] ways to mitigate it you can if you think

[5539.98 - 5545.199] about creating a mechanism of debate

[5542.739 - 5548.199] which is kind of again debate is kind of

[5545.199 - 5549.5199999999995] a game another thing is

[5548.199 - 5554.46] um

[5549.52 - 5554.46] who how what consensus means

[5554.56 - 5558.580000000001] so we can say this thing that everyone

[5556.42 - 5562.32] agrees on or the majority algorithm and

[5558.58 - 5562.32] so on and this can also change with time

[5563.02 - 5568.0] bottom line the users will have to

[5565.9 - 5571.78] Define how to address these situations

[5568.0 - 5575.38] there is no out-of-the-box solution

[5571.78 - 5577.179] I see so to to to walk through a

[5575.38 - 5579.52] hypothetical where there's any any any

[5577.179 - 5582.219] point of contention

[5579.52 - 5584.139] um whatever the topic is if if there can

[5582.219 - 5587.44] be no agreement on any particular

[5584.139 - 5589.54] solution part of part of what happens

[5587.44 - 5591.46] moving forward is there might be a

[5589.54 - 5594.04] discussion about even how to make the

[5591.46 - 5596.08] decision what are the decision criteria

[5594.04 - 5597.4] or what are the other

[5596.08 - 5599.98] um like there might be a debate

[5597.4 - 5601.42] mechanism as you said or there could be

[5599.98 - 5604.599999999999] um maybe the rule is set that you only

[5601.42 - 5607.06] need 98 majority vote and if two percent

[5604.6 - 5611.02] disagree they get ignored or you know

[5607.06 - 5613.4800000000005] but anything any rules can be uh

[5611.02 - 5614.92] conjured up and eventually applied

[5613.48 - 5617.08] um through the Tau Network

[5614.92 - 5619.84] that's why you need to change the laws

[5617.08 - 5622.0599999999995] of changing the laws that's why exactly

[5619.84 - 5625.84] exactly

[5622.06 - 5628.3] um that's it this is phenomenal I

[5625.84 - 5630.34] it's still it still blows my mind when I

[5628.3 - 5635.1990000000005] when I sit and think about the potential

[5630.34 - 5638.32] power of this network because it is a

[5635.199 - 5640.299999999999] Learning Network it is a new kind of

[5638.32 - 5642.34] kind of collective intelligence or or

[5640.3 - 5645.58] hive mind almost

[5642.34 - 5647.8] um between humans and machines so just I

[5645.58 - 5649.719] want to then of course I'm excited about

[5647.8 - 5652.179] this and I'll continue rambling about it

[5649.719 - 5654.58] forever but I want to hear

[5652.179 - 5656.7390000000005] um uh Professor franconi um you haven't

[5654.58 - 5660.28] said much in the last uh 10 minutes or

[5656.739 - 5661.599999999999] so where do you see Tau going like you

[5660.28 - 5663.94] know obviously you're committed to this

[5661.6 - 5666.54] project what is your personal dream what

[5663.94 - 5671.138999999999] do you want to see happen

[5666.54 - 5674.38] uh well I tend to be more pragmatic and

[5671.139 - 5676.2390000000005] less of a dreamer in the sense of uh

[5674.38 - 5679.32] well dreaming does not mean it does not

[5676.239 - 5683.739] mean unachievable means longer term ring

[5679.32 - 5686.62] I have a shorter time dream uh and I

[5683.739 - 5689.199] really see this already applicable as it

[5686.62 - 5691.78] was mentioned before in these small

[5689.199 - 5693.699] communities I mean like that we have

[5691.78 - 5695.44] several blockchain systems maybe each

[5693.699 - 5697.599999999999] one working with different kind of rules

[5695.44 - 5699.28] smart counters for example the area of

[5697.6 - 5701.1] smart contracts I think is as a natural

[5699.28 - 5703.12] application here

[5701.1 - 5705.1] is a piece of code that nobody

[5703.12 - 5706.96] understands and you can be fooled by

[5705.1 - 5708.400000000001] anybody because you give a directive to

[5706.96 - 5710.52] do something and then the weight is

[5708.4 - 5713.0199999999995] actually implemented is completely

[5710.52 - 5714.76] disconnected from from what was my

[5713.02 - 5716.8] specification of what this Smart Control

[5714.76 - 5719.9800000000005] should be so just this small area of

[5716.8 - 5722.320000000001] application where you have to negotiate

[5719.98 - 5726.04] an agreement between the all the parties

[5722.32 - 5728.739] involved in the contract is is a major

[5726.04 - 5730.84] area of application to me so I I'm much

[5728.739 - 5733.178999999999] more for experimenting but that's just

[5730.84 - 5735.900000000001] me right experimenting this small uh

[5733.179 - 5739.3] confined areas where you can actually

[5735.9 - 5740.98] understand and focus potentially also on

[5739.3 - 5743.1990000000005] problems and make some app in particular

[5740.98 - 5748.0599999999995] social problems that have to be

[5743.199 - 5750.78] understood to to to potentially solve

[5748.06 - 5753.52] the bottlenecks that may arise etc etc

[5750.78 - 5755.32] I'm very fond of all the technical

[5753.52 - 5758.56] solution that we have found that the

[5755.32 - 5761.92] oadden is genius group is is really

[5758.56 - 5764.26] working hard on this uh that is uh the

[5761.92 - 5766.2390000000005] the open problem which is not a problem

[5764.26 - 5768.400000000001] there there is the goal to start

[5766.239 - 5769.718999999999] applying and see these things really in

[5768.4 - 5771.9] the real world deployed in the real

[5769.719 - 5771.9] world

[5772.12 - 5774.4] excellent

[5773.199 - 5776.678999999999] yeah

[5774.4 - 5781.08] um Ohad what's what's your dream short

[5776.679 - 5781.08] short or long-term dream for for Tau

[5782.8 - 5789.28] the cow is all about truth

[5786.42 - 5791.56] it is for people

[5789.28 - 5793.599999999999] like me like us

[5791.56 - 5796.7390000000005] who like the tools who prefer the truth

[5793.6 - 5796.7390000000005] of the false

[5797.02 - 5799.92] um

[5797.62 - 5802.36] I hope to

[5799.92 - 5805.06] that I will bring a little bit more

[5802.36 - 5807.5199999999995] truth to this world to this full of

[5805.06 - 5811.120000000001] life's world

[5807.52 - 5814.719] excellent excellent okay

[5811.12 - 5816.5199999999995] um so we're nearing the end of this

[5814.719 - 5821.38] conversation

[5816.52 - 5822.580000000001] um what are the next steps for for Tau

[5821.38 - 5824.46] um what's what's coming down the

[5822.58 - 5827.0199999999995] pipeline where are we at

[5824.46 - 5829.179] and then how do people get involved

[5827.02 - 5830.9800000000005] let's talk about let's talk about from

[5829.179 - 5833.1990000000005] this day forward what's what's happening

[5830.98 - 5835.419999999999] with Tau and and what is what is the

[5833.199 - 5838.678999999999] level of involvement for people like me

[5835.42 - 5838.679] and and people in our audience

[5842.32 - 5847.0] and for your environment we have a

[5844.42 - 5850.719] community mainly taking place on

[5847.0 - 5852.82] telegram we also have a monthly update

[5850.719 - 5856.659] every every month on YouTube

[5852.82 - 5860.0199999999995] and people can submit their questions

[5856.659 - 5862.659] and for the next steps we are now moving

[5860.02 - 5866.4400000000005] to a finalize and implement the Tau

[5862.659 - 5868.839999999999] language and in parallel and see how to

[5866.44 - 5872.0199999999995] put it as a block acceptance condition

[5868.84 - 5872.860000000001] on a blockchain and finally to start

[5872.02 - 5876.4800000000005] having

[5872.86 - 5876.48] a cell phone ending blockchain

[5876.94 - 5881.138999999999] and so those are the next steps

[5879.82 - 5882.4] excellent

[5881.139 - 5884.92] excellent

[5882.4 - 5888.04] um yeah and and so it's it's it's coming

[5884.92 - 5889.0] to fruition it's about to be uh live on

[5888.04 - 5891.58] the network

[5889.0 - 5893.62] um what are the just as a final question

[5891.58 - 5895.48] what are the what are the key problems

[5893.62 - 5900.28] left to solve if any

[5895.48 - 5901.78] um are there any hurdles or Frank uh it

[5900.28 - 5904.239] seems like you have an idea of what are

[5901.78 - 5905.739] the major problems left to solve well uh

[5904.239 - 5908.138999999999] well it depends on the meaning of the

[5905.739 - 5909.94] word problem so I see interesting

[5908.139 - 5912.28] challenges to still be sold and make

[5909.94 - 5915.0] time making Tau even more powerful

[5912.28 - 5919.12] so I think we have cracked down the main

[5915.0 - 5921.699] issues the main quests by having this

[5919.12 - 5924.099999999999] language that is able in a logic fashion

[5921.699 - 5925.839999999999] to talk about itself to talk about laws

[5924.1 - 5929.1990000000005] that to change the laws the dynamic

[5925.84 - 5931.54] aspects to model software to be very

[5929.199 - 5933.04] powerful and still being decidable so

[5931.54 - 5935.92] that we have terminating correct

[5933.04 - 5938.699] algorithms there are new things that we

[5935.92 - 5942.4] can add to this language new aspects

[5938.699 - 5945.339999999999] to add is on its exclusivity so we

[5942.4 - 5947.199] mentioned I guess briefly that the

[5945.34 - 5948.76] language if we take the most powerful

[5947.199 - 5950.62] language then this would be undecidable

[5948.76 - 5955.4800000000005] so we cannot really hope to implement it

[5950.62 - 5958.659] but we uh taking the the the decidable

[5955.48 - 5961.299999999999] fragment is sort of arbitrary so we took

[5958.659 - 5964.719] One Direction and so we can still hope

[5961.3 - 5968.08] to to give it more potential and

[5964.719 - 5970.06] and then somehow making more interesting

[5968.08 - 5973.239] for several aspects for example to model

[5970.06 - 5975.280000000001] formally the notion of argumentation I

[5973.239 - 5977.199] know there are some aspects in this to

[5975.28 - 5979.54] this sort of game theory that will be

[5977.199 - 5980.799999999999] involved in argumentation could be a

[5979.54 - 5982.54] possible extension of the language there

[5980.8 - 5984.6990000000005] are many many interesting challenges

[5982.54 - 5986.56] which does not mean that we have problem

[5984.699 - 5989.44] these are these are just new things we

[5986.56 - 5991.92] want to to add to the language

[5989.44 - 5994.659] uh so that's okay so just

[5991.92 - 5996.6990000000005] levels of achievement but no there's no

[5994.659 - 5999.04] technical hurdles preventing you from

[5996.699 - 6002.46] moving forward at this point

[5999.04 - 6005.1] well or are there details to be ironed

[6002.46 - 6006.42] out but yeah I guess the main things are

[6005.1 - 6009.42] there yes

[6006.42 - 6009.42] excellent

[6009.84 - 6015.78] and yes I agree indeed

[6012.9 - 6018.0] um you know ongoing effort but we know

[6015.78 - 6020.5199999999995] mathematically that will never end

[6018.0 - 6023.219] is to enhance the expressiveness of the

[6020.52 - 6024.0] language and to have

[6023.219 - 6026.88] um

[6024.0 - 6030.9] a more efficient algorithms

[6026.88 - 6033.2390000000005] okay so expanding expanding expressions

[6030.9 - 6034.799999999999] and optimization

[6033.239 - 6036.839999999999] um but as you said those those that will

[6034.8 - 6039.78] never end that is just part of the

[6036.84 - 6042.4800000000005] ongoing work excellent

[6039.78 - 6044.28] um as any final thoughts um you know one

[6042.48 - 6045.599999999999] or two sentences from from each of you

[6044.28 - 6048.48] any final thoughts that you would like

[6045.6 - 6051.659000000001] the world to know about Tau before we uh

[6048.48 - 6054.9] we close our conversation for the day

[6051.659 - 6057.239] well I can see my my perspective is a

[6054.9 - 6059.638999999999] very uh

[6057.239 - 6062.339999999999] very focused on the technical aspect so

[6059.639 - 6065.159000000001] I'm not really the one that has the the

[6062.34 - 6067.02] the conquer in the world and changing

[6065.159 - 6067.92] the world and pushing for truth in the

[6067.02 - 6069.540000000001] world

[6067.92 - 6072.3] from from that perspective I really

[6069.54 - 6075.42] think that what we have done is really

[6072.3 - 6079.320000000001] magic is a major technical advances in

[6075.42 - 6082.1990000000005] logic and computational logic and this

[6079.32 - 6085.0199999999995] gives the company A major advantage

[6082.199 - 6087.839999999999] business Advantage too because we are

[6085.02 - 6089.52] the only owner so Tau the company is the

[6087.84 - 6091.8] only owner of this technology and so

[6089.52 - 6093.540000000001] they they can do these things and nobody

[6091.8 - 6094.8] still knows how they will get these

[6093.54 - 6097.0199999999995] results

[6094.8 - 6100.619000000001] and which is interesting as well so

[6097.02 - 6103.1990000000005] that's uh and then yeah I really keep

[6100.619 - 6104.099999999999] like to keep going working on with the

[6103.199 - 6107.339999999999] group

[6104.1 - 6110.900000000001] and then to meet these new challenges

[6107.34 - 6110.900000000001] and extensions of the language

[6110.94 - 6117.0199999999995] excellent thank you oh hard any any

[6113.4 - 6117.0199999999995] final thoughts for uh for the world

[6117.9 - 6123.42] um that's how to take it more than 12.

[6121.5 - 6125.58] we want to take software development to

[6123.42 - 6127.7390000000005] the next level

[6125.58 - 6130.38] that much more complex will be able to

[6127.739 - 6133.86] be programmed and controlled by users

[6130.38 - 6135.2390000000005] bring software back to the people

[6133.86 - 6137.759999999999] wonderful

[6135.239 - 6140.339999999999] wonderful well thank you both so very

[6137.76 - 6143.04] much for bringing me into the Tau group

[6140.34 - 6145.4400000000005] and having your folks reach out this has

[6143.04 - 6148.56] been a remarkable set of conversations

[6145.44 - 6150.54] leading up to this and I I get chills

[6148.56 - 6152.639] just thinking about what it is that

[6150.54 - 6154.98] you're doing and and and the the

[6152.639 - 6157.56] long-term implications and just How

[6154.98 - 6160.08] Deeply fascinating and complex it is so

[6157.56 - 6163.139] again thank you for for the The Talk

[6160.08 - 6164.639] today and I look forward to continuing

[6163.139 - 6166.02] those conversations and seeing where

[6164.639 - 6169.1990000000005] everything goes

[6166.02 - 6172.1990000000005] um so thank you thank you to you

[6169.199 - 6174.86] thank you so much cheers

[6172.199 - 6174.86] cheers
