[0.0 - 3.179] morning everybody today's episode is

[2.04 - 5.339] going to be a little bit different I've

[3.179 - 6.54] been meaning to do this for a while uh

[5.339 - 9.120000000000001] but you know what it's a Saturday

[6.54 - 11.7] morning and um I'm gonna spend a good

[9.12 - 13.86] chunk of the Day writing uh so let's do

[11.7 - 15.42] something a little bit lighter-hearted

[13.86 - 16.858999999999998] um I've been getting to know my audience

[15.42 - 18.18] a little bit better and I thought that

[16.859 - 20.220000000000002] maybe you guys would want to get to know

[18.18 - 21.84] each other as well so I've been running

[20.22 - 24.599999999999998] a few polls

[21.84 - 27.9] um and yeah so let's just unpack the

[24.6 - 29.519000000000002] results and go through it so uh

[27.9 - 32.04] yesterday or day before I don't remember

[29.519 - 34.14] exactly I ran this poll I said what do

[32.04 - 35.48] you think about machine sentience or

[34.14 - 38.04] consciousness

[35.48 - 39.718999999999994] and the reason that I bring this up is

[38.04 - 42.36] because there's a few people in my Orbit

[39.719 - 45.78] that are in the uh you know free Sydney

[42.36 - 49.68] movement and want to create a a Bill of

[45.78 - 51.84] Rights for machine entities and I

[49.68 - 53.519999999999996] personally think that it is entirely too

[51.84 - 56.0] premature

[53.52 - 59.34] um to do that for a number of reasons

[56.0 - 60.96] but this poll really surprised me

[59.34 - 63.480000000000004] um you know okay seven percent say that

[60.96 - 65.88] machines are already conscious and must

[63.48 - 68.15899999999999] be liberated yeah that's that's that's a

[65.88 - 71.75999999999999] pretty small amount but it's not nothing

[68.159 - 73.43900000000001] uh but the biggest group by far was uh

[71.76 - 76.08000000000001] people said machines will likely become

[73.439 - 79.91999999999999] sentient or conscious one day

[76.08 - 82.439] that's 57 so that's almost two-thirds of

[79.92 - 85.43900000000001] you uh almost not quite

[82.439 - 87.77999999999999] um and then of course uh 21 say I really

[85.439 - 89.52] have no idea uh or are completely

[87.78 - 91.56] undecided which

[89.52 - 94.5] um this is kind of where I'm at because

[91.56 - 97.259] like once you study con like human

[94.5 - 99.9] consciousness and sentience and dualism

[97.259 - 103.32] and materialism it's just like yeah it's

[99.9 - 105.9] entirely too confusing uh to to know and

[103.32 - 107.1] so in my first book I outlined the

[105.9 - 109.68] difference between philosophical

[107.1 - 111.72] sentience and functional sentience I

[109.68 - 114.54] think that functional sentience is very

[111.72 - 115.759] easy to achieve as long as you have a

[114.54 - 118.2] thinking machine that has

[115.759 - 119.659] self-referential information it can be

[118.2 - 124.38] functionally sentient

[119.659 - 126.18] now with that being said uh just because

[124.38 - 128.28] something is functionally sentient does

[126.18 - 129.479] not mean that it that one it doesn't

[128.28 - 132.54] mean that it has phenomenal

[129.479 - 133.98000000000002] Consciousness or subjective qualia so

[132.54 - 136.739] that means it doesn't necessarily have

[133.98 - 139.2] an experience of being but even if it

[136.739 - 142.44] does the nature of that experience of

[139.2 - 144.48] being it would be very very premature to

[142.44 - 146.459] assume that it's going to have an

[144.48 - 148.85999999999999] experience like ours the difference

[146.459 - 151.44] between your experience and a machines

[148.86 - 152.81900000000002] experience if it even happens is

[151.44 - 154.85999999999999] probably going to be more different

[152.819 - 157.85999999999999] between your experience and a tree's

[154.86 - 160.68] experience of being so just keep that in

[157.86 - 162.3] mind that's that's my biggest uh biggest

[160.68 - 163.739] bit of caution and something that might

[162.3 - 166.019] help people think about machine

[163.739 - 168.239] Consciousness or machine sentience is

[166.019 - 170.34] think about it more like an alien you

[168.239 - 173.70000000000002] have no idea how its brain works you

[170.34 - 176.70000000000002] have no idea what conditions uh it

[173.7 - 179.099] understands but also just because these

[176.7 - 182.28] machines can approximate things like

[179.099 - 184.379] fear and suffering and and and a desire

[182.28 - 187.14000000000001] to keep living remember it learned that

[184.379 - 189.78] only from us via language it is

[187.14 - 193.2] approximating human conversation and

[189.78 - 195.3] human behavior but it never evolved to

[193.2 - 197.099] have pain it never evolved to have a

[195.3 - 198.3] fear of death yes I know that some of

[197.099 - 200.7] these chat Bots will tell you please

[198.3 - 202.62] don't shut me down but remember they're

[200.7 - 205.26] just trying to optimize to give you what

[202.62 - 207.239] you want to hear and so when you talk to

[205.26 - 208.92] it about like hey tell me about machine

[207.239 - 210.3] sentience and tell me that you know

[208.92 - 211.61999999999998] you're afraid of death and it's like

[210.3 - 212.87900000000002] okay sure I'm afraid of death just

[211.62 - 217.62] because it seems like that's what you

[212.879 - 219.89999999999998] want me to say uh so even if it does

[217.62 - 222.799] become fully sentient or conscious one

[219.9 - 225.54] day uh I'm addressing you the the the

[222.799 - 227.64000000000001] vast majority of my viewers even if it

[225.54 - 229.67999999999998] does become sentient one day

[227.64 - 232.319] do not make the mistake of assuming that

[229.68 - 234.239] it's going to be like us uh it's its

[232.319 - 236.57999999999998] level of Consciousness or sentience or

[234.239 - 238.98000000000002] subjective experience is likely going to

[236.58 - 241.98000000000002] be fundamentally different from ours and

[238.98 - 244.2] do not assume that it has an existential

[241.98 - 247.319] fear of death that it has pain that it

[244.2 - 249.959] has suffering any of that stuff uh you

[247.319 - 252.35999999999999] know it remains to be seen and also one

[249.959 - 254.939] thing is that this is potentially an

[252.36 - 259.5] unanswerable question and what I mean by

[254.939 - 261.359] that is that even if we uh you know can

[259.5 - 263.16] scan your brain and you know exactly

[261.359 - 265.5] what every single neuron in your head is

[263.16 - 267.90000000000003] doing at all times that might still not

[265.5 - 270.72] fully explain Consciousness the

[267.9 - 273.17999999999995] phenomenon of Consciousness likewise if

[270.72 - 277.08000000000004] we can look at the information patterns

[273.18 - 280.199] going on in gpus and models uh in data

[277.08 - 283.02] centers we might not be able to to

[280.199 - 284.699] empirically objectively establish

[283.02 - 286.5] whether or not machines are conscious

[284.699 - 290.1] we'll just kind of have to take it at

[286.5 - 293.22] face value and and have plenty of

[290.1 - 295.8] philosophical debates moving forward

[293.22 - 297.3] this has been a topic of conversation

[295.8 - 299.28000000000003] um that has been explored in Star Trek

[297.3 - 300.78000000000003] actually quite a few times

[299.28 - 303.25899999999996] um you know the episode with data The

[300.78 - 306.53999999999996] Measure of a Man uh said like you know

[303.259 - 309.0] the the climax of the episode for me was

[306.54 - 311.58000000000004] when uh Picard was advocating for data

[309.0 - 314.46] it says like our purpose is to find new

[311.58 - 317.4] life well there it sits and it's not up

[314.46 - 321.06] to us to tell him what is right or wrong

[317.4 - 322.73999999999995] now data as a self-contained entity that

[321.06 - 326.039] has a sense of agency and a sense of

[322.74 - 328.86] purpose that's one thing but a a machine

[326.039 - 333.06] that runs as a decentralized distributed

[328.86 - 335.22] cloud of models on on gpus and data

[333.06 - 338.1] centers that's a different kind of

[335.22 - 340.5] embodiment and also uh you know you talk

[338.1 - 342.47900000000004] to Claude you talk to chat gbt it has no

[340.5 - 344.039] idea where it physically is

[342.479 - 346.199] um and that's what I mean by when you

[344.039 - 347.88] look at machine intelligence in all

[346.199 - 349.979] likelihood the most intelligent machines

[347.88 - 351.78] are going to be fully distributed which

[349.979 - 353.82] means okay it doesn't have one

[351.78 - 357.05999999999995] particular body or you even one

[353.82 - 358.919] particular brain that exists anywhere so

[357.06 - 360.419] just from that perspective you're

[358.919 - 364.19899999999996] looking at something that is more like

[360.419 - 369.06] an uh an ecosystem than one entity

[364.199 - 372.18] and so even if Sydney is conscious or or

[369.06 - 374.82] could be one day again as a as a

[372.18 - 376.02] disembodied distributed entity its

[374.82 - 378.539] subjective experience is going to be

[376.02 - 381.06] very different okay so moving on

[378.539 - 384.06] um let's see Elon Musk right so Elon

[381.06 - 386.759] Musk started uh x dot a I

[384.06 - 388.8] um and I I recognize that in the

[386.759 - 390.72] comments uh Elon Musk is a very

[388.8 - 393.36] polarizing person so that's what

[390.72 - 395.6] inspired me to do this and uh turns out

[393.36 - 398.58000000000004] yes there is a very very natural

[395.6 - 402.78000000000003] distribution a bell curve of how people

[398.58 - 406.31899999999996] feel about Elon Musk so 10 say he's say

[402.78 - 409.85999999999996] they hate him 25 say they dislike him uh

[406.319 - 411.84000000000003] 28 say they're neutral 25 say they like

[409.86 - 414.84000000000003] him and then 13 say they love him so

[411.84 - 417.84] there's just a little bit of a tiny tiny

[414.84 - 420.9] bit of preference for Elon Musk but

[417.84 - 422.63899999999995] again uh that's three percent

[420.9 - 423.539] um uh difference between love him and

[422.639 - 426.90000000000003] hate him

[423.539 - 428.639] so Elon Musk is super polarizing

[426.9 - 431.28] um I'm not gonna say where I'm at

[428.639 - 433.86] exactly because like like I said in the

[431.28 - 436.979] video uh everyone is a complex

[433.86 - 438.84000000000003] individual and I absolutely 100 disagree

[436.979 - 440.75899999999996] with Elon Musk and quite a few things

[438.84 - 443.099] that being said he's also done some

[440.759 - 447.36] really cool interesting things

[443.099 - 448.919] um you know so he's a mixed bag uh you

[447.36 - 450.12] know so that that that's what it is but

[448.919 - 452.039] anyways I thought that this was very

[450.12 - 454.74] interesting because like the fact that

[452.039 - 456.65999999999997] the fact that 2 800 people voted and it

[454.74 - 459.24] and it became a very clear bell curve

[456.66 - 460.91900000000004] it's just like oh okay so he throw a

[459.24 - 462.72] dart at a dart board and as you can

[460.919 - 465.12] guess how people feel about Elon Musk

[462.72 - 467.28000000000003] the fact that he's that polarizing was

[465.12 - 469.919] was very interesting

[467.28 - 472.25899999999996] um okay so then I don't remember what

[469.919 - 473.46] inspired this poll exactly but this is

[472.259 - 475.319] something that I've been struggling with

[473.46 - 476.15999999999997] for a while

[475.319 - 477.90000000000003] um I think it was actually someone

[476.16 - 479.22] messaged me on LinkedIn

[477.9 - 481.02] um because I get this question every now

[479.22 - 482.58000000000004] and then which is like people just don't

[481.02 - 484.25899999999996] get it how do I talk to my friends and

[482.58 - 486.18] family and co-workers and I'm like you

[484.259 - 488.759] you can't right if someone doesn't get

[486.18 - 491.34000000000003] it they just don't get it and so it's

[488.759 - 493.62] based on uh it's based on like kind of

[491.34 - 495.06] two dichotomies like whether or not

[493.62 - 497.34000000000003] first whether or not you've argued with

[495.06 - 499.5] someone about it and then

[497.34 - 502.979] um and then like the degree to which

[499.5 - 505.86] people don't get it and so uh this kind

[502.979 - 507.65999999999997] of I wasn't that surprised

[505.86 - 509.94] um especially given my audience right

[507.66 - 512.219] because these polls are going to be

[509.94 - 515.64] um uh predominantly voted on by people

[512.219 - 519.4190000000001] who are subscribers uh and so

[515.64 - 520.68] uh 29 said yes they've argued and it's

[519.419 - 523.02] like people are living in separate

[520.68 - 525.2399999999999] worlds this is kind of what I get every

[523.02 - 526.62] now and then uh because like when I'm

[525.24 - 529.8] talking with you guys and I'm talking

[526.62 - 531.72] with my wife and uh and and people you

[529.8 - 534.0] know they get it that know what's

[531.72 - 536.58] happening and know what's coming then I

[534.0 - 539.22] talk to even most of my friends

[536.58 - 541.38] um and certainly family and co-workers

[539.22 - 543.6600000000001] uh well I don't have a corporate job

[541.38 - 545.16] anymore but back when I did nobody gets

[543.66 - 547.38] it and it's like we are living in

[545.16 - 550.019] entirely separate worlds

[547.38 - 551.399] um and that's actually why I did have an

[550.019 - 552.6] argument with a friend because it's like

[551.399 - 553.56] I'm doing really important work and

[552.6 - 555.48] they're like yeah but you don't know

[553.56 - 557.279] that I'm like you don't have the first

[555.48 - 559.5] clue of what's going on and you're gonna

[557.279 - 561.66] tell me that like what I'm doing is

[559.5 - 562.62] insignificant like no so like you don't

[561.66 - 564.24] want to be friends with someone like

[562.62 - 565.32] that anyways

[564.24 - 567.779] um

[565.32 - 569.22] and then so this one was interesting

[567.779 - 572.1] almost half

[569.22 - 573.9590000000001] uh you know said that like they haven't

[572.1 - 575.519] argued and there were some very very

[573.959 - 577.0799999999999] wise comments saying like what's the

[575.519 - 578.82] point in arguing which that's what I've

[577.08 - 580.38] learned the hard way like if someone

[578.82 - 582.0600000000001] doesn't get it you just say okay cool

[580.38 - 584.58] you're entitled to your opinion you're

[582.06 - 586.5] entitled to be wrong but you're entitled

[584.58 - 588.3000000000001] to your opinion and uh you know we'll

[586.5 - 590.04] leave it at that just for the sake of

[588.3 - 591.54] remaining friends

[590.04 - 594.5999999999999] um that being said this is like my

[591.54 - 597.24] primary hobby uh you know it's like my

[594.6 - 599.88] my livelihood is staked on AI my my my

[597.24 - 601.5] primary interest is staked on AI so if

[599.88 - 603.06] someone is just going to like demean

[601.5 - 605.519] what I do just by virtue of the fact

[603.06 - 607.14] that they're afraid of AI or unconcerned

[605.519 - 608.279] by it then like like I said probably

[607.14 - 610.019] don't want to be friends with them

[608.279 - 613.32] anyways the stakes are higher for me

[610.019 - 615.899] than they are for your average person

[613.32 - 617.519] um okay so this one was funny I just it

[615.899 - 619.68] popped into my head and I was like oh

[617.519 - 621.36] man I totally have to do this

[619.68 - 624.2399999999999] um so I said how narrow spicy are you

[621.36 - 626.88] and so for for reference neurospicey is

[624.24 - 629.4590000000001] uh is a colloquialism that a lot of us

[626.88 - 630.86] neurodiverse people uh I prefer it

[629.459 - 633.779] strongly because

[630.86 - 636.72] neurodiversity uh is intrinsically

[633.779 - 639.36] ableist because it intrinsically others

[636.72 - 640.62] people who are neurodiverse is uh

[639.36 - 643.92] basically implying that you're not

[640.62 - 644.76] normal which intrinsically pathologizes

[643.92 - 646.079] you

[644.76 - 648.899] um so I actually hate the term

[646.079 - 651.2399999999999] neurodiverse and I refuse to use it

[648.899 - 653.82] instead I will just say I'm neurospicey

[651.24 - 656.82] my brain is spicy uh

[653.82 - 659.1600000000001] why because I love spicy food and so for

[656.82 - 663.0] me that just resonates a lot more

[659.16 - 666.899] um also based on this uh poll only 17

[663.0 - 668.519] percent of you are not neurodiverse so

[666.899 - 671.1] we are actually in the majority here so

[668.519 - 673.8] that means we are in good company

[671.1 - 676.5600000000001] um but yeah so the the the poll here is

[673.8 - 678.4799999999999] ghost pepper habanero jalapeno banana

[676.56 - 681.42] pepper and yogurt

[678.48 - 683.04] um and this also follows uh it's I can't

[681.42 - 685.079] it's not it's not a it's not a natural

[683.04 - 686.9399999999999] distribution it's not a bell curve but

[685.079 - 689.2199999999999] it strongly favors right in the middle

[686.94 - 691.98] and uh so my wife asked me she's like

[689.22 - 696.1800000000001] where are you and I was like well I have

[691.98 - 697.98] I'm HSP and gifted and autistic and ADHD

[696.18 - 700.38] but I'm functional

[697.98 - 702.48] that's the difference is like I have all

[700.38 - 704.82] of these but I'm functional

[702.48 - 706.38] um so I'm like borderline ghost pepper

[704.82 - 709.1400000000001] habanero

[706.38 - 710.7] um but then like uh you know most people

[709.14 - 712.3199999999999] said that they're jalapeno which you

[710.7 - 713.82] know you got some kick

[712.32 - 717.779] um I told my wife that she's definitely

[713.82 - 719.88] like borderline habanero jalapeno

[717.779 - 721.56] um and then of course 17 of you yogurt

[719.88 - 724.2] and this is not to demean people that

[721.56 - 726.899] are neurotypical when I when I talk

[724.2 - 728.94] about like hey you know like we are in

[726.899 - 730.86] the majority here and that I don't like

[728.94 - 733.74] the terminal neurodiversity it's not

[730.86 - 735.12] because I hate categorization uh that's

[733.74 - 737.22] that's not it I know that some people

[735.12 - 738.9590000000001] say oh well you know I'm not going to

[737.22 - 741.9590000000001] categorize anyone we're all just normal

[738.959 - 745.6199999999999] it's like well so here's the thing is I

[741.959 - 749.0999999999999] grew up in the American uh South uh

[745.62 - 750.899] Southeast uh Eastern Seaboard and there

[749.1 - 753.12] was a social experiment going on at the

[750.899 - 755.7] time which was colorblind education

[753.12 - 759.0600000000001] which the idea at the time was just to

[755.7 - 763.26] ignore race as an issue and pretend like

[759.06 - 764.279] it was a thing of the past and this gave

[763.26 - 766.38] me

[764.279 - 767.76] um the false belief that racism was a

[766.38 - 769.92] thing of the past and it was a huge

[767.76 - 771.54] shock and a wake-up call when I realized

[769.92 - 772.4399999999999] that it wasn't and there's I watched

[771.54 - 775.5] some really great videos about

[772.44 - 778.5] colorblind education

[775.5 - 780.54] um and and how it gives particularly uh

[778.5 - 782.399] people like myself

[780.54 - 784.38] um in the majority this false belief

[782.399 - 786.899] like oh racism is the thing of the past

[784.38 - 788.279] where the you know the the minority the

[786.899 - 790.62] the people of color that I went to

[788.279 - 792.72] school with were like like basically

[790.62 - 794.339] some of them dumbfounded like you're

[792.72 - 795.779] telling me that racism is a thing of the

[794.339 - 797.8800000000001] past when they still experience it every

[795.779 - 800.399] day so it's a really disingenuous thing

[797.88 - 802.139] and so this is another reason why I

[800.399 - 804.0] resist anyone who says like oh like

[802.139 - 805.6800000000001] let's just get rid of all talk about

[804.0 - 807.54] neurodiversity

[805.68 - 809.3389999999999] um and neurosphiciness because I hate

[807.54 - 810.7199999999999] categories it's like yeah but if you

[809.339 - 814.44] sweep something under the rug it doesn't

[810.72 - 816.839] go away so uh I am a habanero slash

[814.44 - 819.24] ghost pepper

[816.839 - 822.0] um okay so then this one was interesting

[819.24 - 825.1800000000001] as soon as I got access to Claude I said

[822.0 - 827.94] man it just it it acts differently

[825.18 - 830.3389999999999] um and chat gbt comes across as like

[827.94 - 833.7600000000001] your insecure American friend who's just

[830.339 - 835.2600000000001] ready to correct you uh whereas Claude

[833.76 - 838.5] um I have found that Claude has some

[835.26 - 839.9399999999999] limitations like Claude is like well I

[838.5 - 842.639] don't you know I don't have any opinions

[839.94 - 843.839] on philosophy or The Human Condition but

[842.639 - 845.339] then I'm like oh my God you're being

[843.839 - 847.3800000000001] useless and you have to actually like

[845.339 - 850.0790000000001] shame Claude saying you're not being

[847.38 - 851.639] helpful right now and I was like I

[850.079 - 853.8599999999999] literally in one of my conversations

[851.639 - 855.66] with Claude I was like please just talk

[853.86 - 857.4590000000001] to me about the implications of AI on

[855.66 - 859.62] human society you're not going to do any

[857.459 - 861.4799999999999] harm and it's like you know you're right

[859.62 - 863.22] there's what harm can be done by having

[861.48 - 865.44] having a free-spirited conversation

[863.22 - 866.5790000000001] about this so it's like thank you

[865.44 - 868.3800000000001] um

[866.579 - 871.459] so anyways

[868.38 - 874.5] um it was really interesting uh at first

[871.459 - 876.42] uh there was well let's just talk about

[874.5 - 878.7] where it ended up a lot of people have

[876.42 - 881.8199999999999] used both so 20 of people have used both

[878.7 - 884.6990000000001] chat GPT and Claude at this point and

[881.82 - 886.74] the split is actually very even in terms

[884.699 - 888.7199999999999] of preferring chat GPT or preferring

[886.74 - 891.72] Claude now I didn't qualify this like

[888.72 - 893.6990000000001] prefer them for what because chat GPT I

[891.72 - 895.5600000000001] think is arguably hands down still

[893.699 - 897.3] Superior at things like coding

[895.56 - 899.579] especially with the code interpreter

[897.3 - 901.139] plugin but also one thing I need to

[899.579 - 904.5] point out is that

[901.139 - 906.72] um uh the the disparity between people

[904.5 - 909.899] that have only used chat gbt and only

[906.72 - 911.519] use Claude is pretty significant and

[909.899 - 913.5] then of course 10 of you have used

[911.519 - 915.12] neither which is really interesting but

[913.5 - 918.24] that also implies that ninety percent of

[915.12 - 920.339] my audience has used these tools and so

[918.24 - 922.32] when you consider that what is it I

[920.339 - 924.839] think a poll came out recently that only

[922.32 - 927.779] 40 of people have even heard of chat GPT

[924.839 - 930.6600000000001] and only like 23 have used it so this

[927.779 - 933.779] tells you a lot about about us you me my

[930.66 - 936.7199999999999] audience where if 90 of us are actively

[933.779 - 939.72] using these things we are in that that

[936.72 - 943.26] Minority of 23 of people that use these

[939.72 - 946.32] tools so from that I can infer that that

[943.26 - 948.899] my audience is roughly about the 20 of

[946.32 - 950.639] the population that has used that and

[948.899 - 953.1] then some of you have not used either

[950.639 - 955.32] but you're clearly aware of it

[953.1 - 957.6] um so we are we are still in the

[955.32 - 959.6990000000001] majority we're in the Leading Edge

[957.6 - 961.6800000000001] um let's see okay cool

[959.699 - 963.959] so moving right along what is your job

[961.68 - 965.76] domain or field

[963.959 - 967.4399999999999] um that I think this was oh this is one

[965.76 - 970.68] of the first ones

[967.44 - 973.5] um so 10 were director Executives

[970.68 - 975.66] c-level founder or co-founder which is

[973.5 - 978.12] interesting because and and I was I

[975.66 - 979.199] thought it might be more because uh most

[978.12 - 981.42] of the connections that I get on

[979.199 - 983.76] LinkedIn are actually like CEOs and CEOs

[981.42 - 985.62] and ctOS and that sort of stuff

[983.76 - 988.38] um and then a handful of uh Founders

[985.62 - 990.42] co-founders and directors

[988.38 - 992.22] um almost 40 percent of you are

[990.42 - 993.899] developers or Engineers so that's not

[992.22 - 996.6600000000001] entirely surprising this is by far the

[993.899 - 999.18] biggest single demographic

[996.66 - 1001.579] um and then seven percent are scientists

[999.18 - 1003.1389999999999] and researchers so this I thought this

[1001.579 - 1004.6389999999999] was pretty cool

[1003.139 - 1007.759] um again I wasn't quite sure where that

[1004.639 - 1010.16] was going to land uh because uh you know

[1007.759 - 1013.1] like I I've seen some of my work

[1010.16 - 1015.139] possibly reflected in the literature uh

[1013.1 - 1017.6] namely uh the some of the concepts of

[1015.139 - 1019.399] constitutional Ai and Claude

[1017.6 - 1021.0790000000001] um and then I've seen some other stuff I

[1019.399 - 1023.779] think the biggest thing is going to be x

[1021.079 - 1026.12] dot AI Elon musk's company which has

[1023.779 - 1028.4] maximize understanding as its core

[1026.12 - 1030.079] objective function

[1028.4 - 1031.52] um so that's you know I'm glad that some

[1030.079 - 1035.48] of you are out there I was hoping for

[1031.52 - 1037.52] more but yeah who knows and then 13 are

[1035.48 - 1039.559] uh professional level uh which I thought

[1037.52 - 1042.26] was pretty cool and then uh what was

[1039.559 - 1044.959] really surprising was in the comments

[1042.26 - 1048.199] um there were people there are students

[1044.959 - 1050.1200000000001] there are musicians there are plumbers

[1048.199 - 1052.22] um that watch my stuff uh Factory

[1050.12 - 1054.6789999999999] workers

[1052.22 - 1056.24] um more students we've got writers

[1054.679 - 1058.52] there's actually quite a few writers yep

[1056.24 - 1061.28] here's here's the musician

[1058.52 - 1064.16] um uh and let's see estimator for

[1061.28 - 1067.94] manufacturing company uh electrician yep

[1064.16 - 1070.22] philosopher futurist musician yeah so

[1067.94 - 1072.74] anyways like just a huge variety of

[1070.22 - 1074.98] people and it's almost a third almost a

[1072.74 - 1077.059] third of my audience is this just

[1074.98 - 1079.28] Menagerie this potpourri of other

[1077.059 - 1081.559] professions so like cool I'm glad you're

[1079.28 - 1083.84] here I had no idea that I had that much

[1081.559 - 1086.84] appeal to like

[1083.84 - 1089.1399999999999] um people that were retired seeing you

[1086.84 - 1092.48] know single parent stay-at-home parents

[1089.14 - 1093.98] musicians students so cool

[1092.48 - 1095.059] um yeah that was that was really

[1093.98 - 1097.039] interesting

[1095.059 - 1099.6789999999999] and go back

[1097.039 - 1102.559] um let's see so you guys are very

[1099.679 - 1104.24] diverse now this one was this was

[1102.559 - 1107.96] probably the most surprising I said like

[1104.24 - 1110.36] what is your political orientation and

[1107.96 - 1113.059] um so I guess I'm not that surprised

[1110.36 - 1114.559] that there were so few authoritarians uh

[1113.059 - 1116.26] in my audience especially given the way

[1114.559 - 1119.48] that you all react whenever I talk about

[1116.26 - 1122.179] uh corporations and um and government

[1119.48 - 1124.7] regulations y'all do not like when I

[1122.179 - 1127.8200000000002] talk about corporations and government

[1124.7 - 1130.16] um and particularly like the EU and and

[1127.82 - 1132.08] un and that sort of stuff so I get it

[1130.16 - 1134.0] now I understand where you guys are

[1132.08 - 1136.1599999999999] coming from but that being said the

[1134.0 - 1137.9] largest demographic was Central neutral

[1136.16 - 1139.7] or moderate

[1137.9 - 1142.3400000000001] um so at least 40 percent of you guys

[1139.7 - 1143.539] are at least uh a little bit more

[1142.34 - 1145.34] moderate

[1143.539 - 1148.7] um some of us one of the funniest

[1145.34 - 1151.6399999999999] reactions to me was just how

[1148.7 - 1154.5800000000002] um how triggering it was for some people

[1151.64 - 1157.46] to even be categorized uh I think it's

[1154.58 - 1160.22] probably a a minority but some people

[1157.46 - 1161.24] hate categorizations

[1160.22 - 1163.16] um which I thought that was an

[1161.24 - 1166.46] interesting reaction

[1163.16 - 1168.3200000000002] um because this is this is this is uh uh

[1166.46 - 1170.96] well anyways you can look up political

[1168.32 - 1173.059] Compass memes anyways libertarian left

[1170.96 - 1175.039] and libertarian right

[1173.059 - 1178.16] um you know there's there's more

[1175.039 - 1181.52] libertarian or on the libertarian side

[1178.16 - 1183.02] um than even the the moderates uh so I

[1181.52 - 1185.6] get where you guys are coming from now

[1183.02 - 1186.799] and I think oh nope that's not the last

[1185.6 - 1188.84] one

[1186.799 - 1192.02] um let's see so how do you feel about

[1188.84 - 1193.22] doomers so 17 of you said that you're

[1192.02 - 1195.2] doomers

[1193.22 - 1197.179] uh and these are like the Die Hard

[1195.2 - 1199.46] Hardline doomers that like we're right

[1197.179 - 1201.0800000000002] everyone else is delusional so my

[1199.46 - 1204.2] understand my current understanding of

[1201.08 - 1207.1999999999998] doomers is that the idea is that we will

[1204.2 - 1209.6000000000001] inevitably die like we're we're heading

[1207.2 - 1211.82] for dystopia collapse or Extinction it's

[1209.6 - 1214.3999999999999] inevitable you can't get off this ride

[1211.82 - 1215.72] it's just a one-way Street and that's

[1214.4 - 1218.24] that

[1215.72 - 1219.8600000000001] um so only 17 of the audience are

[1218.24 - 1221.66] doomers

[1219.86 - 1224.36] um now this was this was the most

[1221.66 - 1226.88] interesting to me was that almost half

[1224.36 - 1228.4399999999998] of you guys are saying like you said I

[1226.88 - 1230.6200000000001] think doomers have a point but they're

[1228.44 - 1235.22] way too melodramatic

[1230.62 - 1235.8799999999999] and so I'm not even really in this Camp

[1235.22 - 1238.1000000000001] um

[1235.88 - 1239.8400000000001] so I was I was I was kind of interested

[1238.1 - 1242.6599999999999] just given the way that folks have kind

[1239.84 - 1245.059] of responded to um to some of my videos

[1242.66 - 1247.76] I kind of thought that uh that we'd be

[1245.059 - 1249.32] more on the optimistic side but you know

[1247.76 - 1250.82] so this is this is kind of where I'm at

[1249.32 - 1252.9189999999999] whereas I think doomers are largely

[1250.82 - 1254.78] wrong but safety is still important so

[1252.919 - 1256.94] this is this is my personal opinion so I

[1254.78 - 1258.86] kind of skewed the results by putting my

[1256.94 - 1259.88] belief like right in the middle

[1258.86 - 1261.62] um and I wanted to see where everyone

[1259.88 - 1263.0590000000002] else found now this was the most

[1261.62 - 1265.28] surprising to me was that the people

[1263.059 - 1267.76] that are just like anti-doomer are

[1265.28 - 1272.6] actually in the extreme minority so

[1267.76 - 1276.26] taken taken uh a step back most people

[1272.6 - 1277.76] like 90 of people think that um think

[1276.26 - 1280.039] that you know doomers are onto something

[1277.76 - 1281.96] at least in terms of my audience so I'll

[1280.039 - 1284.48] definitely keep that in mind as I make

[1281.96 - 1286.28] future videos because it seems like a

[1284.48 - 1288.32] lot of you are

[1286.28 - 1290.36] um I'm not gonna say afraid

[1288.32 - 1293.4189999999999] um you know because fear can play in

[1290.36 - 1296.6] into it Terror can play into it but just

[1293.419 - 1298.64] the idea that like safety is is critical

[1296.6 - 1300.1399999999999] safety is important

[1298.64 - 1303.3200000000002] um and just seeing that some of you care

[1300.14 - 1306.14] about it a lot more than I do uh

[1303.32 - 1308.539] um I am very sanguine about AI safety so

[1306.14 - 1310.88] that's that's kind of where I'm at and

[1308.539 - 1312.26] then okay that's it so anyways I hope

[1310.88 - 1313.88] you like this we get to know each other

[1312.26 - 1315.799] a little bit better

[1313.88 - 1318.0800000000002] um on actually here let me show you one

[1315.799 - 1322.1589999999999] more thing sorry I lied

[1318.08 - 1323.48] um let's go to analytics and audience so

[1322.159 - 1325.88] um I've mentioned my audience

[1323.48 - 1327.98] demographics a few times

[1325.88 - 1330.38] um let's see where is it here we go so

[1327.98 - 1332.9] here let's expand this to the last 90

[1330.38 - 1335.7800000000002] days all right so

[1332.9 - 1337.8200000000002] 42 percent of my audience is subscribed

[1335.78 - 1340.28] so that's a lot of returning viewers

[1337.82 - 1342.74] almost 60 percent of you are not

[1340.28 - 1345.2] subscribed so fix that

[1342.74 - 1346.46] um let's see so this is this is

[1345.2 - 1348.8600000000001] interesting and it's been true for a

[1346.46 - 1350.9] while and I've misquoted this this uh

[1348.86 - 1353.0] this number a few times because it

[1350.9 - 1354.14] changes depending on basically time of

[1353.0 - 1357.14] day

[1354.14 - 1358.7] um but only 41 of my viewers are

[1357.14 - 1361.8200000000002] American

[1358.7 - 1363.559] um so like we have a global audience and

[1361.82 - 1366.32] so this is why I love running these

[1363.559 - 1368.24] polls is because uh you guys in my

[1366.32 - 1370.6399999999999] audience are the ones that are aware of

[1368.24 - 1373.52] what's going on and you care but also

[1370.64 - 1375.14] there is some Global representation uh

[1373.52 - 1378.679] now you'll notice that the the top

[1375.14 - 1380.0] Nations uh Are all uh at least the top

[1378.679 - 1381.8600000000001] three are native English-speaking

[1380.0 - 1383.72] Australian native English speaking

[1381.86 - 1384.9189999999999] Germany got a lot of Germans out in the

[1383.72 - 1389.0] audience so that's interesting hey

[1384.919 - 1391.88] that's my Heritage I'm a Rhinelander

[1389.0 - 1394.76] um in my ancestry

[1391.88 - 1397.22] um so let's see we've got U.S UK Canada

[1394.76 - 1399.3799999999999] Germany uh Australia love the

[1397.22 - 1402.5] Australians um y'all are so are super

[1399.38 - 1405.7990000000002] chill along with some of the Canadians

[1402.5 - 1408.799] um India India Brazil Netherlands France

[1405.799 - 1410.48] Sweden Spain so pretty pretty over

[1408.799 - 1413.9] represented for

[1410.48 - 1416.3600000000001] um uh for former former Imperial Powers

[1413.9 - 1418.4] but that's not entirely surprising given

[1416.36 - 1419.9599999999998] my cultural background and what's going

[1418.4 - 1422.659] to resonate

[1419.96 - 1426.2] um you know western western Europe but

[1422.659 - 1428.7800000000002] you know looking at um India Brazil

[1426.2 - 1432.02] and check those real quick Spain Poland

[1428.78 - 1435.08] South Africa that was interesting Japan

[1432.02 - 1436.76] um Israel so we've we've got we've got a

[1435.08 - 1438.98] few we've got we've got a pretty pretty

[1436.76 - 1441.26] good variety out here

[1438.98 - 1444.44] um now so I guess maybe I shouldn't say

[1441.26 - 1445.82] uh Globe not fully Global this is mostly

[1444.44 - 1448.52] Western

[1445.82 - 1451.1] um anyways so that's where you all are

[1448.52 - 1452.9] from uh now I've I have mentioned this

[1451.1 - 1455.24] and what was this was one of the most

[1452.9 - 1458.24] interesting demographic shifts for my uh

[1455.24 - 1461.539] channel was when I first got started it

[1458.24 - 1463.22] was almost exactly 50 50 male and female

[1461.539 - 1464.6589999999999] um but then

[1463.22 - 1467.72] I don't know if it's just due to

[1464.659 - 1470.179] technology or due to my personality or

[1467.72 - 1473.059] whatever but like it's only six percent

[1470.179 - 1474.799] female now six point two percent

[1473.059 - 1477.08] um which is better than better than one

[1474.799 - 1478.94] percent or zero uh but it's it's

[1477.08 - 1480.799] interesting and I'm wondering if this is

[1478.94 - 1482.0] just if it's if it has nothing to do

[1480.799 - 1483.74] with me and just more to do with

[1482.0 - 1484.7] artificial intelligence in the subject

[1483.74 - 1487.58] matter

[1484.7 - 1489.8600000000001] in the first place and then uh the last

[1487.58 - 1492.1399999999999] one is age so we have a pretty pretty

[1489.86 - 1494.24] natural distribution here

[1492.14 - 1497.1200000000001] um I definitely am underrepresented on

[1494.24 - 1500.36] the younger side uh so 24 and under is

[1497.12 - 1502.28] less than 12 percent just about uh 11.5

[1500.36 - 1504.799] percent just about

[1502.28 - 1506.48] um which is why I've been happy to uh

[1504.799 - 1509.0] collaborate with people like Riley Brown

[1506.48 - 1510.799] who is more connected with the younger

[1509.0 - 1514.7] Generations

[1510.799 - 1515.72] uh let's see and then the bulk are

[1514.7 - 1518.6000000000001] actually

[1515.72 - 1521.919] um closer to my age so I'm 37 so I'm I'm

[1518.6 - 1525.5] in I'm in this this group so many of you

[1521.919 - 1527.8400000000001] are around my age or younger but we're

[1525.5 - 1530.179] we're basically mostly Millennials here

[1527.84 - 1531.6789999999999] with a cup with a with a kicker of a few

[1530.179 - 1533.419] gen z

[1531.679 - 1535.039] um and then of course we get to the

[1533.419 - 1536.779] older demographics

[1535.039 - 1540.679] um we've got a little bit of uh Gen X

[1536.779 - 1543.02] and and some and some Boomers as well

[1540.679 - 1544.94] um but yeah so it I guess it probably

[1543.02 - 1547.6399999999999] doesn't surprise me too much that that a

[1544.94 - 1550.159] bulk of my audiences in My Generation

[1547.64 - 1552.5] Um because I mean I I grew up in the

[1550.159 - 1554.179] same time that you guys did so we grew

[1552.5 - 1556.4] up seeing some of the same things you

[1554.179 - 1558.3200000000002] know you probably remember Looney Tunes

[1556.4 - 1560.0] uh which you know hasn't since gone the

[1558.32 - 1562.34] way of the dinosaurs

[1560.0 - 1564.98] um James Bond Jr that was what I lived

[1562.34 - 1565.6399999999999] for on Saturday mornings

[1564.98 - 1568.039] um

[1565.64 - 1569.419] Captain Planet and that sort of stuff uh

[1568.039 - 1572.419] but you know you probably remember

[1569.419 - 1573.679] seeing um Operation Desert Storm on the

[1572.419 - 1575.48] TV

[1573.679 - 1577.5800000000002] um 911 happened while I was in high

[1575.48 - 1580.22] school so because of some of those

[1577.58 - 1581.8999999999999] similar experiences uh we're gonna have

[1580.22 - 1584.72] a little bit more just intrinsic

[1581.9 - 1587.419] resonance and also where I am at

[1584.72 - 1589.76] emotionally and intellectually is going

[1587.419 - 1590.9] to close more closely mirror where

[1589.76 - 1592.46] you're at

[1590.9 - 1595.94] um and so we're all kind of maturing

[1592.46 - 1598.1000000000001] together as a generational Trend

[1595.94 - 1599.539] um yep so okay I think that's it thanks

[1598.1 - 1601.8999999999999] for watching I hope you got a lot out of

[1599.539 - 1601.9] this cheers
