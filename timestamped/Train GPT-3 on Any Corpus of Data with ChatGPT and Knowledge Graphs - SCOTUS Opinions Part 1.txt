[4.259 - 9.48] hey everybody David Shapiro here uh back

[7.14 - 11.28] after a Hiatus

[9.48 - 13.74] um I've got a lot going on you'll be

[11.28 - 16.56] excited for some news coming up

[13.74 - 19.44] um first I want to address

[16.56 - 21.72] um a big elephant in the room I just put

[19.44 - 23.400000000000002] most of my videos back online

[21.72 - 24.96] um this comes after of course making a

[23.4 - 26.34] recent video explaining why I took them

[24.96 - 28.8] down

[26.34 - 31.08] um I did leave some of my videos down

[28.8 - 33.18] some of my code down but most of them

[31.08 - 36.36] are back up uh both videos and

[33.18 - 38.28] repositories So after talking with

[36.36 - 41.219] people I figured out like striking the

[38.28 - 43.86] balance between creating tools that will

[41.219 - 45.84] help people rather than replace people

[43.86 - 48.12] it's inevitable that things are going to

[45.84 - 50.940000000000005] change but

[48.12 - 52.86] you know a tool is a tool right and it's

[50.94 - 54.959999999999994] anyways I don't need to get lost in it

[52.86 - 56.699] go watch the other video so

[54.96 - 59.039] now that I'm back

[56.699 - 60.48] um it's time to get my get our hands

[59.039 - 61.739000000000004] dirty again so one of the questions that

[60.48 - 66.42] pops up a lot

[61.739 - 68.58] is people want to train gpt3 on how do I

[66.42 - 70.08] how do I do how do I fine-tune a

[68.58 - 71.64] question answering bot so that I can

[70.08 - 74.58] talk about I think someone asked about

[71.64 - 75.479] like the the case law in Argentina or

[74.58 - 77.7] something

[75.479 - 80.15899999999999] um I don't have that data but the short

[77.7 - 81.60000000000001] answer is you don't fine tuning doesn't

[80.159 - 84.42] work that way

[81.6 - 87.17999999999999] um so fine-tuning is about teaching it a

[84.42 - 89.46000000000001] structure you do not teach it with uh

[87.18 - 91.82000000000001] you don't teach it new knowledge with

[89.46 - 96.36] fine tuning what you do is you teach it

[91.82 - 98.27999999999999] patterns so chat GPT is a pattern so the

[96.36 - 101.22] pattern is I ask a question and it

[98.28 - 102.72] writes a response like that you and then

[101.22 - 104.28] you ask a follow-up question and it

[102.72 - 107.4] writes another wall of text

[104.28 - 110.04] that's the pattern Chad gbt was not

[107.4 - 111.96000000000001] taught anything new it's only taught new

[110.04 - 114.47900000000001] stuff when you retrain the underlying

[111.96 - 116.15899999999999] model you can't do that it's way too

[114.479 - 117.0] expensive to retrain the underlying

[116.159 - 119.60000000000001] model

[117.0 - 119.6] so

[119.64 - 124.74] I figured let's pick something that will

[121.74 - 127.259] be a good Exemplar of this so just to do

[124.74 - 130.619] a quick recap the the Genesis of this

[127.259 - 132.54] whole this whole project was that people

[130.619 - 134.459] ask for

[132.54 - 136.67999999999998] um how do you fine-tune

[134.459 - 140.099] um a question answering thing that will

[136.68 - 141.72] you know do case law or any kind of

[140.099 - 144.06] knowledge base right

[141.72 - 145.5] um it's all the same behind under the

[144.06 - 148.08] hood right you have a collection of

[145.5 - 150.66] documents wherever they happen to be how

[148.08 - 152.94000000000003] do I do QA against that with gpt3 so

[150.66 - 155.28] here we go I already have one one that

[152.94 - 157.2] was um answering complex questions from

[155.28 - 158.58] multiple documents but this is a little

[157.2 - 159.83999999999997] bit different

[158.58 - 162.3] um because there's there's going to be a

[159.84 - 165.06] few steps to this so anyways to show you

[162.3 - 167.87900000000002] what I mean I went over to chatgpt

[165.06 - 169.5] and um I said what is the kind of law

[167.879 - 171.599] system where law is established by

[169.5 - 173.519] precedent and it says this is the common

[171.599 - 176.76] law system and they this is opposed to

[173.519 - 178.92000000000002] civil law so common law means that a

[176.76 - 180.84] Supreme Court decision kind of sets the

[178.92 - 182.95899999999997] law of the land so if you want to

[180.84 - 185.64000000000001] understand the American

[182.959 - 188.22] legal system you really need to

[185.64 - 190.2] understand case law and more often than

[188.22 - 191.879] not it comes down to Supreme Court

[190.2 - 193.98] decisions because that is the highest

[191.879 - 195.35999999999999] court in the land so they set the tone

[193.98 - 198.29999999999998] for everything so Supreme Court

[195.36 - 201.12] decisions really teach you how

[198.3 - 204.36] it works so

[201.12 - 207.54] um I went over to a Library of Congress

[204.36 - 209.4] and I found that uh you can download uh

[207.54 - 212.459] all Supreme Court opinions and they're

[209.4 - 215.70000000000002] grouped by uh by by case topic they're

[212.459 - 217.14000000000001] also grouped by um volume or justice but

[215.7 - 218.64] by topic that's going to be more

[217.14 - 221.27999999999997] relevant right because let's imagine

[218.64 - 223.14] that you're an Anti-Trust lawyer and

[221.28 - 224.879] you're an Anti-Trust lawyer and you want

[223.14 - 227.94] to say give me everything about

[224.879 - 230.22] antitrust law I need to know everything

[227.94 - 231.48] that there is about

[230.22 - 233.76] you know

[231.48 - 236.159] um about this so that I understand the

[233.76 - 239.04] legal precedent right because on the one

[236.159 - 241.07999999999998] hand there's established procedures

[239.04 - 242.519] right there's procedural things

[241.08 - 244.26000000000002] um oh and I know all this because my

[242.519 - 246.59900000000002] fiance's cousin is training to be a

[244.26 - 247.85999999999999] lawyer and um when they come visit uh

[246.599 - 249.17999999999998] this is what we talk about because we're

[247.86 - 251.64000000000001] nerds

[249.18 - 253.68] um so there's all kinds of procedural

[251.64 - 255.77999999999997] stuff that I don't even remember but

[253.68 - 258.72] there's there you know uh the idea is

[255.78 - 260.88] that when you have rule by law it is all

[258.72 - 262.91900000000004] about procedure and protocol rather than

[260.88 - 264.71999999999997] emotions so we actually have a very

[262.919 - 266.15999999999997] stoic system where it's we're going to

[264.72 - 267.3] think through this we're going to look

[266.16 - 269.34000000000003] at the letter of the law we're going to

[267.3 - 271.02000000000004] have an impartial system

[269.34 - 273.65999999999997] um of course when you have an impartial

[271.02 - 275.75899999999996] system that requires expert navigation

[273.66 - 278.28000000000003] that automatically privileges people

[275.759 - 279.72] with access to lawyers AKA people with

[278.28 - 282.71999999999997] training or money

[279.72 - 284.82000000000005] privilege is a whole other topic anyways

[282.72 - 286.02000000000004] the system is there it's a very sober

[284.82 - 287.759] system

[286.02 - 290.03999999999996] um where it's about like let's let's

[287.759 - 291.41900000000004] let's read through the established

[290.04 - 293.16] protocols if you're a friend of the

[291.419 - 294.96] court and stuff I watch legal eagle too

[293.16 - 297.06] legal eagle is great

[294.96 - 300.84] um so anyways all that kind of stuff

[297.06 - 304.38] that's fine but interpreting established

[300.84 - 306.78] law common law uh or case law is a whole

[304.38 - 309.3] is a very specific topic so let's take

[306.78 - 311.75899999999996] antitrust law where uh let's see how

[309.3 - 314.16] many did it say Anti-Trust so there's

[311.759 - 316.86] 362 documents they're all available

[314.16 - 318.84000000000003] online as PDFs they've been scanned and

[316.86 - 320.82] I believe they've also all been ocr'd so

[318.84 - 323.34] let's take a quick look close some of

[320.82 - 326.52] these um Superfluous ones

[323.34 - 327.59999999999997] um yeah so PDF 661

[326.52 - 330.06] um yeah you don't have something that's

[327.6 - 331.86] this long and yeah so you you highlight

[330.06 - 333.479] it you see that it's OCR

[331.86 - 335.699] so that means we should be able to

[333.479 - 337.919] scrape it even though it was scanned

[335.699 - 339.84000000000003] excuse me a scanned an ocr'd so we

[337.919 - 343.79999999999995] should be able to get this information

[339.84 - 346.85999999999996] so let me go ahead over here to uh

[343.8 - 348.3] opinions opinions PDF so we'll save this

[346.86 - 350.639] one

[348.3 - 352.56] um and then actually what I put it in

[350.639 - 356.28000000000003] the wrong folder so you might have seen

[352.56 - 360.18] I had a recent document scraping uh

[356.28 - 362.039] video so this is whoops come back this

[360.18 - 363.78000000000003] is uh this is the lead up to that this

[362.039 - 365.699] is why you need something like document

[363.78 - 367.919] scraping is because

[365.699 - 371.40000000000003] um oh I forgot to the the whole reason

[367.919 - 373.68] this is is uh I went and asked uh chat

[371.4 - 376.13899999999995] GPT say tell me about this this this

[373.68 - 377.639] case law and it said I don't know what

[376.139 - 380.40000000000003] you're talking about this sounds like

[377.639 - 381.18] it's a real case so it's like okay cool

[380.4 - 382.5] um

[381.18 - 383.94] you know it tells me about the

[382.5 - 387.06] identification I said it was a Supreme

[383.94 - 388.259] Court case decided in 1953 it still

[387.06 - 390.72] doesn't know it right because it's not

[388.259 - 392.46000000000004] connected to any external data source so

[390.72 - 395.28000000000003] one of the biggest weaknesses of chat

[392.46 - 396.84] GPT is that it's a mind in a bottle it

[395.28 - 399.539] has no contact with the outside world

[396.84 - 401.94] the only way that chat GPT can interact

[399.539 - 404.4] with anything is via this chat interface

[401.94 - 406.74] now from an architectural standpoint

[404.4 - 409.44] that's not actually that difficult to

[406.74 - 411.539] fix but you introduce a whole lot of new

[409.44 - 414.06] problems especially when you consider

[411.539 - 415.919] the fact that there are like billions of

[414.06 - 418.139] terabytes of text Data out there to

[415.919 - 420.35999999999996] search and a lot of it isn't accessible

[418.139 - 422.58] because it's in PDFs or private

[420.36 - 424.44] databases or something so you need to

[422.58 - 426.08] have a link between the model the

[424.44 - 428.34] language model which can read anything

[426.08 - 429.59999999999997] and then the stuff that you want it to

[428.34 - 432.06] read so that's what we're working on

[429.6 - 433.97900000000004] here okay so now that you're caught up I

[432.06 - 436.74] wanted to show this is this is one of

[433.979 - 438.9] the greatest flaws of chat GPT it's not

[436.74 - 441.84000000000003] connected to anything it's in a vacuum

[438.9 - 444.539] Okay cool so now what well we've got our

[441.84 - 446.58] data here it's in text but it's not

[444.539 - 448.8] necessarily machine readable so the

[446.58 - 452.81899999999996] first thing we got to do is we've got to

[448.8 - 455.22] go over here we've got to take our um

[452.819 - 456.53900000000004] take our PDF and then we'll use this

[455.22 - 458.52000000000004] script that I wrote here let me just

[456.539 - 461.099] show it to you real quick

[458.52 - 463.5] um uh so it just takes everything in the

[461.099 - 467.4] folder PDFs and then converts it so let

[463.5 - 469.38] me go ahead and just run this

[467.4 - 472.31899999999996] it should go pretty quick and then we'll

[469.38 - 474.419] look at converted so here it is Tada

[472.319 - 477.06] there we go so you've got and this this

[474.419 - 479.34] repo is public by the way so you've got

[477.06 - 480.84] this oh and one thing that I did was I

[479.34 - 484.25899999999996] added a little thing so that it keeps

[480.84 - 485.88] the new pages I actually might remove

[484.259 - 487.38] that

[485.88 - 489.06] um

[487.38 - 492.479] actually no let's let's keep that

[489.06 - 494.28000000000003] because it it's a helpful demarcation so

[492.479 - 495.78] I added this little token because when

[494.28 - 498.05999999999995] you read a PDF you have to read it Page

[495.78 - 499.79999999999995] by Page and sometimes sometimes knowing

[498.06 - 501.18] where there's a page break

[499.8 - 503.759] um is helpful so we'll keep that that's

[501.18 - 506.34000000000003] fine all right so let's come back to

[503.759 - 508.5] converted we'll copy this and bring it

[506.34 - 509.099] back over to

[508.5 - 511.199] um

[509.099 - 512.58] do opinions

[511.199 - 515.58] Dot

[512.58 - 516.899] underscore text and we'll paste it there

[515.58 - 517.86] all right so I'm going to download a

[516.899 - 518.88] bunch of these I'm going to pause the

[517.86 - 520.26] video you don't need to watch me

[518.88 - 522.479] downloading it but this is what I'm

[520.26 - 523.5] going to do so I'm gonna get like I'm

[522.479 - 525.72] not going to spend the time to download

[523.5 - 527.399] all 300 I'll sort them by like most

[525.72 - 529.14] popular whatever and we'll have a whole

[527.399 - 531.48] bunch of Supreme Court case law about

[529.14 - 533.88] what was this Anti-Trust yeah so we'll

[531.48 - 536.76] be right back

[533.88 - 539.88] Okay I uh downloaded files until I got

[536.76 - 542.22] rate limited so be kind to your data

[539.88 - 544.38] sources and don't abuse them

[542.22 - 546.899] um many websites will do this if they

[544.38 - 547.8] detect that you are uh scraping or

[546.899 - 549.18] whatever

[547.8 - 552.18] um if they don't offer a bulk download

[549.18 - 553.9799999999999] there's there's probably a reason for it

[552.18 - 555.779] um but anyways it didn't give me a

[553.98 - 558.3000000000001] warning that I had violated any any

[555.779 - 560.04] terms of service that just said we see

[558.3 - 561.4799999999999] that you're you're you know we're rate

[560.04 - 563.04] limiting you

[561.48 - 565.2] um it didn't say that there was any

[563.04 - 568.0799999999999] consequences just were temporarily rate

[565.2 - 569.1] limiting you so that's fine

[568.08 - 570.6] um

[569.1 - 572.0400000000001] I mean this is all public information

[570.6 - 574.019] anyways it's from the Library of

[572.04 - 575.6999999999999] Congress so I think it's more of a

[574.019 - 577.8] technical thing so anyways what I'm

[575.7 - 579.6600000000001] doing here is I'm converting it all to

[577.8 - 583.5] text

[579.66 - 586.14] um so let's go to converted excuse me

[583.5 - 588.06] delete the ones that we don't need

[586.14 - 591.24] and this is uh you know this is

[588.06 - 592.68] infinitely more case law than I ever

[591.24 - 595.44] want to read I mean I'm not going to

[592.68 - 598.2199999999999] read one of them let alone 22 of them so

[595.44 - 601.5] let's go ahead and copy these over

[598.22 - 603.12] to my repo here

[601.5 - 605.36] I'm gonna go ahead and replace that one

[603.12 - 609.899] okay so now we have

[605.36 - 612.12] 1.7 megabytes of case law of Anti-Trust

[609.899 - 615.0] case law this goes back to the late 80s

[612.12 - 618.12] so this should be if we understand this

[615.0 - 621.66] if we do a model as if we if we do

[618.12 - 623.279] something that understands this and we

[621.66 - 625.98] should have the ability to interact with

[623.279 - 629.88] a machine that can explain the current

[625.98 - 631.5] common law of antitrust for America hey

[629.88 - 633.779] who knows maybe legal eagle will watch

[631.5 - 635.88] this and uh want to do a collaboration

[633.779 - 637.32] or comment on how accurate it is that

[635.88 - 639.3] would be cool

[637.32 - 641.82] um someone what's his name Devin someone

[639.3 - 645.18] please watch this and uh and get Devin

[641.82 - 647.0400000000001] to check it out and comment on one my

[645.18 - 648.899] accuracy but also the value of this tool

[647.04 - 652.4399999999999] okay

[648.899 - 654.48] so what do we do next well there's so

[652.44 - 658.32] here's the thing the token the biggest

[654.48 - 660.6] limitation is the token limit of large

[658.32 - 663.0600000000001] language models so it's this weird

[660.6 - 664.019] Paradox right where the model itself I

[663.06 - 665.88] don't remember how big they are they're

[664.019 - 669.3] many gigabytes right

[665.88 - 671.279] um I think gpt3 is like 700 gigabytes of

[669.3 - 674.88] vram is how much it takes it's enormous

[671.279 - 676.98] right so but despite how big it is that

[674.88 - 678.36] isn't it can't it can't take in that

[676.98 - 680.399] much information

[678.36 - 682.38] um it takes it's like it's like blowing

[680.399 - 683.88] information in through a straw right

[682.38 - 685.86] same thing with your brain right like

[683.88 - 688.92] your brain has you know it's three

[685.86 - 691.5600000000001] pounds of neurons 100 billion neurons 7

[688.92 - 694.26] 000 synaptic connections per neuron

[691.56 - 696.2399999999999] um but you can only speak at a few bytes

[694.26 - 698.88] per second right the your input and

[696.24 - 701.279] output rate is very slow compared to the

[698.88 - 702.959] processing power of your brain

[701.279 - 706.079] um and and the amount of information in

[702.959 - 707.579] it right so the the the the UI the API

[706.079 - 712.14] is very slow

[707.579 - 714.5999999999999] same thing is true of of deep of of gpt3

[712.14 - 716.64] and all language models right now

[714.6 - 718.44] um so not only that they have a very

[716.64 - 723.18] short memory they can only remember what

[718.44 - 726.0] you do one task at a time so you can it

[723.18 - 728.64] can't it cannot it is not possible for

[726.0 - 731.04] the machine to be able to tell us all

[728.64 - 734.459] about this because even chat gp3 you

[731.04 - 737.2199999999999] know which is a GPT 3.5 the most recent

[734.459 - 739.68] thing still limited and even if you go

[737.22 - 741.6] up by a factor of a hundred there's

[739.68 - 743.579] still too much information here for the

[741.6 - 744.72] model to learn so this is a problem that

[743.579 - 746.64] we're going to have to be contending

[744.72 - 748.019] with for the foreseeable future until

[746.64 - 750.8389999999999] there's some fundamentally different

[748.019 - 753.36] kind of AI model that can read all of

[750.839 - 755.1] this or until it's easier to to fine

[753.36 - 757.14] tune something because honestly the

[755.1 - 759.72] easiest thing would be include all of

[757.14 - 761.579] this data in the Baseline model in the

[759.72 - 763.9200000000001] in the foundation model and then it

[761.579 - 765.4799999999999] knows it just intrinsically but until we

[763.92 - 767.3389999999999] get to that point

[765.48 - 769.86] um because they are really expensive to

[767.339 - 771.6] reach train so until we get to that

[769.86 - 773.899] point we're gonna have to figure out

[771.6 - 777.0] ways of using external

[773.899 - 779.459] databases or knowledge bases so that's

[777.0 - 781.38] the problem statement we've got 1.7

[779.459 - 782.279] megabytes of text here what do we do

[781.38 - 784.56] with it

[782.279 - 786.779] well

[784.56 - 790.38] this is really dry stuff

[786.779 - 793.4399999999999] super dry so what can we do with it

[790.38 - 795.06] um well one thing that we can do is uh

[793.44 - 796.94] I've got this really handy dandy thing

[795.06 - 800.2199999999999] where I've got it

[796.94 - 801.1800000000001] broken up by page right and you see that

[800.22 - 804.36] like

[801.18 - 808.62] um in many cases the the sentence you

[804.36 - 809.339] know will continue so the page the page

[808.62 - 812.399] um

[809.339 - 814.74] a a barrier is not necessarily a good

[812.399 - 816.66] semantic barrier and so what we mean by

[814.74 - 818.88] a semantic barrier or a logical barrier

[816.66 - 821.519] is you might still cut something off

[818.88 - 823.92] right in the middle of of an idea or a

[821.519 - 826.38] thought but it is still a good enough

[823.92 - 828.54] thing to break because when you look at

[826.38 - 830.579] how long this is this is 20 000

[828.54 - 833.76] characters long so this is probably

[830.579 - 837.2399999999999] about two windows worth so we can we can

[833.76 - 838.56] we can have gpt3 read most of this

[837.24 - 840.0] um actually here let me pause it for a

[838.56 - 842.279] second and let's do a quick experiment

[840.0 - 843.779] instead of just tell sorry I was just

[842.279 - 846.18] saying instead of uh telling you I'll

[843.779 - 849.779] show you okay so we put this in here

[846.18 - 851.399] it's 5 800 tokens long our maximum is

[849.779 - 853.62] four thousand

[851.399 - 856.86] um so if we just split something like

[853.62 - 859.139] this in half right so it's twenty

[856.86 - 861.9590000000001] thousand uh characters so we split it in

[859.139 - 863.94] half we summarize it that way we may be

[861.959 - 866.04] able to do something with it

[863.94 - 869.0400000000001] um but the question is or the problem

[866.04 - 871.74] then is we don't know exactly what we

[869.04 - 874.019] want out of it right so let's think

[871.74 - 876.0] about this what kind of information if

[874.019 - 877.68] we wanted to make like a Wikipedia right

[876.0 - 878.519] maybe that's maybe that's a good way to

[877.68 - 881.0999999999999] go

[878.519 - 884.639] um is is what are what are the

[881.1 - 886.62] implications here so in this case

[884.639 - 888.3] um you know boxing matches sued Don King

[886.62 - 889.199] oh this is fun

[888.3 - 892.3199999999999] um

[889.199 - 894.18] uh for Rico charges okay and they refer

[892.32 - 896.1600000000001] to other codes

[894.18 - 899.459] um and so basically it what this is

[896.16 - 902.519] doing is it's using language to build

[899.459 - 904.92] um a web of like reasoning and logic so

[902.519 - 906.839] this actually sounds kind of like a

[904.92 - 908.2199999999999] Knowledge Graph so I'm wondering what if

[906.839 - 909.48] we what if we use this to build a

[908.22 - 911.339] knowledge rest I've never built a

[909.48 - 913.5] Knowledge Graph this is fun

[911.339 - 915.0600000000001] um so maybe maybe what what the the goal

[913.5 - 917.459] here is is let's build a Knowledge Graph

[915.06 - 919.8599999999999] okay so let's go back over to chat GPT

[917.459 - 922.8599999999999] in just a second and ask it what a

[919.86 - 924.779] knowledge graph is and how to build one

[922.86 - 928.5] okay I was able to get right logged into

[924.779 - 930.48] GPT or chat GPT sorry what is a

[928.5 - 931.92] knowledge graph

[930.48 - 933.36] let's see what it says a knowledge graph

[931.92 - 934.86] is a data model that represents a

[933.36 - 936.72] collection of interconnected data and

[934.86 - 939.36] Concepts typically organized around

[936.72 - 941.0400000000001] entities and their relationships it is

[939.36 - 943.32] used to represent and organize large

[941.04 - 944.639] volumes of structured and unstructured

[943.32 - 946.4590000000001] data in a way that allows for easy

[944.639 - 949.199] querying and visualization of

[946.459 - 951.2399999999999] relationships okay and then it looks

[949.199 - 952.74] like it froze including search engines

[951.24 - 955.0790000000001] recommendation systems and natural

[952.74 - 957.12] language

[955.079 - 960.4799999999999] it's gonna freeze up

[957.12 - 962.16] um so anyways uh yeah so then once this

[960.48 - 965.279] is unfrozen the next question I'll ask

[962.16 - 966.54] is um or can I hit Escape you cannot

[965.279 - 969.06] abort

[966.54 - 972.0] um so the next question is uh that I'll

[969.06 - 974.3389999999999] ask is what kind of format is it

[972.0 - 976.32] um or I'll pause it until it unfreezes

[974.339 - 978.5400000000001] or I will pause the video Until It

[976.32 - 980.399] unfreeze I don't know if I said unpause

[978.54 - 981.7199999999999] okay I think it was just frozen so

[980.399 - 982.92] because I refresh the screen and it's

[981.72 - 984.899] fine

[982.92 - 987.18] um okay so I'm saying how can I code a

[984.899 - 988.56] knowledge graph says manually build a

[987.18 - 990.7199999999999] Knowledge Graph if you have a small

[988.56 - 993.4799999999999] amount of data to do so you can build it

[990.72 - 995.279] by creating nodes in the entities you

[993.48 - 997.8000000000001] can also use a tool like graphis or

[995.279 - 1000.86] gephy to visualize and edit your

[997.8 - 1002.8389999999999] knowledge graph interesting okay

[1000.86 - 1005.259] use an NLP tool that's exactly what I'm

[1002.839 - 1008.6] going to do a graph database okay

[1005.259 - 1011.839] use natural uh to use a pre-existing

[1008.6 - 1013.519] Knowledge Graph cool so I wonder what

[1011.839 - 1015.5600000000001] kind of format these guys take I wonder

[1013.519 - 1020.0600000000001] if it knows

[1015.56 - 1021.3199999999999] so neo4j or Amazon Neptune cool

[1020.06 - 1025.3999999999999] um

[1021.32 - 1026.0] let's see what uh file format

[1025.4 - 1029.419] um

[1026.0 - 1034.66] is a knowledge graph

[1029.419 - 1034.66] um like can I use Json or something

[1035.9 - 1038.6000000000001] let's see there are a number of

[1037.16 - 1041.059] different file formats you can use to

[1038.6 - 1043.3999999999999] represent a Knowledge Graph some common

[1041.059 - 1048.22] ones are graphml and XML based file

[1043.4 - 1050.7800000000002] format okay graph is guessing y Ed okay

[1048.22 - 1052.4] rdf the resource description I don't

[1050.78 - 1055.34] know anything about knowledge graphs

[1052.4 - 1057.0800000000002] other than the theory Json LD is a

[1055.34 - 1060.32] lightweight linked data format that can

[1057.08 - 1062.48] be used to do that CSV really

[1060.32 - 1065.1789999999999] CSV is simple

[1062.48 - 1067.7] on one row per relationship with columns

[1065.179 - 1070.3600000000001] for the source and Target nodes

[1067.7 - 1070.3600000000001] okay

[1070.88 - 1075.0800000000002] um I am personally a big fan of Json

[1073.1 - 1077.48] because it's human readable

[1075.08 - 1079.46] CSV is human readable but it's a little

[1077.48 - 1082.7] bit on the Messier side especially when

[1079.46 - 1088.82] you get really complicated so uh can you

[1082.7 - 1092.059] give me an example of a Json lb

[1088.82 - 1094.039] Knowledge Graph

[1092.059 - 1097.8799999999999] um let's say uh

[1094.039 - 1101.96] for instance I want to see

[1097.88 - 1103.7600000000002] um some nodes about the history of uh

[1101.96 - 1105.6200000000001] France

[1103.76 - 1108.76] I'm kind of a Francophile I've visited

[1105.62 - 1108.76] France and I really love it there

[1108.799 - 1115.6] okay sure here's an example of Json LD

[1113.179 - 1115.6000000000001] um all right

[1116.9 - 1122.9] so it looks like each node is actually

[1119.84 - 1124.76] pretty simple where it's got an ID a

[1122.9 - 1127.22] type a name and a description that's

[1124.76 - 1128.72] actually really simple

[1127.22 - 1131.539] um nationality

[1128.72 - 1134.419] oh interesting it looks like the some of

[1131.539 - 1137.44] the things are kind of arbitrary

[1134.419 - 1137.44] French Revolution

[1138.32 - 1141.1] start date

[1143.6 - 1146.9189999999999] Napoleon Bonaparte

[1148.64 - 1152.9] but yeah I really I really like it uh

[1150.62 - 1154.1599999999999] France won the culture so when I visited

[1152.9 - 1156.14] while this is running I'll tell you a

[1154.16 - 1158.1200000000001] little bit about France uh when I

[1156.14 - 1160.22] visited

[1158.12 - 1164.299] yeah okay sure

[1160.22 - 1167.9] um so when I when I I visited France uh

[1164.299 - 1169.58] 10 years ago in 2012 and what I really

[1167.9 - 1170.24] like okay here we go

[1169.58 - 1174.74] um

[1170.24 - 1176.78] let's see how uh does Json

[1174.74 - 1178.4] LD establish

[1176.78 - 1182.4189999999999] relationships

[1178.4 - 1186.5590000000002] I don't see any examples of

[1182.419 - 1189.44] um Connections in the above example

[1186.559 - 1190.16] okay so while it's telling me

[1189.44 - 1192.26] um

[1190.16 - 1194.66] the at ID

[1192.26 - 1197.419] oh okay so all right it'll it'll explain

[1194.66 - 1200.9] anyways so the culture in France is

[1197.419 - 1202.5200000000002] somewhat similar to America in um in

[1200.9 - 1203.9] that uh we both think very highly of

[1202.52 - 1205.7] ourselves

[1203.9 - 1208.64] um but there are some really Stark

[1205.7 - 1210.26] differences and namely the pace of life

[1208.64 - 1213.6200000000001] in France

[1210.26 - 1215.179] um where you know sure if you go to the

[1213.62 - 1216.1399999999999] big cities like Paris it's rush rush

[1215.179 - 1218.299] rush

[1216.14 - 1220.94] um but if you get outside of Paris even

[1218.299 - 1223.76] in some of the larger cities people just

[1220.94 - 1225.3200000000002] have a different attitude towards life

[1223.76 - 1228.02] um you know they're the the the the

[1225.32 - 1229.7] portion meal portion sizes are smaller

[1228.02 - 1232.28] and

[1229.7 - 1235.22] um other other things like that but then

[1232.28 - 1237.44] it's like people are less in a hurry

[1235.22 - 1238.82] um and then um I hear that Italy is even

[1237.44 - 1240.8600000000001] worse where it's just like nothing

[1238.82 - 1242.96] happens quickly in Italy so maybe it's

[1240.86 - 1245.24] just a European thing anyways

[1242.96 - 1247.22] um it's very refreshing to see a modern

[1245.24 - 1249.98] powerful Nation because France is the

[1247.22 - 1252.6200000000001] number three exporter of like military

[1249.98 - 1254.84] hardware or something I don't remember

[1252.62 - 1257.4189999999999] but like this is a powerful modern

[1254.84 - 1258.799] country that has a much slower pace of

[1257.419 - 1260.96] life and a different attitude towards

[1258.799 - 1263.24] enjoying things okay let's see what it

[1260.96 - 1265.16] says about how these things link it says

[1263.24 - 1268.039] okay and the example I provide did I use

[1265.16 - 1272.48] ID property for example in the following

[1268.039 - 1275.66] snippet so it does that the nationality

[1272.48 - 1279.919] property is set to ID

[1275.66 - 1282.559] of France oh okay okay so the net this

[1279.919 - 1284.2990000000002] this is the connection

[1282.559 - 1286.8799999999999] so if you're if you're referring to

[1284.299 - 1289.4] another thing

[1286.88 - 1291.74] got it so nationality is like a property

[1289.4 - 1294.38] so the the properties that are attached

[1291.74 - 1296.24] to each node are arbitrary and then you

[1294.38 - 1301.24] can also just have one connect back to

[1296.24 - 1301.24] another got it got it okay cool

[1301.76 - 1308.179] I wonder if we can just have gpt3

[1304.72 - 1312.14] rewrite this as a knowledge as a Json LD

[1308.179 - 1315.98] Knowledge Graph if chat if chat GPT

[1312.14 - 1321.0200000000002] um knows this knows it this well

[1315.98 - 1323.78] um and and text DaVinci 03 is also the

[1321.02 - 1326.4189999999999] same underlying model GPT 3.5 it's

[1323.78 - 1327.08] entirely possible this will work

[1326.419 - 1330.3200000000002] um

[1327.08 - 1332.6] okay uh let's see convert

[1330.32 - 1337.7] the following

[1332.6 - 1340.58] um scotus opinion document into a Json

[1337.7 - 1344.059] LD formatted

[1340.58 - 1345.799] um Knowledge Graph

[1344.059 - 1348.2] and then we'll add some vertical white

[1345.799 - 1351.1399999999999] space just to be friendly to the thing

[1348.2 - 1353.059] and we'll come down to let's see it's

[1351.14 - 1355.3400000000001] just a little bit too long let's cut

[1353.059 - 1356.36] this roughly in half

[1355.34 - 1360.02] so

[1356.36 - 1364.2199999999998] start let's see new page so in addition

[1360.02 - 1367.179] Ace acts so blah blah okay

[1364.22 - 1367.179] so let's

[1367.22 - 1371.059] oops come back

[1369.32 - 1372.62] just save that there

[1371.059 - 1374.78] and then we'll give it some more

[1372.62 - 1376.2199999999998] vertical white space

[1374.78 - 1376.82] um and then we'll do

[1376.22 - 1381.38] um

[1376.82 - 1382.8799999999999] uh Json LD uh

[1381.38 - 1385.7] Knowledge Graph

[1382.88 - 1387.5] okay cool also one thing that I have

[1385.7 - 1391.039] discovered is I actually prefer to turn

[1387.5 - 1394.94] the temperature down lately and the

[1391.039 - 1397.28] reason is because I found that um you're

[1394.94 - 1400.159] especially the the most recent ones the

[1397.28 - 1402.3799999999999] instruct aligned ones

[1400.159 - 1404.5390000000002] um they do almost exactly what you want

[1402.38 - 1407.0] and so with a temperature of zero you

[1404.539 - 1408.3799999999999] get really good consistent results

[1407.0 - 1410.36] um so I have changed my default

[1408.38 - 1412.2800000000002] temperature to zero

[1410.36 - 1415.1] um you know and everything else just

[1412.28 - 1419.44] zero zero zero it's it's pretty well

[1415.1 - 1419.4399999999998] aligned okay so let's see if this works

[1432.14 - 1436.179] um it looks like it's going to do like

[1433.46 - 1436.179] the whole thing

[1442.82 - 1447.08] vehicle true vehicle vehicle okay

[1445.7 - 1449.48] so that's

[1447.08 - 1452.059] not quite what I had in mind what I was

[1449.48 - 1455.1200000000001] hoping is that it would break down the

[1452.059 - 1458.299] um the other the what I want is the

[1455.12 - 1460.1] opinions and the um and what do you call

[1458.299 - 1464.24] these like where you where you reference

[1460.1 - 1465.62] something right so

[1464.24 - 1468.919] um let's give it a little bit more

[1465.62 - 1470.78] instructions about what I want um

[1468.919 - 1473.8600000000001] specifically

[1470.78 - 1473.86] uh um

[1474.679 - 1480.64] uh let's see

[1477.02 - 1484.28] let's see yeah uh focus on dates

[1480.64 - 1486.8600000000001] decisions opinions

[1484.28 - 1489.76] um and reasoning

[1486.86 - 1489.76] uh

[1490.1 - 1498.3799999999999] the purpose of this knowledge graph is

[1494.24 - 1502.94] to be searchable uh by lawyers

[1498.38 - 1505.88] for um legal precedent

[1502.94 - 1507.14] and case law

[1505.88 - 1509.419] um

[1507.14 - 1512.2990000000002] and let's say let's say specifically by

[1509.419 - 1514.039] trial lawyers so this is basically I'm

[1512.299 - 1516.44] telling it this is a research tool here

[1514.039 - 1519.74] I'll just tell it this is a research

[1516.44 - 1520.5800000000002] tool for preparing for

[1519.74 - 1524.059] um

[1520.58 - 1525.799] trials before The Supreme Court

[1524.059 - 1528.3799999999999] I'm just trying like what would Devin

[1525.799 - 1529.94] say on legal eagle

[1528.38 - 1533.2990000000002] um okay

[1529.94 - 1536.6000000000001] so let's try this again and see if this

[1533.299 - 1537.799] changes a little bit about how it

[1536.6 - 1540.1999999999998] composes

[1537.799 - 1544.059] um this this thing

[1540.2 - 1544.059] decision opinion reasoning excellent

[1548.24 - 1552.08] opinion and the circumstances requires

[1550.58 - 1554.98] no more formal legal distinction between

[1552.08 - 1554.98] person and Enterprise

[1555.14 - 1559.76] um

[1555.919 - 1562.4] okay that's interesting

[1559.76 - 1564.98] um it's still not quite

[1562.4 - 1566.72] I'm still missing something what is it

[1564.98 - 1569.0] that I want from this maybe maybe we

[1566.72 - 1571.22] can't go straight to

[1569.0 - 1573.02] um to this hang on I think someone's

[1571.22 - 1574.94] moving around let me uh close my door

[1573.02 - 1578.0] I'll be right back in a second okay

[1574.94 - 1579.919] sorry about that so it's it's breaking

[1578.0 - 1581.72] it down into one thing but what up like

[1579.919 - 1583.46] I guess I need to think what nodes do I

[1581.72 - 1587.1200000000001] want out of this

[1583.46 - 1588.679] um and then you know so each node will

[1587.12 - 1590.799] be

[1588.679 - 1590.799] um

[1595.279 - 1597.86] well here let me let me go ahead and

[1596.6 - 1600.1] save this prompt because it's pretty

[1597.86 - 1600.1] good

[1600.38 - 1605.659] um so first I think first thing we need

[1602.36 - 1607.3999999999999] to do is get the whole thing Rewritten

[1605.659 - 1610.7] in such a way

[1607.4 - 1612.44] that it is um that it can fit inside a

[1610.7 - 1615.2] single prompt window because if we have

[1612.44 - 1616.039] the whole the whole thing

[1615.2 - 1619.22] um

[1616.039 - 1622.279] a little bit more con condensed excuse

[1619.22 - 1624.14] me then we should be able to get a

[1622.279 - 1626.72] proper thing but we also need to think

[1624.14 - 1629.419] about what kind of nodes do we want

[1626.72 - 1632.539] um so you know which aspect you know the

[1629.419 - 1634.94] second the second circuit did this uh

[1632.539 - 1638.36] Rico requires this

[1634.94 - 1640.3400000000001] um and this other case it said that

[1638.36 - 1642.3799999999999] um so I guess each node is going to be

[1640.34 - 1645.559] every case cited

[1642.38 - 1647.8400000000001] yeah okay so the case cited and why I

[1645.559 - 1648.62] think that's each node all right cool so

[1647.84 - 1650.24] let's

[1648.62 - 1652.76] um

[1650.24 - 1653.72] Let's uh let's see

[1652.76 - 1657.26] um

[1653.72 - 1659.32] each node should be

[1657.26 - 1659.32] um

[1660.02 - 1663.3799999999999] yeah each node should be

[1662.24 - 1665.36] um a case

[1663.38 - 1668.3200000000002] uh

[1665.36 - 1668.32] case citation

[1668.36 - 1670.6999999999998] um

[1669.2 - 1673.4] precedent

[1670.7 - 1675.74] or prior opinion I'm probably using the

[1673.4 - 1677.679] wrong term but

[1675.74 - 1681.919] um

[1677.679 - 1686.799] include uh what the heck was the the um

[1681.919 - 1686.7990000000002] the parameter um my goodness

[1687.02 - 1691.4] the uh what's the term why is my brain

[1689.24 - 1693.52] doing this I need more coffee

[1691.4 - 1693.52] um

[1693.74 - 1698.779] unique identifier property prop not

[1696.799 - 1700.58] parameter property

[1698.779 - 1703.72] um

[1700.58 - 1705.86] each node should have several properties

[1703.72 - 1707.84] such as

[1705.86 - 1710.24] um date

[1707.84 - 1712.76] uh let's see

[1710.24 - 1713.48] case number

[1712.76 - 1716.24] um

[1713.48 - 1717.799] involved parties

[1716.24 - 1723.08] um

[1717.799 - 1725.2] reasoning for including in this opinion

[1723.08 - 1725.1999999999998] um

[1725.5 - 1729.5] and other relevant

[1728.72 - 1732.88] um

[1729.5 - 1732.88] information okay

[1732.98 - 1737.779] so let's let's see if if we can get the

[1736.1 - 1740.24] nodes that we want because if we can go

[1737.779 - 1742.4] ahead and convert each each thing to to

[1740.24 - 1743.779] nodes that might save us a step but I

[1742.4 - 1745.22] suspect we're going to have to summarize

[1743.779 - 1748.6] it first

[1745.22 - 1748.6000000000001] this is really cool

[1750.32 - 1756.58] I was really skeptical about chat GPT

[1752.659 - 1756.5800000000002] but um I'm becoming less skeptical

[1760.159 - 1767.38] oh this is good yes it's working it's

[1764.0 - 1767.38] working it's working

[1770.6 - 1775.2199999999998] okay so let's save this prompt because

[1773.059 - 1777.559] this worked really well

[1775.22 - 1781.3990000000001] um all right so I'll save this as um

[1777.559 - 1785.48] let's go up here and we'll say prompt

[1781.399 - 1789.1399999999999] um let's see uh Json LD

[1785.48 - 1792.5] um and then we'll do citation nodes

[1789.14 - 1796.22] um so this is an example

[1792.5 - 1799.76] we'll say example prompt okay so we got

[1796.22 - 1800.8990000000001] we got the nodes that we want I believe

[1799.76 - 1802.52] um

[1800.899 - 1804.1399999999999] oh man this is going to be fun because

[1802.52 - 1806.36] then I can try and figure out how to

[1804.14 - 1807.679] take all this and and visualize it

[1806.36 - 1809.0] I wonder if we can visualize it with

[1807.679 - 1810.6200000000001] python

[1809.0 - 1813.14] um all right but let's let's go let's

[1810.62 - 1815.059] let's pause for a second because this is

[1813.14 - 1817.159] only half the document that's not good

[1815.059 - 1819.9189999999999] enough right do we want it do we want to

[1817.159 - 1822.8600000000001] just read it raw and just go straight to

[1819.919 - 1825.14] it let's try summarizing it

[1822.86 - 1827.6589999999999] um and and let's see if we can get the

[1825.14 - 1829.3400000000001] whole opinion in one document now here's

[1827.659 - 1831.679] the thing some of these opinions are

[1829.34 - 1833.9599999999998] like 200 pages long so how are we going

[1831.679 - 1835.46] to do that right because in order for

[1833.96 - 1837.44] the thing to make sense you kind of do

[1835.46 - 1840.32] need to have the whole thing but you

[1837.44 - 1842.779] also don't want to lose detail right so

[1840.32 - 1844.6399999999999] let's think about this for a second

[1842.779 - 1849.559] um

[1844.64 - 1852.44] let's see uh let's see rewrite the

[1849.559 - 1854.299] following scotus up

[1852.44 - 1854.96] opinion

[1854.299 - 1857.779] um

[1854.96 - 1860.059] let's see as a let's say as a list of

[1857.779 - 1862.24] assertions

[1860.059 - 1862.24] um

[1864.32 - 1871.399] no we'll say we'll say summarize because

[1866.72 - 1873.6200000000001] that summarize uh implies that you want

[1871.399 - 1874.279] um to reduce word count

[1873.62 - 1875.799] um

[1874.279 - 1879.26] remove

[1875.799 - 1881.32] Superfluous language

[1879.26 - 1881.32] um

[1881.659 - 1887.8400000000001] while retaining

[1884.0 - 1887.84] specific details

[1888.679 - 1892.7] um

[1889.82 - 1895.1789999999999] yeah let's see let's see if that works

[1892.7 - 1895.179] summary

[1900.919 - 1906.5590000000002] okay yeah this those are good those are

[1904.82 - 1908.899] good notes but it's not retaining the

[1906.559 - 1911.6589999999999] information that I want to see such as

[1908.899 - 1913.76] the nodes okay so rather than read it

[1911.659 - 1916.88] multiple times I think what we'll do is

[1913.76 - 1918.919] we'll break it into chunks of

[1916.88 - 1922.64] um let's see how long is this

[1918.919 - 1924.0200000000002] we'll do chunks of 13

[1922.64 - 1925.64] 000

[1924.02 - 1928.279] um that seems that seems good so we'll

[1925.64 - 1931.7] do chunks of Thirteen thousand and um

[1928.279 - 1933.559] and just go straight to graphs to

[1931.7 - 1935.179] knowledge graphs because that worked

[1933.559 - 1938.0] really well that worked exceptionally

[1935.179 - 1940.48] well okay so let's go ahead and clean

[1938.0 - 1940.48] this up

[1940.82 - 1945.9189999999999] and we'll come down here and do

[1944.0 - 1949.94] chunk

[1945.919 - 1952.22] and then Jason Alda Json LD Knowledge

[1949.94 - 1952.8200000000002] Graph

[1952.22 - 1955.88] um

[1952.82 - 1959.299] and then we'll do f file save as

[1955.88 - 1961.159] prompt Json LD

[1959.299 - 1963.86] um citation nodes

[1961.159 - 1965.1200000000001] and I need to take a quick bio break

[1963.86 - 1966.799] I'll be right back I'm sure you wanted

[1965.12 - 1968.899] to know that

[1966.799 - 1970.6399999999999] all right actually I just realized this

[1968.899 - 1973.1] video is running long

[1970.64 - 1975.679] um it's already 30 minutes and uh and

[1973.1 - 1977.7199999999998] I'm a bit fried so we'll come back we've

[1975.679 - 1980.1200000000001] got our feet we've got our bearings and

[1977.72 - 1982.34] so when we come back for the next video

[1980.12 - 1984.32] we will start doing the data prep

[1982.34 - 1985.4599999999998] because that's that's a lot of fun let

[1984.32 - 1986.84] me tell you that's why I don't want to

[1985.46 - 1988.22] do it right now

[1986.84 - 1990.4399999999998] um so we'll take

[1988.22 - 1993.019] all of these opinions we will split them

[1990.44 - 1995.179] into chunks while keeping some of the

[1993.019 - 1996.799] essential information with each chunk

[1995.179 - 1998.6000000000001] and got to do a little bit of figuring

[1996.799 - 2001.44] about how to how do we format the

[1998.6 - 2003.82] knowledge graph correctly because each

[2001.44 - 2006.3400000000001] yeah there's there's some problems to

[2003.82 - 2008.1399999999999] solve so but we'll split it into chunks

[2006.34 - 2010.4189999999999] we'll prepare the data we'll do some

[2008.14 - 2012.22] experiments with generating a Knowledge

[2010.419 - 2013.72] Graph and then

[2012.22 - 2015.279] um that's probably all that part two

[2013.72 - 2017.8600000000001] will have and then part three will be

[2015.279 - 2019.84] actually like let's load this into a

[2017.86 - 2021.58] database or visualizer

[2019.84 - 2025.74] um all right gang thanks for watching

[2021.58 - 2025.74] it's good to be back and take care
