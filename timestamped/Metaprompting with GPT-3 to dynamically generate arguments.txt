[0.56 - 5.040000000000001] happy monday morning everybody um david

[2.72 - 6.960000000000001] shapiro here with another video

[5.04 - 9.36] uh let me go ahead and introduce today's

[6.96 - 12.559000000000001] topic um so

[9.36 - 14.559] i posted on the open ai forum um just

[12.559 - 16.72] say hey bring me your research and

[14.559 - 18.0] business problems and i'll see what i

[16.72 - 21.358999999999998] can do

[18.0 - 23.039] and so anna r mills is an expert in

[21.359 - 26.64] constructing arguments and asked me to

[23.039 - 28.32] take a look at doing this with gpt3

[26.64 - 30.0] so i'll show you the data in a second

[28.32 - 32.079] but the most important thing is the

[30.0 - 33.76] instructions that she gives her i guess

[32.079 - 36.079] students um

[33.76 - 38.239] and it's it's basically teaching them

[36.079 - 40.32] how to how to construct um

[38.239 - 42.16] critical arguments against something

[40.32 - 44.079] so write a thorough summary and critical

[42.16 - 45.599999999999994] assessment of the argument the summary

[44.079 - 47.52] should describe the key ideas of the

[45.6 - 49.039] argument including the main claim

[47.52 - 51.199000000000005] uh key reasons counter arguments

[49.039 - 52.559000000000005] rebuttals and limits

[51.199 - 54.48] the assessment should discuss the

[52.559 - 56.32] strengths and weaknesses of the argument

[54.48 - 58.879] what was compelling persuasive troubling

[56.32 - 61.28] unclear or problematic choose phrases

[58.879 - 62.96] like elegant argues throughout to show

[61.28 - 64.32000000000001] that the writer's purpose

[62.96 - 65.43900000000001] to show the writer's purpose at each

[64.32 - 67.119] point

[65.439 - 68.96] write most of the essay in your own

[67.119 - 70.4] words but consider using the occasional

[68.96 - 73.03999999999999] direct quote

[70.4 - 75.04] where original word choice is critical

[73.04 - 76.96000000000001] the introductory paragraph should

[75.04 - 79.119] include the title of the argument the

[76.96 - 80.79899999999999] author's full name the argument's main

[79.119 - 82.479] claim and your overall assessment of the

[80.799 - 83.60000000000001] argument's validity

[82.479 - 84.79899999999999] okay

[83.6 - 87.6] so

[84.799 - 90.159] um this might sound like one task but

[87.6 - 92.72] this is actually many many many tasks

[90.159 - 94.72] and so let me show you some of the data

[92.72 - 97.03999999999999] that um she sent over

[94.72 - 99.439] to show you what i mean and so this is

[97.04 - 101.36000000000001] this is one reason that a lot of people

[99.439 - 103.119] think that like oh gpt 3 is really

[101.36 - 104.479] stupid because you ask it to do like all

[103.119 - 106.799] these things at once and it only does

[104.479 - 108.56] one of the things

[106.799 - 110.07900000000001] and that is because what we need to do

[108.56 - 112.399] is we need to break these things down

[110.079 - 114.32] into separate cognitive tasks

[112.399 - 117.2] so here's the instructions that she

[114.32 - 118.96] gives um and really this is a procedure

[117.2 - 120.24000000000001] right it says do this this this this is

[118.96 - 121.52] how it should look

[120.24 - 123.759] um

[121.52 - 125.52] gpt3 will be able to get some of this

[123.759 - 127.92] but let me show you an example of one of

[125.52 - 129.35999999999999] the inputs so here's one of the here's

[127.92 - 133.52] one of the essays

[129.36 - 136.0] um it is 1500 1600 characters long

[133.52 - 138.8] and then we go get the the critique look

[136.0 - 142.319] how long the critique is the critique is

[138.8 - 144.08] way longer than the um

[142.319 - 147.28] then the then the uh

[144.08 - 149.12] actual essay it's 5800 characters long

[147.28 - 150.72] okay so that's

[149.12 - 153.04] that's a lot of critique

[150.72 - 155.599] um unfortunately this is probably a

[153.04 - 158.79999999999998] little bit too long to fit in in a

[155.599 - 160.39999999999998] single prompt which is another reason um

[158.8 - 163.44] so let's see how many tokens this is oh

[160.4 - 164.959] only 1500 tokens okay never mind um so

[163.44 - 167.44] this could actually fit in original

[164.959 - 169.36] davinci however

[167.44 - 170.879] what we're doing here

[169.36 - 172.4] is

[170.879 - 174.879] is basically i'm going to break it down

[172.4 - 175.68] into prompt chaining

[174.879 - 177.44] so

[175.68 - 180.0] with all that said

[177.44 - 182.0] we are going to i've already got the

[180.0 - 183.36] repo created so let's go ahead and clone

[182.0 - 184.72] this down

[183.36 - 186.959] um

[184.72 - 186.959] and

[187.76 - 190.959] let's get clone

[191.44 - 195.2] yes i fat fingered that there we go

[194.319 - 197.2] okay

[195.2 - 200.56] so then we've got our brand new repo

[197.2 - 201.44] here critical argument yep that looks

[200.56 - 204.319] good

[201.44 - 206.0] and then we'll open another one

[204.319 - 208.319] um

[206.0 - 213.84] increasingly verbose bot

[208.319 - 213.83999999999997] copy my git ignore and open ai key

[214.959 - 219.12] okay

[216.48 - 220.64] and then

[219.12 - 223.76] increasingly verbose just go ahead and

[220.64 - 225.67999999999998] copy a script over i'll rename it

[223.76 - 229.04] paste

[225.68 - 229.04000000000002] okay so this will be um

[229.84 - 234.959] critical argument

[232.4 - 236.31900000000002] um i'll just call it critical argument

[234.959 - 238.08] so what we're going to do within this

[236.319 - 239.28] though is we're going to set up prompt

[238.08 - 242.4] chaining

[239.28 - 243.36] so the first thing we need to do

[242.4 - 245.36] is

[243.36 - 247.36] let's look at the instructions

[245.36 - 249.12] write a thorough summary and critical

[247.36 - 251.59900000000002] assessment of the argument

[249.12 - 253.04] that is the highest order

[251.599 - 254.79899999999998] instruction

[253.04 - 256.4] and then this describes the summary the

[254.799 - 258.88] summary should describe the key ideas

[256.4 - 261.12] including the main main claim blah blah

[258.88 - 261.12] okay

[263.12 - 266.72] so we'll say this is this is subordinate

[265.68 - 267.6] to

[266.72 - 270.24] um

[267.6 - 272.24] the first instruction right

[270.24 - 274.16] let's see the

[272.24 - 277.46000000000004] assessment should discuss the strengths

[274.16 - 278.88000000000005] and weaknesses of the argument

[277.46 - 280.56] [Music]

[278.88 - 282.4] what was compelling persuasive troubling

[280.56 - 284.24] clear and problematic

[282.4 - 288.08] throughout

[284.24 - 288.08] okay so the throughout is

[290.96 - 295.44] global instructions

[293.84 - 299.44] write most of the essay in your own

[295.44 - 299.44] words also global instructions

[304.4 - 308.23999999999995] let's see

[306.4 - 310.56] the introductory paragraph should

[308.24 - 314.08] include the title of the argument main

[310.56 - 314.08] claim in your overall okay

[315.199 - 318.96000000000004] okay so basically what i'm doing here is

[317.039 - 321.759] i kind of chopped up the instructions to

[318.96 - 321.75899999999996] show that it's like

[323.199 - 328.72] uh let's see that it like it's it's

[325.919 - 330.24] separate tasks um i'm i don't i don't

[328.72 - 331.84000000000003] think i'm wording this correctly but i

[330.24 - 333.6] hope that by showing you

[331.84 - 335.59999999999997] um so like there's an order of

[333.6 - 337.44] operations basically the introductory

[335.6 - 339.03900000000004] paragraph right should include this

[337.44 - 342.479] choose phrases like elegant argues

[339.039 - 342.479] throughout to show the writer's purpose

[343.919 - 348.08] actually i wonder if this should be

[345.44 - 348.08] subordinate

[349.68 - 352.96] because this first instruction is kind

[351.68 - 355.44] of

[352.96 - 357.12] the global purpose right that is what

[355.44 - 359.28] this paper is

[357.12 - 362.72] um rightmost the essay in your own words

[359.28 - 362.71999999999997] okay yeah i think that's good

[364.4 - 367.4] um

[371.44 - 374.08] and then

[375.28 - 380.23999999999995] yeah okay so the reason i'm chopping it

[377.52 - 382.31899999999996] up this way is just to show how the mind

[380.24 - 384.16] how your mind might organize this

[382.319 - 386.16] because the instructions that she gives

[384.16 - 387.91900000000004] kind of talk about this part and this

[386.16 - 389.6] part in this part but what what happens

[387.919 - 391.68] in your mind as you build it up is

[389.6 - 394.0] you're kind of constructing an image um

[391.68 - 396.72] so our brains are kind of like um

[394.0 - 398.639] object-oriented coding where um you know

[396.72 - 400.56] it's like okay so you start with this

[398.639 - 403.199] primary idea and then you attach a new

[400.56 - 405.199] feature to it or a new um or a new uh

[403.199 - 407.039] characteristic and then you modify that

[405.199 - 408.88] characteristic and then you add a new

[407.039 - 410.96] you know value or whatever or a new

[408.88 - 412.8] function to it and so you keep operating

[410.96 - 416.0] on this object in your mind which is

[412.8 - 416.0] constructing this argument

[416.479 - 419.84] now

[417.599 - 421.599] before we do that let's just do an

[419.84 - 423.84] experiment because right now i'm

[421.599 - 426.15999999999997] operating off of intuition so it's like

[423.84 - 428.31899999999996] what if i'm wrong right what if what if

[426.16 - 432.08000000000004] gpt3 can handle

[428.319 - 435.03900000000004] can handle this just sight unseen

[432.08 - 436.96] so let's go and test that real quick

[435.039 - 440.31899999999996] so write a thorough summary and critical

[436.96 - 441.35999999999996] assessment um and then

[440.319 - 443.36] argument

[441.36 - 444.88] actually here no we don't even need that

[443.36 - 448.08000000000004] just go grab it

[444.88 - 448.08] essay to critique

[449.039 - 453.44] add some more new lines

[451.12 - 453.44] okay

[455.52 - 461.75899999999996] credit uh let's see we'll say

[458.16 - 461.759] summary and critical

[462.84 - 468.4] assessment now this is da vincio 2 so um

[470.0 - 472.8] okay

[471.12 - 475.12] not bad

[472.8 - 476.08] may contain sensitive content all right

[475.12 - 478.479] so

[476.08 - 479.44] in wouldn't we all cross the border

[478.479 - 481.44] yep

[479.44 - 483.12] um anna mills argues that illegal

[481.44 - 484.71999999999997] immigration is not inherently wrong or

[483.12 - 486.72] unethical mills points out that if most

[484.72 - 487.84000000000003] people were in a situation where their

[486.72 - 489.28000000000003] children were starving and they had a

[487.84 - 491.35999999999996] chance to get to the us they would take

[489.28 - 492.63899999999995] it regardless of the legal consequences

[491.36 - 494.24] therefore mills concludes that we must

[492.639 - 496.40000000000003] find a border policy that treats

[494.24 - 497.84000000000003] migrants with empathy and respect this

[496.4 - 501.28] is a compelling argument that highlights

[497.84 - 502.87899999999996] the human side of illegal immigration

[501.28 - 504.63899999999995] now that's still really hot

[502.879 - 506.16] mills effectively uses hypothetical

[504.639 - 507.44] situations to illustrate her point that

[506.16 - 508.639] most people

[507.44 - 510.71999999999997] would do whatever it takes to get their

[508.639 - 512.479] families to safety however the argument

[510.72 - 514.08] does not address some of the more

[512.479 - 515.9190000000001] practical concerns around illegal

[514.08 - 517.36] immigration such as national security

[515.919 - 518.64] overall this is a thought-provoking

[517.36 - 519.76] piece that challenges readers to

[518.64 - 521.68] consider the issue from a different

[519.76 - 525.04] perspective i would say that is a

[521.68 - 526.7199999999999] phenomenal opening paragraph however

[525.04 - 528.24] let me show you how long this is in

[526.72 - 529.6800000000001] comparison and part of the reason that

[528.24 - 531.519] it's shorter is because we're using text

[529.68 - 535.4399999999999] davinci o2

[531.519 - 537.6] so text davinci o2 is fine-tuned on on

[535.44 - 539.0400000000001] on the instruct series data so it's

[537.6 - 541.12] basically saying okay i'm going to put

[539.04 - 543.519] out you know one sentence a couple

[541.12 - 544.5600000000001] paragraphs sometimes you get run on

[543.519 - 546.72] stuff

[544.56 - 549.1999999999999] but with davinci o2 its output is

[546.72 - 550.72] generally very short

[549.2 - 554.48] especially compared to some other ones

[550.72 - 556.9590000000001] so this is this is what gpt3 put out

[554.48 - 556.9590000000001] and then

[558.959 - 562.56] this was what

[561.12 - 565.2] a professional wrote i don't know if

[562.56 - 567.279] anna wrote it or if um

[565.2 - 569.36] if a student wrote it but you see like

[567.279 - 572.88] okay so we've got

[569.36 - 575.2] um let's see 906 character response

[572.88 - 577.36] versus

[575.2 - 580.08] 5800 character response

[577.36 - 583.279] so we're not quite there but the quality

[580.08 - 584.08] of this response phenomenal right this

[583.279 - 585.68] this

[584.08 - 588.08] i would say like

[585.68 - 590.399] um the construction of this it is very

[588.08 - 592.72] obvious that someone is responding that

[590.399 - 594.8] this author is responding directly to

[592.72 - 596.64] this essay whereas you say like you know

[594.8 - 598.56] the the response title was contested

[596.64 - 601.279] territory okay that's not even the same

[598.56 - 605.1199999999999] title right in recent years like someone

[601.279 - 606.72] is just kind of summarizing it um

[605.12 - 607.6] but honestly

[606.72 - 609.2] uh

[607.6 - 611.76] this i don't i don't think that this is

[609.2 - 614.6400000000001] as good of a of an opening because

[611.76 - 616.399] someone is like whoever wrote this

[614.64 - 618.399] they're not actually saying that this is

[616.399 - 620.48] what anna mills claims there's just

[618.399 - 622.399] stating this is a fact and so it's not

[620.48 - 626.32] clear that this is actually a critical

[622.399 - 627.839] response just from the get-go um so

[626.32 - 629.519] that's my personal opinion i'm not an

[627.839 - 631.519] expert in this this is just i'm reading

[629.519 - 633.2] this and if this was an art like if i

[631.519 - 634.24] saw this as like a blog and someone was

[633.2 - 635.839] like you know

[634.24 - 637.6] critiquing someone else's blog i'd be

[635.839 - 639.6] like what are you who are you like

[637.6 - 641.44] contested territory

[639.6 - 643.0400000000001] okay i would search for contested

[641.44 - 644.399] territory like is that what you're

[643.04 - 645.279] responding to

[644.399 - 648.16] um

[645.279 - 649.6] the second paragraph seems seems spot-on

[648.16 - 651.68] uh mills questions the ethics of

[649.6 - 653.12] enforcing immigration laws

[651.68 - 655.4399999999999] that was you know

[653.12 - 657.12] gpt-3 picked up on that as well

[655.44 - 659.2790000000001] um

[657.12 - 661.44] while the essay argues for empathy it

[659.279 - 663.68] limits the scope of its argument to from

[661.44 - 664.6400000000001] offering comprehensive vision okay

[663.68 - 667.4399999999999] so we've got all the different

[664.64 - 670.16] components um so for the opening

[667.44 - 673.0400000000001] paragraph it seems like if we just use

[670.16 - 675.76] this whole thing that's fine

[673.04 - 679.12] but what i'm wondering is if we can

[675.76 - 680.959] break it up into sections so first

[679.12 - 682.5600000000001] let's just copy this prompt down because

[680.959 - 685.04] it worked

[682.56 - 685.04] so we'll do

[686.88 - 690.48] essay

[688.56 - 693.8389999999999] summary and critical assessment

[690.48 - 696.64] um okay so we'll save this as

[693.839 - 698.0790000000001] prompt01

[696.64 - 699.519] so we'll use this to generate the

[698.079 - 701.12] opening

[699.519 - 704.64] paragraph

[701.12 - 704.64] let's run it again just to see

[705.279 - 709.279] if it produces something similar so i'm

[707.6 - 711.279] guilty of this sometimes like i see one

[709.279 - 712.24] good output i'm like oh it's good

[711.279 - 716.4399999999999] um

[712.24 - 716.44] this it's almost identical

[716.88 - 720.639] okay yeah so the output is darn near

[719.279 - 723.68] identical let's turn up the temperature

[720.639 - 726.24] just to see if it gets really weird

[723.68 - 727.68] um so one thing is that um the quality

[726.24 - 728.8] of the instructions

[727.68 - 732.6389999999999] you know you see like there's a whole

[728.8 - 733.68] paragraph of instructions um whoops

[732.639 - 735.6800000000001] that actually

[733.68 - 738.399] can sometimes help sometimes if the

[735.68 - 739.76] instructions are not clear or if you're

[738.399 - 742.24] trying to do too many things it'll get

[739.76 - 743.2] confused

[742.24 - 745.76] okay

[743.2 - 747.519] so let's see our anna mills um

[745.76 - 749.04] challenges the morality

[747.519 - 750.72] yeah

[749.04 - 753.12] um she appeals to the reader's empathy

[750.72 - 754.24] asking to them to imagine strengths is

[753.12 - 756.32] delight in its emotional appeal and

[754.24 - 757.44] examine examination moral implications

[756.32 - 760.9590000000001] yeah okay

[757.44 - 763.36] so we've got that um but

[760.959 - 766.0] because we so there's a few there's a

[763.36 - 767.6800000000001] few like universal rules right um so

[766.0 - 769.2] what we want to do is break it down into

[767.68 - 770.399] smaller parts because

[769.2 - 773.6800000000001] um

[770.399 - 775.68] you know i think we do have weakness

[773.68 - 777.519] oh nope it didn't address the weaknesses

[775.68 - 780.399] so here's what i typically do when i

[777.519 - 782.8] want to deconstruct something um is i'll

[780.399 - 783.839] break it down into smaller and smaller

[782.8 - 787.76] parts

[783.839 - 790.1600000000001] um and so what i'll do is let's

[787.76 - 790.16] um

[791.44 - 795.519] well here let me make sure i've got a

[792.88 - 796.639] copy of the instructions

[795.519 - 797.44] nah no

[796.639 - 799.6] okay

[797.44 - 803.6] we got the instructions here

[799.6 - 803.6] and let's close that we don't need that

[803.839 - 807.2790000000001] um here's where i deconstructed it i

[806.0 - 808.079] actually don't like that let me close

[807.279 - 809.8389999999999] that

[808.079 - 812.2399999999999] i made a mess of it

[809.839 - 814.24] don't need that okay

[812.24 - 816.32] we'll get back to the script once we do

[814.24 - 817.44] some prompt engineering

[816.32 - 818.9590000000001] um

[817.44 - 821.1990000000001] yes

[818.959 - 821.199] so

[821.839 - 825.36] uh the key ideas including the main

[823.68 - 829.0] claim key reasons counter arguments

[825.36 - 829.0] rebuttals and limits

[831.36 - 833.839] all right

[836.639 - 839.6] let me

[838.32 - 843.279] now

[839.6 - 844.9590000000001] copy all this into a new prompt

[843.279 - 846.639] and all we're gonna do

[844.959 - 847.8389999999999] is we're gonna we're gonna pare this

[846.639 - 848.88] down

[847.839 - 852.0790000000001] so

[848.88 - 852.079] we want to summarize

[854.0 - 857.68] well here i'll borrow the same language

[855.839 - 860.8800000000001] that annie is so

[857.68 - 860.88] um we'll say write

[863.76 - 868.8389999999999] write a summary of the following

[866.399 - 871.44] essay

[868.839 - 874.5600000000001] um uh

[871.44 - 874.5600000000001] while focusing on

[875.36 - 879.6800000000001] focusing on the

[878.16 - 881.6] counter arguments

[879.68 - 884.3199999999999] rebuttals

[881.6 - 884.32] and limits

[886.72 - 891.44] assess

[888.079 - 894.76] the strengths and weaknesses

[891.44 - 894.7600000000001] of the argument

[902.639 - 904.9590000000001] okay

[910.639 - 916.16] so now let's take this

[913.92 - 918.4799999999999] and we're going to

[916.16 - 918.48] um

[918.639 - 921.839] assessment of

[922.48 - 927.76] strengths and weaknesses

[925.76 - 930.24] and if it's not apparent yet what i'm

[927.76 - 933.519] doing oh here let's just grab this

[930.24 - 933.519] hey yeah we can grab the whole thing

[933.839 - 939.12] and then we'll go grab the

[936.959 - 941.8389999999999] oops i closed it didn't i

[939.12 - 941.839] go back here

[945.519 - 949.04] so by breaking it down into smaller

[947.12 - 951.68] parts i'm basically going to say okay

[949.04 - 953.04] write each section separately so let's

[951.68 - 955.8389999999999] see what this does let's see if this

[953.04 - 955.8389999999999] works it might not

[956.56 - 962.56] let's turn this back down to 0.7

[960.079 - 962.56] and here we

[966.839 - 970.32] go so this is this is a little bit

[969.279 - 971.92] better

[970.32 - 973.6] um

[971.92 - 975.279] the essays weakness is that it does not

[973.6 - 977.12] offer any specific solutions to the

[975.279 - 978.639] problems the author admits that open

[977.12 - 981.519] borders would be dangerous but does not

[978.639 - 983.6] say how um we could regulate the border

[981.519 - 985.44] without criminalizing immigrants

[983.6 - 987.519] this lack of specificity leaves the

[985.44 - 989.519] reader wondering what exactly the author

[987.519 - 990.639] is advocating for

[989.519 - 992.72] not bad

[990.639 - 995.759] so i pointed out on the uh on the forum

[992.72 - 997.36] that gpt3 was trained

[995.759 - 998.48] a lot of reddit data so it's really good

[997.36 - 1000.16] at constructing arguments it's

[998.48 - 1001.839] frustratingly good

[1000.16 - 1005.759] let me run this again just to make sure

[1001.839 - 1005.759] that it's consistent in its performance

[1009.199 - 1012.959] let's see it also does not consider

[1011.36 - 1014.639] are not fleeing difficult circumstances

[1012.959 - 1016.7199999999999] but are instead seeking economic

[1014.639 - 1017.6800000000001] opportunities not bad

[1016.72 - 1019.36] okay

[1017.68 - 1020.7199999999999] um

[1019.36 - 1022.8000000000001] let's do a

[1020.72 - 1024.4] thorough assessment let's add thorough

[1022.8 - 1026.3999999999999] back in

[1024.4 - 1028.16] because i'm wondering if we can get a

[1026.4 - 1031.2800000000002] little bit more we can squeeze a little

[1028.16 - 1031.28] bit more juice out of this

[1032.72 - 1039.16] because if it writes one paragraph

[1035.6 - 1039.1599999999999] oh here we go

[1041.36 - 1044.24] oh much better

[1042.72 - 1047.039] okay

[1044.24 - 1047.039] yeah yeah

[1047.679 - 1050.679] okay

[1061.36 - 1065.039] all right so this will this will looks

[1063.2 - 1067.1200000000001] like it'll reliably generate two to

[1065.039 - 1069.28] three paragraphs sometimes one

[1067.12 - 1071.76] i really like it though

[1069.28 - 1074.3999999999999] so we'll update our prompt whoops where

[1071.76 - 1074.4] is the prompt

[1075.44 - 1079.6000000000001] go ahead and save this as prompt o2

[1078.08 - 1082.24] because this is like kind of the second

[1079.6 - 1084.24] part of the paragraph oh all right hang

[1082.24 - 1085.84] on my dog's outside gotta let him in

[1084.24 - 1086.72] okay i'm back

[1085.84 - 1088.08] um

[1086.72 - 1089.52] yes so

[1088.08 - 1090.559] write a

[1089.52 - 1092.32] summary

[1090.559 - 1094.72] write a thorough summary

[1092.32 - 1095.52] so it all comes down to

[1094.72 - 1099.1200000000001] um

[1095.52 - 1099.12] right word choice to get the uh

[1099.76 - 1103.84] to get the desired effect

[1101.76 - 1106.32] um so the prompto one this will generate

[1103.84 - 1108.72] our introductory paragraph we remove

[1106.32 - 1110.48] that verbage from this one

[1108.72 - 1113.679] where we say what was compelling

[1110.48 - 1115.1200000000001] persuasive troubling and actually so it

[1113.679 - 1116.3200000000002] did a really good job of doing strengths

[1115.12 - 1117.84] and weaknesses

[1116.32 - 1120.3999999999999] um

[1117.84 - 1122.3999999999999] let's actually separate prompt o2 out

[1120.4 - 1125.76] into a third prompt

[1122.4 - 1125.76] and we'll we'll do um

[1126.48 - 1129.919] so like

[1128.08 - 1132.96] this this prompto2 is going to be

[1129.919 - 1135.3600000000001] strengths and weaknesses um so let's

[1132.96 - 1138.0] focus on the compelling persuasive

[1135.36 - 1139.36] troubling unclear or problematic parts

[1138.0 - 1140.559] of this one

[1139.36 - 1143.1999999999998] so

[1140.559 - 1146.72] if we do um

[1143.2 - 1146.72] thorough assessment of

[1147.039 - 1151.679] let's see

[1150.24 - 1153.44] what was

[1151.679 - 1156.44] compelling

[1153.44 - 1156.44] persuasive

[1157.2 - 1161.76] troubling

[1159.2 - 1161.76] unclear

[1162.4 - 1167.679] oh whoops crap crap no

[1165.36 - 1169.039] i'm modifying the wrong one

[1167.679 - 1170.799] copy that

[1169.039 - 1172.0] go here whoops okay

[1170.799 - 1172.96] sorry

[1172.0 - 1174.799] my brains are a little bit like

[1172.96 - 1176.4] scrambled eggs this morning apparently

[1174.799 - 1178.799] prompto3 okay

[1176.4 - 1181.679] so let's leave let's leave the original

[1178.799 - 1184.4] prompt as it is but then

[1181.679 - 1186.3200000000002] um here we'll just

[1184.4 - 1188.64] we'll just copy this

[1186.32 - 1190.1599999999999] and do it all caps so someone asked why

[1188.64 - 1191.8400000000001] do i do caps

[1190.16 - 1193.44] um and that is because i think i've

[1191.84 - 1195.1999999999998] explained it before but just in case you

[1193.44 - 1197.76] haven't heard um

[1195.2 - 1199.6000000000001] a caps lock version of a word looks

[1197.76 - 1202.48] different to gpt3 it uses a different

[1199.6 - 1204.559] set of tokens um and so gpt3 will see

[1202.48 - 1205.84] like okay this is like

[1204.559 - 1208.48] and it looks like a block of

[1205.84 - 1211.36] instructions or something um okay

[1208.48 - 1212.96] so let's just change this

[1211.36 - 1214.8799999999999] and let's see if it let's see how much

[1212.96 - 1216.32] just changing the final

[1214.88 - 1218.159] kind of thing

[1216.32 - 1222.08] you know final instruction changes the

[1218.159 - 1222.0800000000002] nature of the output um

[1224.24 - 1229.96] well that was short maybe maybe maybe my

[1226.24 - 1229.96] intuition here was wrong

[1243.28 - 1246.8799999999999] okay this is pretty similar all right i

[1245.2 - 1248.72] think i think my intuition was wrong i

[1246.88 - 1250.7990000000002] don't think pro i think prompt 2 is fine

[1248.72 - 1251.679] as it is it looks like it got most of it

[1250.799 - 1253.9189999999999] in there

[1251.679 - 1258.4] um so let's go back to the original

[1253.919 - 1261.1200000000001] um problematic choose phrases like okay

[1258.4 - 1263.44] word choice is critical

[1261.12 - 1264.4799999999998] introductory

[1263.44 - 1267.6000000000001] okay

[1264.48 - 1267.6] well i mean

[1270.799 - 1274.4] let's just let's just start here with

[1272.24 - 1276.559] prompt one and two and just kind of run

[1274.4 - 1278.88] it a couple times and see what's missing

[1276.559 - 1280.6399999999999] because my brain is not giving me clear

[1278.88 - 1282.3200000000002] like signals as to like okay what is the

[1280.64 - 1283.5200000000002] next cognitive task that we're missing

[1282.32 - 1288.6789999999999] here

[1283.52 - 1288.679] okay so i've got this um

[1291.76 - 1295.6] let's see i don't think we need to do

[1293.039 - 1297.919] chunks in this one we'll just

[1295.6 - 1297.9189999999999] say

[1298.559 - 1303.52] text equals open file input.txt

[1301.84 - 1305.76] so that means we need to have an actual

[1303.52 - 1309.039] input

[1305.76 - 1311.039] so we'll do essay to critique

[1309.039 - 1313.2] and we'll save this as

[1311.039 - 1314.559] input.txt

[1313.2 - 1316.559] all right

[1314.559 - 1318.8799999999999] and then

[1316.559 - 1320.0] result equals list

[1318.88 - 1321.7600000000002] um

[1320.0 - 1324.32] so what i what i often do when i have

[1321.76 - 1326.08] like um when i have prompt chaining is

[1324.32 - 1328.08] i'll do um

[1326.08 - 1329.76] i'll do a variable called like prompt

[1328.08 - 1332.039] files equals

[1329.76 - 1335.679] and then i'll do um you know

[1332.039 - 1339.12] prompto1.txt and then

[1335.679 - 1340.5590000000002] prompt 02.txt

[1339.12 - 1342.799] and actually there's an even easier way

[1340.559 - 1344.72] since i'm following the same format

[1342.799 - 1347.76] make sure i import os

[1344.72 - 1347.76] so i'll do um

[1348.48 - 1354.159] prompt files equals os dot lister

[1352.32 - 1356.559] do the current directory

[1354.159 - 1358.7990000000002] and then

[1356.559 - 1361.12] actually put this in a list

[1358.799 - 1363.2] comprehension so this is a fun thing

[1361.12 - 1365.9189999999999] i 4 i n

[1363.2 - 1367.44] os lister where

[1365.919 - 1369.6000000000001] no if

[1367.44 - 1369.6000000000001] if

[1371.36 - 1375.76] prompt in i

[1373.44 - 1377.6000000000001] so what this does so python has this fun

[1375.76 - 1380.1589999999999] thing called list comprehension where

[1377.6 - 1383.52] you can actually declare and and

[1380.159 - 1385.3600000000001] populate a list in one go and so

[1383.52 - 1387.36] i for i you would see you would

[1385.36 - 1389.9189999999999] recognize this as instantiating a for

[1387.36 - 1392.08] loop so it's it's um so the variable

[1389.919 - 1394.24] name is going to be i and the for loop

[1392.08 - 1397.1999999999998] is for i n os lister so it's going to

[1394.24 - 1399.28] list all the files in this directory

[1397.2 - 1401.44] and then it will include it it'll

[1399.28 - 1404.3999999999999] include i so it'll include the file name

[1401.44 - 1406.0800000000002] if prompt is in the file name

[1404.4 - 1408.0] so this is a fun little one liner that

[1406.08 - 1411.12] you can do with python

[1408.0 - 1413.679] so then we'll do for

[1411.12 - 1415.4399999999998] file in

[1413.679 - 1418.159] prompt files

[1415.44 - 1420.64] so we'll just iterate through them

[1418.159 - 1422.88] um and then we'll do

[1420.64 - 1425.44] prompt equals open file

[1422.88 - 1428.64] um so we'll actually just replace this

[1425.44 - 1430.64] with i because i is now the file name

[1428.64 - 1433.2] and do sa

[1430.64 - 1435.679] and then we'll replace

[1433.2 - 1438.24] because we don't have any chunks anymore

[1435.679 - 1440.4] so then we'll say argument equals

[1438.24 - 1443.039] gpth3 completion from the prompt so

[1440.4 - 1444.88] we've populated the prompt

[1443.039 - 1446.72] and then the result

[1444.88 - 1447.7600000000002] is we're just going to accumulate it all

[1446.72 - 1448.559] together

[1447.76 - 1451.44] right

[1448.559 - 1452.8799999999999] and so we'll replace this with argument

[1451.44 - 1454.88] argument

[1452.88 - 1456.7990000000002] and then once it's done

[1454.88 - 1458.4] we can get rid of all this we're just

[1456.799 - 1461.039] going to save the file and we're going

[1458.4 - 1462.3200000000002] to have a double new line between each

[1461.039 - 1463.84] one and we're going to save it as

[1462.32 - 1466.6399999999999] output.txt

[1463.84 - 1468.799] so this is pretty compact

[1466.64 - 1470.88] and so again what this is called is

[1468.799 - 1472.48] called prompt chaining where it's like

[1470.88 - 1474.64] sometimes you take the output of a

[1472.48 - 1476.08] previous one i did this very extensively

[1474.64 - 1478.3200000000002] with like the summarizing and novel

[1476.08 - 1480.24] writing one but when you're constructing

[1478.32 - 1481.6789999999999] um like especially non-fiction where

[1480.24 - 1483.52] it's just kind of like one idea after

[1481.679 - 1485.279] another or one kind of dissection after

[1483.52 - 1487.6] another

[1485.279 - 1490.24] it's much much more procedural than

[1487.6 - 1492.3999999999999] especially than fiction um because each

[1490.24 - 1494.32] passage or paragraph in a in a

[1492.4 - 1497.44] non-fiction essay particularly if it's

[1494.32 - 1498.96] an argument where you're skewering one

[1497.44 - 1500.96] essay

[1498.96 - 1502.159] each each paragraph can kind of stand on

[1500.96 - 1503.919] its own okay

[1502.159 - 1505.679] so let's just run this real quick what

[1503.919 - 1508.0] is this okay i don't need that

[1505.679 - 1508.0] um

[1508.88 - 1512.64] yeah

[1509.919 - 1512.64] and we'll actually

[1512.72 - 1515.919] i will leave that in just so that you

[1514.159 - 1517.6000000000001] can see that it'll it'll it'll stick

[1515.919 - 1519.1200000000001] three arguments together

[1517.6 - 1520.1589999999999] um okay so

[1519.12 - 1523.52] cd

[1520.159 - 1527.44] gpt3 critical critical argument

[1523.52 - 1530.24] python critical argument dot pi

[1527.44 - 1530.24] well that was fast

[1532.48 - 1535.44] something is amiss

[1535.76 - 1540.84] did it generate an output no

[1538.32 - 1544.0] hold on hold the

[1540.84 - 1547.4399999999998] phone i bet i did something wrong

[1544.0 - 1547.44] i wonder i wonder if my um

[1548.88 - 1551.7600000000002] i wonder if that was it

[1555.2 - 1557.8400000000001] um

[1562.559 - 1566.48] print

[1563.76 - 1566.48] prompt files

[1567.76 - 1573.039] am i not getting anything hmm i have

[1570.24 - 1573.039] done something wrong

[1582.48 - 1585.6] duplicate

[1583.76 - 1586.799] i know i've fat fingered the syntax

[1585.6 - 1591.039] somewhere

[1586.799 - 1593.2] so let's just say os dot lister

[1591.039 - 1595.6] and then we'll add an exit right after

[1593.2 - 1595.6000000000001] that just

[1597.44 - 1600.64] okay yep

[1601.279 - 1604.64] okay so lister works

[1604.96 - 1608.2] oh wait

[1612.159 - 1617.44] hey there we go okay

[1615.52 - 1620.799] just lister with nothingness with no

[1617.44 - 1620.799] arguments that's how you uh

[1620.96 - 1625.44] that's what i did

[1622.32 - 1625.4399999999998] i is not defined

[1625.76 - 1630.48] what do you mean i is not defined

[1629.12 - 1631.36] oh

[1630.48 - 1633.84] derp

[1631.36 - 1635.84] i instantiated it here this is i so

[1633.84 - 1637.36] typically here's here's what i did wrong

[1635.84 - 1639.9189999999999] typically um

[1637.36 - 1642.6399999999999] for shorthand is you'll say you'll use i

[1639.919 - 1645.1200000000001] in a in an iterative iterable

[1642.64 - 1646.3990000000001] um variable in python so it's for i an

[1645.12 - 1648.4799999999998] iterable thing

[1646.399 - 1650.4799999999998] um and then i copy that instead of

[1648.48 - 1653.039] switching it to file

[1650.48 - 1655.76] um sometimes you sometimes you'd be like

[1653.039 - 1657.12] for i and prompt files um that's bad

[1655.76 - 1658.96] practice though because if you reuse the

[1657.12 - 1660.8799999999999] same variable name over and over again

[1658.96 - 1661.679] i've run i've run afoul of that before

[1660.88 - 1664.96] okay

[1661.679 - 1664.96] figured it out that's what i did wrong

[1666.24 - 1669.84] so let's see what it generates

[1673.36 - 1679.6789999999999] no such file or directory ah darn it i

[1676.0 - 1679.679] forgot to create my gbt3 logs

[1679.76 - 1685.2] always something

[1681.44 - 1685.2] gpt-3 logs

[1688.32 - 1691.6789999999999] third or fourth time's a charm

[1695.84 - 1698.1589999999999] okay

[1698.48 - 1704.799] and then what we'll do is i'll post this

[1700.88 - 1705.919] back on the forum and see what she says

[1704.799 - 1707.9189999999999] okay

[1705.919 - 1710.5590000000002] so now we've got the um

[1707.919 - 1712.159] now we've got the output populated

[1710.559 - 1714.72] reload it yes

[1712.159 - 1717.679] okay so it's only 2 000 characters long

[1714.72 - 1720.0] but that's not so bad

[1717.679 - 1722.3200000000002] um anna mills argues that illegal

[1720.0 - 1725.52] immigration is not unethical

[1722.32 - 1727.84] um migrants with edmonton respect

[1725.52 - 1729.279] okay didn't use the the title in this

[1727.84 - 1730.9599999999998] one though

[1729.279 - 1732.32] um all right so i

[1730.96 - 1734.08] some some stuff is starting to

[1732.32 - 1736.1589999999999] crystallize in my head

[1734.08 - 1739.559] um let me make sure i get a copy of the

[1736.159 - 1739.5590000000002] original instructions

[1740.799 - 1744.399] and ideally what we would do is actually

[1743.12 - 1747.1999999999998] have

[1744.399 - 1749.279] gpt3 generate the prompts that it needs

[1747.2 - 1752.48] so that is going to be a big thing in

[1749.279 - 1754.72] the future with artificial cognition is

[1752.48 - 1758.0] what's called cognitive control

[1754.72 - 1760.96] but we'll get into that at another time

[1758.0 - 1763.2] um okay so let's change

[1760.96 - 1763.2] this

[1763.52 - 1767.799] we're going to write the opening

[1777.44 - 1780.44] okay

[1782.64 - 1786.3200000000002] right the

[1783.84 - 1786.32] um let's

[1792.84 - 1796.559] see ah

[1795.039 - 1799.76] no

[1796.559 - 1799.76] oh this is a tough one

[1800.88 - 1804.88] oh oh oh okay i know what i should do

[1805.039 - 1810.1589999999999] i'm gonna pause it for a second because

[1806.559 - 1810.1589999999999] i need to do a little bit of tinkering

[1810.96 - 1815.52] okay we're back um

[1813.279 - 1816.72] this video i realized probably seems

[1815.52 - 1819.12] like it's a little bit rambling and

[1816.72 - 1820.32] unfocused and i'm taking a risk here

[1819.12 - 1822.0] because

[1820.32 - 1824.32] this is not a problem that i've thought

[1822.0 - 1826.64] about a lot and i just went in cold so

[1824.32 - 1829.039] i'm showing you my whole process of like

[1826.64 - 1830.7990000000002] okay let me take kind of initial stab at

[1829.039 - 1832.48] it and see what happens and then we kind

[1830.799 - 1835.44] of pull it apart and then

[1832.48 - 1838.559] go at it again so what i've done is

[1835.44 - 1840.96] rather than me design the argument i'm

[1838.559 - 1842.1589999999999] asking gpt3 now to design the argument

[1840.96 - 1843.679] so what i've done is i've written a

[1842.159 - 1845.679] prompt that says read the following

[1843.679 - 1847.6000000000001] argument and brainstorm the outline of a

[1845.679 - 1849.1200000000001] critical assessment write a thorough

[1847.6 - 1851.4399999999998] list of the key points in the essay with

[1849.12 - 1853.1999999999998] some critical evaluation of each focus

[1851.44 - 1854.559] on constructing a thorough evaluation

[1853.2 - 1856.159] and deconstruction of the argument

[1854.559 - 1857.279] presented below

[1856.159 - 1858.72] um

[1857.279 - 1860.96] so then i said thorough brainstorm

[1858.72 - 1863.76] outline points um

[1860.96 - 1866.559] yeah so that's that you know just

[1863.76 - 1867.679] let's see let's take thorough outline of

[1866.559 - 1869.44] points

[1867.679 - 1871.8400000000001] um and i've ran i've run this a couple

[1869.44 - 1873.6000000000001] times and it's pretty consistent

[1871.84 - 1875.519] um

[1873.6 - 1877.84] there we go

[1875.519 - 1878.799] oh much better

[1877.84 - 1880.8799999999999] okay

[1878.799 - 1882.559] so then what we do so this is this is

[1880.88 - 1884.24] cognitive control so what we're doing is

[1882.559 - 1887.36] we're asking first

[1884.24 - 1888.3990000000001] for gpthree to plan its argument

[1887.36 - 1890.8799999999999] um

[1888.399 - 1892.559] let's run this one more time just to be

[1890.88 - 1894.88] sure

[1892.559 - 1894.8799999999999] um

[1899.2 - 1902.64] this is writing first person

[1903.44 - 1910.72] okay i don't like how it did that

[1907.6 - 1913.12] we can also increase the maximum length

[1910.72 - 1913.1200000000001] um

[1919.12 - 1922.6399999999999] let's see let's say

[1921.12 - 1928.0] um

[1922.64 - 1928.0] describe the points in your own words

[1930.48 - 1935.32] um

[1932.32 - 1935.32] yeah

[1935.76 - 1938.32] there we go

[1943.76 - 1947.44] the author argues okay

[1947.679 - 1950.96] all right cool

[1948.96 - 1955.2] so let's copy this this will be our new

[1950.96 - 1955.2] first prompt let's just nuke this one

[1956.32 - 1959.9189999999999] and i know some of you will be like ah

[1957.919 - 1963.1200000000001] no save the thing

[1959.919 - 1966.0] essay thorough outline of points

[1963.12 - 1968.8799999999999] okay so this will be prompt01

[1966.0 - 1971.6] and then prompto2

[1968.88 - 1971.6000000000001] we will keep

[1973.279 - 1977.84] we will keep some of the original

[1975.44 - 1977.8400000000001] instructions

[1980.64 - 1984.3990000000001] um and so then we will but but

[1983.6 - 1987.039] but

[1984.399 - 1990.559] what we will do is we will ask to focus

[1987.039 - 1990.559] on a specific point

[1992.64 - 1995.6000000000001] okay write a thorough summary and

[1993.84 - 1998.399] critical assessment of the argument the

[1995.6 - 2000.799] summary should describe the key ideas

[1998.399 - 2004.76] we've already got that

[2000.799 - 2004.76] the summary should

[2004.799 - 2008.48] focus on the following

[2010.0 - 2013.6] let's see point

[2011.44 - 2016.48] and so then we'll do point and so what

[2013.6 - 2016.48] we'll do is we'll

[2016.799 - 2021.36] we'll copy paste the output one of these

[2020.399 - 2023.039] items

[2021.36 - 2024.4799999999998] so she poses the question of whether or

[2023.039 - 2027.279] not illegal immigration is actually

[2024.48 - 2029.2] wrong or unethical um

[2027.279 - 2032.919] and so then we'll say

[2029.2 - 2032.919] uh let's see

[2042.88 - 2046.5590000000002] we'll put this in quotes that should be

[2044.32 - 2046.559] fine

[2050.159 - 2052.639] let's see

[2052.879 - 2058.72] your assessment

[2055.76 - 2061.5200000000004] of the argument

[2058.72 - 2063.839] um your assessment of let's say of this

[2061.52 - 2063.839] point

[2064.32 - 2070.96] of this point should

[2066.639 - 2070.96] and we'll go down to here um

[2071.839 - 2075.839] discuss the strengths and weaknesses of

[2073.44 - 2075.839] the argument

[2076.8 - 2080.96] what was compelling persuasive troubling

[2078.48 - 2082.32] unclear problematic choose phrases like

[2080.96 - 2083.839] throughout to show the writer's purpose

[2082.32 - 2087.04] write mostly essay in your own words but

[2083.839 - 2089.119] consider using the occasional quote

[2087.04 - 2092.24] there we go and then we can remove the

[2089.119 - 2092.2400000000002] introductory paragraph

[2094.72 - 2100.16] um actually i think we need to

[2097.68 - 2103.2] bring that back

[2100.16 - 2104.48] so this will actually be like

[2103.2 - 2106.7999999999997] yes

[2104.48 - 2108.2400000000002] okay

[2106.8 - 2109.92] i know i'm jumping all over the place

[2108.24 - 2110.9599999999996] and i promise there is method to my

[2109.92 - 2112.56] madness

[2110.96 - 2115.68] um and i'm gonna give these better

[2112.56 - 2117.839] better names um okay so we'll start this

[2115.68 - 2117.839] with

[2118.64 - 2121.04] essay

[2122.88 - 2126.96] and then we'll do we'll go back to kind

[2125.119 - 2130.52] of what i originally had

[2126.96 - 2130.52] which was um

[2132.64 - 2135.2] i think it was something like critical

[2133.92 - 2138.48] assessment

[2135.2 - 2138.48] and evaluation

[2139.68 - 2142.0789999999997] thorough

[2143.28 - 2147.52] okay that's probably good enough okay so

[2145.28 - 2150.2400000000002] this this will be prompt

[2147.52 - 2151.839] um intro

[2150.24 - 2154.3999999999996] and this one we're gonna rename to

[2151.839 - 2156.0] prompt brainstorm so that way i can tell

[2154.4 - 2159.64] what the heck it's doing

[2156.0 - 2159.64] um prompt

[2160.88 - 2165.839] brainstorm

[2162.72 - 2168.24] and then no don't keep it in the editor

[2165.839 - 2170.839] this one is going to be

[2168.24 - 2173.359] um each point so prompt

[2170.839 - 2176.96] point whoops i've already got it open

[2173.359 - 2176.96] that's fine close all those

[2178.88 - 2181.6800000000003] prompt

[2180.24 - 2185.359] point

[2181.68 - 2186.96] and then we probably need a conclusion

[2185.359 - 2188.56] let's let's not get ahead of ourselves

[2186.96 - 2190.8] because we're already breaking this down

[2188.56 - 2192.4] into a meta prompt um which is the cool

[2190.8 - 2194.1600000000003] thing

[2192.4 - 2196.88] okay um

[2194.16 - 2198.8799999999997] so let's go back into here

[2196.88 - 2200.1600000000003] so now we can't just enumerate all the

[2198.88 - 2202.56] prompts and just run them in order

[2200.16 - 2205.68] because that won't make any sense

[2202.56 - 2206.7999999999997] so we'll do prompt files equals

[2205.68 - 2209.359] actually this is going to be super

[2206.8 - 2211.28] procedural

[2209.359 - 2215.04] so

[2211.28 - 2216.4] we have to just do this one at a time

[2215.04 - 2218.96] all right so

[2216.4 - 2220.64] right intro

[2218.96 - 2222.8] equals prompt

[2220.64 - 2226.2] so what did i name this it's

[2222.8 - 2226.2000000000003] prompt intro.txt

[2228.56 - 2231.839] and then we will do

[2234.56 - 2240.7999999999997] argument equals gpth3 completion prompt

[2237.359 - 2243.119] okay and then we will do um

[2240.8 - 2245.119] actually here we can just shorten this

[2243.119 - 2248.0] do result

[2245.119 - 2248.0] dot append

[2248.72 - 2252.56] okay

[2249.76 - 2256.8390000000004] and then let's do the brainstorm

[2252.56 - 2256.839] brainstorm the rest of my essay

[2258.64 - 2262.72] actually we'll say critique to use the

[2260.16 - 2266.96] right terminology okay

[2262.72 - 2266.9599999999996] and so then we do we do this and we do

[2267.04 - 2270.04] brainstorm

[2272.0 - 2279.92] and so in this case we'll do um

[2276.48 - 2279.92] key points equals

[2282.4 - 2288.079] dot split lines

[2285.76 - 2290.8] okay so what we're doing here is

[2288.079 - 2293.119] when gpt three re sends this back we're

[2290.8 - 2295.3590000000004] going to split it into lines um so that

[2293.119 - 2298.56] way then we can enumerate for each line

[2295.359 - 2298.56] right for each point

[2303.28 - 2305.76] let's see

[2306.4 - 2310.1600000000003] and i think we need to make them stand

[2308.0 - 2313.16] alone

[2310.16 - 2313.16] um

[2317.839 - 2321.32] that's not right

[2328.32 - 2333.2000000000003] okay this is better

[2330.96 - 2333.2] yeah

[2333.44 - 2337.52] so this is okay when it says the author

[2335.44 - 2340.8] believes

[2337.52 - 2342.8] so what i'll do is i'll add the author

[2340.8 - 2344.5600000000004] to the beginning of the prompt so what

[2342.8 - 2347.28] especially this works especially well

[2344.56 - 2348.88] with um davinci instruct if you want a

[2347.28 - 2350.7200000000003] list of things and you want it to follow

[2348.88 - 2352.2400000000002] a particular

[2350.72 - 2354.8799999999997] format you just kind of start it and

[2352.24 - 2357.2799999999997] it's like okay the author does what

[2354.88 - 2359.28] and then it'll follow that pattern

[2357.28 - 2361.92] so then what we do is we just add this

[2359.28 - 2363.52] back the author said something

[2361.92 - 2367.8] to the beginning

[2363.52 - 2367.8] of um of the first one

[2368.32 - 2371.3590000000004] yep that should be fine

[2374.88 - 2379.2000000000003] key points

[2376.56 - 2380.96] um so then we'll say

[2379.2 - 2385.68] key points 0

[2380.96 - 2385.68] equals key point actually we'll say

[2385.76 - 2388.4] the author

[2387.44 - 2389.599] plus

[2388.4 - 2392.1600000000003] key points

[2389.599 - 2393.3590000000004] 0. and the reason that i'm doing this

[2392.16 - 2395.44] is because

[2393.359 - 2396.72] this is going to get cut off

[2395.44 - 2398.079] it's not going to be part of the

[2396.72 - 2400.7999999999997] response

[2398.079 - 2402.8] so we want each each bullet point to be

[2400.8 - 2404.6400000000003] the same okay

[2402.8 - 2408.079] for

[2404.64 - 2408.0789999999997] point in key points

[2408.56 - 2413.599] now we get back into kind of this for

[2411.44 - 2416.4] loop

[2413.599 - 2417.92] um prompt equals open file and we're

[2416.4 - 2420.1600000000003] going to use the

[2417.92 - 2421.28] um

[2420.16 - 2422.839] prompt

[2421.28 - 2426.1600000000003] what did i call

[2422.839 - 2428.56] it the prompt point

[2426.16 - 2431.2] i come up with such original names

[2428.56 - 2433.359] prompt point dot text

[2431.2 - 2435.839] replace essay and then the argument is

[2433.359 - 2436.96] going to be gpt 3 completion we'll do

[2435.839 - 2438.72] that

[2436.96 - 2441.28] um

[2438.72 - 2442.64] yeah okay let's run this i think i think

[2441.28 - 2444.5600000000004] you guys will be surprised by this so

[2442.64 - 2446.4] basically what i've done is rather than

[2444.56 - 2450.319] me construct the argument i'm asking

[2446.4 - 2454.96] gpt3 to construct the entire argument

[2450.319 - 2457.04] because all i did was i said brainstorm

[2454.96 - 2458.96] i said brainstorm you know

[2457.04 - 2461.04] what the key points are and then in the

[2458.96 - 2463.28] first one um

[2461.04 - 2466.16] uh the intro i just said you know write

[2463.28 - 2467.8390000000004] the intro

[2466.16 - 2469.44] and especially so the introductory

[2467.839 - 2470.96] paragraph so that's what it's writing

[2469.44 - 2474.0] here

[2470.96 - 2475.599] okay um

[2474.0 - 2477.359] yeah so we've broken this down into

[2475.599 - 2479.119] three cognitive tasks which is write the

[2477.359 - 2480.88] intro brainstorm your points and then

[2479.119 - 2483.28] make an argument for each point let's

[2480.88 - 2486.56] see what happens

[2483.28 - 2486.5600000000004] cls to clear screen

[2486.96 - 2492.28] and then it blows up

[2488.96 - 2492.28] always does

[2504.72 - 2507.72] um

[2509.28 - 2511.8390000000004] what happened

[2518.96 - 2522.839] did i forget to do something

[2528.0 - 2530.56] um

[2531.599 - 2538.1600000000003] see 625 so did

[2534.8 - 2541.28] thorough assessment and evaluation

[2538.16 - 2544.72] yeah okay that looks right

[2541.28 - 2549.599] thorough outline of points the author

[2544.72 - 2551.2799999999997] oh that's what i did wrong i i yeah okay

[2549.599 - 2553.3590000000004] oops

[2551.28 - 2555.3590000000004] i used

[2553.359 - 2557.92] this one got to get rid of that we want

[2555.359 - 2558.96] that we want to preserve the new lines

[2557.92 - 2561.2000000000003] okay

[2558.96 - 2562.8] let's try that again

[2561.2 - 2564.64] so what happened was i went back through

[2562.8 - 2566.48] my logs this is why i keep logs and you

[2564.64 - 2567.92] see the response i said the author and

[2566.48 - 2569.839] then it begins by discussing but it's

[2567.92 - 2571.2000000000003] all on one line it's because sometimes

[2569.839 - 2572.48] what i like to do is compact the

[2571.2 - 2574.16] responses

[2572.48 - 2576.16] but in this case i don't want to compact

[2574.16 - 2579.16] the responses okay so let's try that

[2576.16 - 2579.16] again

[2603.119 - 2607.839] all right that's pretty typical for what

[2604.96 - 2607.839] we saw before

[2609.839 - 2615.44] yep

[2611.599 - 2615.44] it looks kind of repetitive

[2616.96 - 2620.48] so let's see what the final output looks

[2618.96 - 2621.839] like

[2620.48 - 2623.2] you see there's actually quite a few

[2621.839 - 2626.24] more steps

[2623.2 - 2628.0] so at 627 it ran it you know there was

[2626.24 - 2629.68] the introduction the brainstorm and then

[2628.0 - 2630.56] there was looks like four points that it

[2629.68 - 2632.3999999999996] made

[2630.56 - 2635.2] so let's go back out here and look at

[2632.4 - 2636.2400000000002] the output

[2635.2 - 2638.0] let's see

[2636.24 - 2639.5989999999997] this is a persuasive argument based on

[2638.0 - 2641.04] empathy and personal experience mills

[2639.599 - 2643.2000000000003] makes a compelling argument that illegal

[2641.04 - 2644.88] immigration is not necessarily wrong

[2643.2 - 2647.68] one weakness is that it does not offer a

[2644.88 - 2649.119] specific solution

[2647.68 - 2652.64] it looks like it's actually repeating

[2649.119 - 2652.6400000000003] itself almost verbatim

[2654.24 - 2659.7599999999998] let's take a look at some of those um

[2657.839 - 2660.7999999999997] some of these logs especially these last

[2659.76 - 2663.6800000000003] four because these are going to be where

[2660.8 - 2666.079] each point was oh that's what i did

[2663.68 - 2666.0789999999997] oops

[2666.16 - 2669.92] oh no wonder they look identical i'm not

[2668.4 - 2672.48] populating it

[2669.92 - 2675.04] um we're not using that we gotta we also

[2672.48 - 2677.119] got to replace um

[2675.04 - 2678.0] replace

[2677.119 - 2679.76] point

[2678.0 - 2681.68] good grief

[2679.76 - 2683.6800000000003] with the point

[2681.68 - 2686.48] because let's go

[2683.68 - 2688.16] to the gpt3 log and you see here where

[2686.48 - 2689.68] it's like the summary should focus on

[2688.16 - 2690.1499999999996] the following point

[2689.68 - 2691.7599999999998] point

[2690.15 - 2694.0] [Laughter]

[2691.76 - 2694.0] okay

[2695.359 - 2698.319] good grief i'm dumb

[2700.319 - 2704.8] you can tell i haven't had enough

[2701.599 - 2709.0] caffeine today yet

[2704.8 - 2709.0] it's also still 6 30 in the morning

[2719.839 - 2722.319] how long is this video while that's

[2721.2 - 2724.48] running

[2722.319 - 2726.88] oh this is 45 minutes yeah we're we're

[2724.48 - 2728.4] calling it here uh regardless but i

[2726.88 - 2731.44] think you guys get the point there we go

[2728.4 - 2733.52] i think this is probably good

[2731.44 - 2736.88] okay

[2733.52 - 2736.88] we're generating some output

[2739.359 - 2741.92] there we go

[2744.079 - 2747.2400000000002] oh wow

[2754.96 - 2759.56] it's kind of going back and forth but

[2756.319 - 2759.56] that's fine

[2760.48 - 2764.8] it is a little repetitive but this is

[2762.079 - 2764.8] certainly better

[2769.359 - 2772.48] okay

[2770.8 - 2774.7200000000003] so now let's see what the final output

[2772.48 - 2776.079] looks like reload it oh look at that

[2774.72 - 2779.1189999999997] this is long

[2776.079 - 2780.2400000000002] this is a 6000 character response i'm

[2779.119 - 2782.0] not going to read the whole thing but

[2780.24 - 2783.7599999999998] i'll save it in the output so you can

[2782.0 - 2786.4] see kind of what we've done

[2783.76 - 2788.2400000000002] and now you've seen meta prompting or

[2786.4 - 2790.56] prompt chaining

[2788.24 - 2791.7599999999998] in order to construct a very thorough

[2790.56 - 2794.48] argument

[2791.76 - 2796.0] i imagine with the right fine-tuning and

[2794.48 - 2798.319] refinement you could do the same thing

[2796.0 - 2800.16] for any kind of argument a legal

[2798.319 - 2802.8] argument or otherwise

[2800.16 - 2804.3999999999996] okay so i will go ahead and get this set

[2802.8 - 2806.4] up and um

[2804.4 - 2810.119] uploaded and uh you can check it out on

[2806.4 - 2810.119] github thanks for watching
