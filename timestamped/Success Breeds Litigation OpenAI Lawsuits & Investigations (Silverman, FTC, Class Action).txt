[0.0 - 5.94] morning everybody uh David Shapiro here

[2.639 - 8.58] with a video so many years ago

[5.94 - 12.120000000000001] I was listening to or watching a video

[8.58 - 13.46] about the founders of Google and they

[12.12 - 17.1] made a joke

[13.46 - 19.859] that success breeds litigation and that

[17.1 - 22.68] uh that little Mantra that truism has

[19.859 - 25.080000000000002] really kind of stuck in my mind for many

[22.68 - 26.698999999999998] years and uh it has proven to be true

[25.08 - 30.24] for open AI

[26.699 - 32.7] so I wasn't gonna make this video until

[30.24 - 36.0] I saw that like okay there's a few

[32.7 - 38.7] things stacking up so first there's the

[36.0 - 41.94] class action lawsuit against open AI so

[38.7 - 46.14] this is public filing uh which which has

[41.94 - 49.62] 15 allegations 15 causes of action and

[46.14 - 53.64] it's also got a handful of uh plaintiffs

[49.62 - 55.44] so uh I'm not a lawyer so first I just

[53.64 - 58.44] need to say that everything I say here

[55.44 - 60.599999999999994] is my uh amateur novice opinion I did

[58.44 - 64.79899999999999] however talk to a lawyer friend of mine

[60.6 - 67.38] uh about a civil procedure and uh how

[64.799 - 70.5] they might go about defending uh this so

[67.38 - 72.119] I do have a tiny bit of understanding

[70.5 - 75.36] um but and I'll also walk you through

[72.119 - 78.78] the process of what I have done anyways

[75.36 - 80.64] so with all that framing in place uh

[78.78 - 85.56] this is this is the class action lawsuit

[80.64 - 87.36] it's 157 Pages uh which is quite a bit

[85.56 - 90.54] um and it goes through all kinds of

[87.36 - 92.1] spicy stuff uh some of it seems kind of

[90.54 - 95.4] unrelevant like they're citing Stephen

[92.1 - 99.05999999999999] Hawking who is dead so I'm like

[95.4 - 100.74000000000001] okay I know that like they're they're

[99.06 - 103.74000000000001] they're trying to provide some context

[100.74 - 106.14] because here's the thing is uh in in

[103.74 - 108.72] conferring with my lawyer friend

[106.14 - 111.24] um he said that the primary audience of

[108.72 - 112.92] this kind of thing is the judge

[111.24 - 115.079] so the judge is going to read this and

[112.92 - 117.6] so you have to provide enough context so

[115.079 - 119.579] that the judge understands what's at

[117.6 - 122.399] stake here now with all that being said

[119.579 - 123.899] they cite stuff like Stephen Hawking and

[122.399 - 126.899] other people talking about like the

[123.899 - 129.479] existential risks of AI to humanity and

[126.899 - 131.72] then dive into civil complaints which

[129.479 - 134.459] I'm like okay these don't seem

[131.72 - 136.5] necessarily related but they also talk

[134.459 - 138.66] about stuff that is specifically germane

[136.5 - 140.64] to open AI for instance the fact that

[138.66 - 143.879] open AI started as an open source

[140.64 - 145.79999999999998] non-profit company and not as Elon Musk

[143.879 - 148.07999999999998] pointed out now neither of those is any

[145.8 - 150.18] longer true so you see that right here

[148.08 - 151.8] open AI was originally founded as a

[150.18 - 153.78] non-profit research organization with a

[151.8 - 155.76000000000002] single Mission but then it abruptly

[153.78 - 157.319] restructured itself and of course the

[155.76 - 160.319] way that it is

[157.319 - 162.48] um the way that it is worded is meant to

[160.319 - 164.7] be a little bit inflammatory because

[162.48 - 168.11999999999998] again you have to make it seem like yes

[164.7 - 170.33999999999997] the plaintiffs have a case here uh and

[168.12 - 173.58] so from a from a procedural standpoint

[170.34 - 175.31900000000002] what my lawyer friend said is that uh if

[173.58 - 177.06] you're defending against this first you

[175.319 - 180.48] try and get it thrown out on procedure

[177.06 - 182.04] is it filed in the correct uh Court

[180.48 - 184.92] um do the do the plaintiffs have

[182.04 - 189.42] standing uh and that sort of thing and

[184.92 - 191.7] and they're like uh if uh if if you have

[189.42 - 195.11999999999998] statutes versus procedure like you can

[191.7 - 198.29999999999998] win just on procedure so probably what's

[195.12 - 200.22] going to happen is as open AI they're

[198.3 - 202.44] lawyers their their counsel is probably

[200.22 - 204.42] going to try and get it dismissed just

[202.44 - 206.4] on you know grounds of like you know the

[204.42 - 208.79999999999998] plaintiffs don't have standing that sort

[206.4 - 209.94] of thing so one thing that was observed

[208.8 - 212.22] very quickly

[209.94 - 216.35999999999999] is that the plaintiffs here

[212.22 - 219.0] um are all Sudan pseudonym

[216.36 - 220.98000000000002] it's just it's just their uh their I

[219.0 - 222.659] can't say the word pseudonyms they use

[220.98 - 224.64] pseudonyms there we go

[222.659 - 226.14] um rather than their full names and they

[224.64 - 228.659] actually explain in this complaint that

[226.14 - 231.77999999999997] the reason that they did that is because

[228.659 - 233.099] um in other cases uh when when uh class

[231.78 - 235.019] action lawsuits have been brought

[233.099 - 237.48] against tech companies uh some

[235.019 - 239.64000000000001] plaintiffs have had uh have had death

[237.48 - 241.67999999999998] threats and have had to go into like you

[239.64 - 244.01899999999998] know hiding or or otherwise seek

[241.68 - 246.0] protection and so they argue that that

[244.019 - 249.299] using pseudonyms is legitimate here

[246.0 - 252.42] because uh because it's

[249.299 - 254.64000000000001] um it's generally like in in an interest

[252.42 - 257.579] of their safety uh but of course because

[254.64 - 260.28] we are a court system that values

[257.579 - 262.5] transparency these filings have to be

[260.28 - 265.44] made public so that's that's the first

[262.5 - 267.9] one and Oh and before we move on

[265.44 - 270.18] um some of the uh some of the complaints

[267.9 - 272.58] are some of the allegations are

[270.18 - 274.68] violations of electronic communications

[272.58 - 276.3] and privacy violation of Computer Fraud

[274.68 - 278.88] and Abuse Act violation of Cal

[276.3 - 280.16] California invasion of privacy unfair

[278.88 - 282.71999999999997] competition

[280.16 - 285.24] Illinois's biometric information privacy

[282.72 - 287.639] Illinois Consumer Fraud and deceptive

[285.24 - 289.139] business practices Illinois Consumer

[287.639 - 292.56] Fraud and deceptive business practices

[289.139 - 294.3] again negligence invasion of privacy in

[292.56 - 296.639] intrusion upon seclusion I'm not sure

[294.3 - 298.8] what that means larceny or a receipt of

[296.639 - 301.32] stolen property conversion I'm also not

[298.8 - 303.24] sure what that one is unjust enrichment

[301.32 - 305.94] so unjust enrichment means basically

[303.24 - 309.12] that uh you know one party was able to

[305.94 - 311.4] benefit uh unfairly from something that

[309.12 - 313.86] they received from another party and

[311.4 - 316.13899999999995] either I think either didn't compensate

[313.86 - 318.41900000000004] them correctly or had no business with

[316.139 - 320.46000000000004] that material in the first place failure

[318.419 - 321.9] to warn and then New York General

[320.46 - 325.44] business law

[321.9 - 328.79999999999995] so this is this is a very expansive uh

[325.44 - 331.139] complaint and it is 157 pages so that's

[328.8 - 334.44] the first one the second one that came

[331.139 - 337.32] out was Sarah Silverman of of all people

[334.44 - 339.6] who is a actress and comedian and a few

[337.32 - 341.699] others so Sarah Silverman Christopher

[339.6 - 344.52000000000004] golden and Richard Cadre I'm not sure

[341.699 - 346.68] who those other folks are but uh so this

[344.52 - 349.02] is this is also a class action suit but

[346.68 - 350.039] is much smaller it also demands a jury

[349.02 - 352.08] trial

[350.039 - 354.24] and they didn't list out the uh the

[352.08 - 355.979] infractions quite as cleanly here

[354.24 - 358.139] um but we'll get to how I how I

[355.979 - 360.59999999999997] processed all that and then finally is

[358.139 - 364.68] uh FTC versus open AI

[360.6 - 366.3] so the FTC has uh this is not a civil uh

[364.68 - 369.18] complaint this is an investig

[366.3 - 371.28000000000003] investigation uh from a regulator so

[369.18 - 372.84000000000003] it's a entirely different venue entirely

[371.28 - 375.0] different purpose

[372.84 - 377.419] um and basically this is just a demand

[375.0 - 379.8] for uh

[377.419 - 381.96] evidence and documentation and that sort

[379.8 - 383.699] of stuff it's a lot

[381.96 - 386.21999999999997] um the the the the things that they

[383.699 - 388.74] demand it's comprehensive

[386.22 - 390.66] um down to what data they collect how

[388.74 - 392.94] they collect it how they Safeguard it

[390.66 - 395.58000000000004] how their authentication Works who

[392.94 - 397.5] they've licensed it to all kinds of

[395.58 - 399.479] stuff so it's a very very wide-ranging

[397.5 - 403.38] comprehensive

[399.479 - 405.36] um uh demand CID so it was that civil

[403.38 - 407.58] investigation demand

[405.36 - 410.52000000000004] and so basically it's not they're not

[407.58 - 413.81899999999996] suing open AI they are investigating

[410.52 - 415.44] open AI for Regulatory Compliance and

[413.819 - 419.28000000000003] there's a lot of overlap between

[415.44 - 423.06] particularly this uh this one the FTC as

[419.28 - 425.15999999999997] well as the initial class action lawsuit

[423.06 - 427.38] um and so basically what I did was I

[425.16 - 430.02000000000004] scraped all the PDFs

[427.38 - 431.639] and in in some cases if a PDF is

[430.02 - 433.19899999999996] correctly printed

[431.639 - 434.94] um then all you have to do is just copy

[433.199 - 437.699] paste the text and then you can use it

[434.94 - 440.52] now for the class action one that's 157

[437.699 - 442.86] Pages it was like 450 000 characters

[440.52 - 445.139] which is super long there's also a lot

[442.86 - 447.06] of garbage a lot of wreckage that ends

[445.139 - 448.199] up in it like all the page headings and

[447.06 - 449.759] stuff and it looks kind of like this

[448.199 - 452.639] where you've got a whole bunch of

[449.759 - 454.319] Superfluous stuff so I used a bunch of

[452.639 - 455.46000000000004] regex to clean this up and I got it down

[454.319 - 457.8] to 360

[455.46 - 459.23999999999995] 000 characters uh so that's still that's

[457.8 - 462.12] still a good chunk of text and it's way

[459.24 - 464.759] way way more than uh anything open AI

[462.12 - 467.22] can consume right now but it's not more

[464.759 - 469.68] than Claude can consume

[467.22 - 473.09900000000005] um so same thing for uh Silverman this

[469.68 - 474.90000000000003] is a much shorter uh complaint it's only

[473.099 - 477.36] 17 pages

[474.9 - 479.099] oh and the the core thing about Sarah

[477.36 - 480.18] Silverman's

[479.099 - 482.15999999999997] excuse me

[480.18 - 484.62] um uh complain is it it's about it's

[482.16 - 488.58000000000004] fundamentally about copyright in short

[484.62 - 490.68] they allege that open AI uh used uh

[488.58 - 491.699] their their copyrighted works in the

[490.68 - 494.46] training

[491.699 - 496.62] and they cite some evidence as to why

[494.46 - 499.62] they believe that happen and their their

[496.62 - 502.56] assertion is that this is a violation of

[499.62 - 504.419] their rights uh the the particularly

[502.56 - 506.099] copyrights

[504.419 - 507.78] and we'll get into more detail about

[506.099 - 510.18] those in just a minute

[507.78 - 512.279] um now okay so that's what they allege

[510.18 - 514.979] uh and those are those are what I did

[512.279 - 519.06] for the FTC one so this is a thing is

[514.979 - 521.339] the US government is garbage at PDFs

[519.06 - 524.0989999999999] and so you go to the top and it's like

[521.339 - 526.08] okay you can't select anything

[524.099 - 528.72] um and then you come down here and it

[526.08 - 530.88] selects it in big giant blocks

[528.72 - 532.08] um and so we we saw this for like pretty

[530.88 - 535.68] much every time the US government

[532.08 - 537.24] releases a PDF it is freaking broken

[535.68 - 538.7399999999999] um whereas here you see like I can just

[537.24 - 540.48] highlight all of it and it's actually

[538.74 - 542.94] correctly formatted

[540.48 - 546.1800000000001] so what I had to do was I had to reprint

[542.94 - 548.82] this PDF using Microsoft PDF printer and

[546.18 - 550.92] then OCR it to get the text out all

[548.82 - 554.1600000000001] right so then what I did was I came over

[550.92 - 556.14] to Claude And I because Claude allows

[554.16 - 557.6999999999999] you to attach it I said hey so this is

[556.14 - 559.019] the Silverman one I said can you tell me

[557.7 - 560.76] the main causes of action in this

[559.019 - 563.279] complaint in other words what are the

[560.76 - 564.72] main allegations and so Claude says

[563.279 - 567.0] based on my review of the complaint oh

[564.72 - 569.1] and by the way uh do not use these

[567.0 - 570.72] models to actually defend yourself I'm

[569.1 - 572.16] just saying hey tell me what's in this

[570.72 - 573.899] document

[572.16 - 575.6999999999999] um I think that that's a fair and

[573.899 - 578.399] responsible use of language model

[575.7 - 580.98] technology is just tell me what's here

[578.399 - 583.2] so direct copyright infringement against

[580.98 - 584.4590000000001] openai for allegedly copying and using

[583.2 - 586.32] the plaintiff's copyrighted books

[584.459 - 589.14] without permission to train its AI

[586.32 - 591.0] models like gpt3 and chat GPT a

[589.14 - 593.1] vicarious copyright infringement against

[591.0 - 594.899] openai for the outputs of its AI models

[593.1 - 597.48] like chat GPT allegedly containing

[594.899 - 598.8] infringing derivative Works based on the

[597.48 - 601.6800000000001] plaintiff's books that were used in

[598.8 - 603.5999999999999] training violations of the Digital

[601.68 - 605.399] Millennium Copyright Act dmca for

[603.6 - 607.14] allegedly removing copyright management

[605.399 - 609.0] information from the plaintiff's books

[607.14 - 611.22] when using them to train AI models

[609.0 - 612.959] violations of California's unfair

[611.22 - 614.88] competition laws so that's you know this

[612.959 - 616.3199999999999] is something that's held in common with

[614.88 - 617.459] the other complaint and I'm not saying

[616.32 - 618.899] that they're working together when I say

[617.459 - 621.1199999999999] held in common I just mean that like

[618.899 - 623.399] they're making similar allegations

[621.12 - 625.5600000000001] negligence against open AI for allegedly

[623.399 - 626.88] breaching its duty of care so this is

[625.56 - 629.459] another thing the duty of care and

[626.88 - 631.56] negligence and then unjust enrichment

[629.459 - 633.7199999999999] again so both of these class action

[631.56 - 635.5189999999999] lawsuits cite that

[633.72 - 637.26] um let's see now the evidence so

[635.519 - 639.3] interestingly the Sarah Silverman case

[637.26 - 642.0] does cite evidence

[639.3 - 645.24] um uh in references AI open ai's own

[642.0 - 647.519] papers that discuss AI model training AI

[645.24 - 649.5] models like GPT one three and four on

[647.519 - 651.839] data sets of books including quote

[649.5 - 654.959] unpublished books and internet-based

[651.839 - 657.36] data sets this helps them allege that

[654.959 - 660.2399999999999] they copied books without permission it

[657.36 - 662.399] alleges the size of open ai's books 1

[660.24 - 664.76] and books 2 data sets appears to match

[662.399 - 666.959] the size of known book piracy sites

[664.76 - 669.42] suggesting openai might have used

[666.959 - 672.42] pirated books so that is a pretty

[669.42 - 676.56] damning indictment or allegation rather

[672.42 - 679.019] because okay if openai got on you know

[676.56 - 682.92] the tour Network and torrented uh you

[679.019 - 686.64] know book piracy uh you know that could

[682.92 - 688.019] be problematic uh it it remains to be

[686.64 - 690.779] seen though

[688.019 - 694.2] um again as a completely uneducated uh

[690.779 - 698.1] wild ass guess my guess would be is that

[694.2 - 700.9200000000001] one if openai even did that if they even

[698.1 - 702.839] if if they did pirate books they might

[700.92 - 705.12] have consulted their attorneys and said

[702.839 - 706.32] you're not you're not redistributing

[705.12 - 708.0] these books

[706.32 - 711.899] um and and in fact there is a fair

[708.0 - 715.5] amount of uh precedent set that that uh

[711.899 - 717.74] consuming data for models is not you

[715.5 - 721.019] know like that that it's not uh been

[717.74 - 723.12] it's not a violation uh that basically

[721.019 - 725.1] if you get if you get uh text Data from

[723.12 - 727.92] the internet you can always use that for

[725.1 - 729.6] training AI models now that if that

[727.92 - 731.3389999999999] precedent won if I understand that

[729.6 - 733.6800000000001] precedent correctly

[731.339 - 735.7790000000001] um and two if it's actually true that

[733.68 - 737.04] was still set before large language

[735.779 - 739.56] models

[737.04 - 741.7199999999999] so the idea that you could use uh

[739.56 - 743.9399999999999] pirated text for models would have been

[741.72 - 747.1800000000001] like for classification right

[743.94 - 748.94] um for for creating a bag of words uh

[747.18 - 751.56] classifiers that sort of thing not

[748.94 - 754.98] generators so remember generative AI is

[751.56 - 756.54] new so it has not been litigated in the

[754.98 - 758.519] context of generative AI because

[756.54 - 760.86] literally generative AI is only a couple

[758.519 - 763.74] years old so any precedent that had been

[760.86 - 767.16] set was based on Old School Technology

[763.74 - 770.1] so that's my again uneducated uh and

[767.16 - 772.26] only quasi-professional opinion

[770.1 - 774.6] um okay so it provides sample outputs

[772.26 - 776.1] from chat GPT accurately summarizing

[774.6 - 778.44] books written by the plaintiff authors

[776.1 - 780.899] this helps allege chat GPT was likely

[778.44 - 785.7600000000001] trained on those books so in this case I

[780.899 - 788.88] 100 disagree because if if the book was

[785.76 - 791.579] discussed on Amazon reviews on comments

[788.88 - 793.86] on Reddit uh it knows about the book

[791.579 - 795.2399999999999] just by virtue of

[793.86 - 797.279] um

[795.24 - 799.019] oh it's raining outside sorry I don't I

[797.279 - 801.12] if you hear the background noise it's

[799.019 - 802.44] raining um but you shouldn't anyways

[801.12 - 804.3] sorry

[802.44 - 807.0] um

[804.3 - 808.5] so you can ask it to summarize something

[807.0 - 810.18] that it hasn't read and all it's all

[808.5 - 812.579] it's doing is regurgitating the other

[810.18 - 815.04] summaries that it has already read and I

[812.579 - 817.68] realized this uh very early on when I

[815.04 - 820.1999999999999] went to chat gbt or gpt3 before it was

[817.68 - 822.3] chat GPT and I asked it to write the

[820.2 - 823.6800000000001] opening lines of like Of Mice and Men or

[822.3 - 825.5999999999999] something and it got it completely wrong

[823.68 - 827.6389999999999] it was just guessing it was just

[825.6 - 830.88] confabulating so that told me that it

[827.639 - 832.5600000000001] hadn't it maybe not Of Mice and Men but

[830.88 - 834.54] something more recent and copyrighted

[832.56 - 836.88] and that told me that it hadn't actually

[834.54 - 839.0999999999999] read the book that it was not in its

[836.88 - 840.72] training data but that it was that it

[839.1 - 842.5790000000001] knew about the book because it had read

[840.72 - 844.44] about people talking about it but then

[842.579 - 846.66] when I asked it to actually generate the

[844.44 - 848.5790000000001] material it couldn't

[846.66 - 851.519] um so I don't

[848.579 - 854.04] the basically the entire premise of this

[851.519 - 855.42] class action lawsuit could be wrong it

[854.04 - 857.459] all depends on what's in the training

[855.42 - 859.019] data but then if it is in the training

[857.459 - 860.04] data so there's there's several tests

[859.019 - 862.5] here

[860.04 - 864.48] if Sarah Silverman's books are in the

[862.5 - 865.74] training data then it still has to be

[864.48 - 867.839] litigated and there still has to be

[865.74 - 870.3] several tests of is this actually a

[867.839 - 874.32] copyright violation because if it only

[870.3 - 876.66] regurgitates a summary then who cares

[874.32 - 878.399] right if it's not actually you know

[876.66 - 880.98] you're allowed to talk about a book

[878.399 - 882.899] right but if it's not actually if it if

[880.98 - 886.139] it doesn't actually mentally contain

[882.899 - 889.44] Sarah Silverman's actual copyrighted

[886.139 - 891.66] material then uh anything that it's

[889.44 - 893.94] producing is just confabulation or

[891.66 - 895.86] hallucination because it thinks it knows

[893.94 - 898.1990000000001] about the book by virtue of having read

[895.86 - 900.839] about other people and so it's inferring

[898.199 - 904.3199999999999] or imputing about the copyrighted works

[900.839 - 905.8800000000001] now that being said if this is the

[904.32 - 908.22] because this this will come out in

[905.88 - 911.639] Discovery so from a technical standpoint

[908.22 - 915.36] I would be really curious to know what

[911.639 - 918.24] happens if it one like okay so whether

[915.36 - 921.1800000000001] or not open AI used copyrighted books

[918.24 - 923.339] might not be the point here because if

[921.18 - 925.68] the model knows enough about the

[923.339 - 928.1990000000001] copyrighted material to still infringe

[925.68 - 931.1389999999999] upon their rights that could be a really

[928.199 - 935.3389999999999] serious blow to to the um to the the

[931.139 - 936.839] ability to use open source data sets now

[935.339 - 940.32] that being said

[936.839 - 942.6600000000001] uh generative AI is is generating more

[940.32 - 944.7600000000001] text than humans are now uh you know

[942.66 - 947.3389999999999] open AIS models generate literally

[944.76 - 950.04] billions of words per day probably per

[947.339 - 952.32] hour at this point honestly and so

[950.04 - 954.0] basically what's going to happen is if

[952.32 - 956.339] here's what I expect is going to happen

[954.0 - 958.98] and I listened to some of the um the the

[956.339 - 960.7790000000001] uh us United States Congress

[958.98 - 963.0] Congressional hearing on copyright and

[960.779 - 965.459] Ai and so basically what's going to

[963.0 - 967.139] happen is that if if human produce

[965.459 - 969.899] copyrighted material is just too

[967.139 - 972.24] dangerous to use then every AI shop is

[969.899 - 975.3] just going to switch to 100 AI generated

[972.24 - 977.82] everything whether it's images text uh

[975.3 - 979.3199999999999] music whatever and so then you're you're

[977.82 - 981.3000000000001] just going to force them to take humans

[979.32 - 982.74] out of the loop entirely and you're

[981.3 - 984.899] going to create an entirely separate

[982.74 - 986.699] information domain that's kind of what I

[984.899 - 988.5] think is going to happen anyways just

[986.699 - 992.3389999999999] because just by sheer virtue of the fact

[988.5 - 994.44] that most uh digital media is going to

[992.339 - 997.3800000000001] be produced by AI before before long

[994.44 - 999.899] anyways this could be one of the first

[997.38 - 1001.639] components of that it lists registered

[999.899 - 1003.98] copyrights owned by the plaintiff offer

[1001.639 - 1005.72] plaintiff authors

[1003.98 - 1008.6] showing they have valid copyrights okay

[1005.72 - 1010.82] sure all right so

[1008.6 - 1012.98] um and I so then I asked like as a as a

[1010.82 - 1014.4200000000001] matter of procedure could open AI be

[1012.98 - 1016.519] subpoenaed otherwise compelled to share

[1014.42 - 1019.2199999999999] evidence such as their training data

[1016.519 - 1022.1] yes so here's the thing here's what's

[1019.22 - 1024.679] really going to be interesting is that

[1022.1 - 1026.419] um now obviously open AI has rights to

[1024.679 - 1028.939] protect their Trade Secrets and that

[1026.419 - 1031.5790000000002] sort of thing but

[1028.939 - 1033.559] um they they can they can do depositions

[1031.579 - 1035.36] they can serve document requests they

[1033.559 - 1038.839] can do all kinds of stuff to try and

[1035.36 - 1041.6] compel open AI to like prove whether or

[1038.839 - 1043.339] not they used this information

[1041.6 - 1047.48] um now so that's going to be really

[1043.339 - 1049.6399999999999] interesting again uh you know the courts

[1047.48 - 1052.58] do their best to try and respect

[1049.64 - 1054.6200000000001] um uh private information intellectual

[1052.58 - 1056.6599999999999] property uh Trade Secrets and that sort

[1054.62 - 1059.0] of stuff

[1056.66 - 1060.98] um but really the core issue here is is

[1059.0 - 1062.48] a matter of copyright

[1060.98 - 1064.7] um and then the damages of course would

[1062.48 - 1067.22] be based on

[1064.7 - 1069.98] um you know any any economic loss there

[1067.22 - 1072.08] but also violation of Rights so here's

[1069.98 - 1074.72] the thing with with um that I'm learning

[1072.08 - 1076.6399999999999] about this is that there has to be an

[1074.72 - 1078.2] injury to the plaintiff and the injury

[1076.64 - 1080.2990000000002] could be Financial loss it could be

[1078.2 - 1082.16] emotional harm it and it can also just

[1080.299 - 1083.9] be a violation of Rights like you

[1082.16 - 1086.0] violated my rights and that is the end

[1083.9 - 1086.96] that is the injury

[1086.0 - 1088.88] um

[1086.96 - 1091.76] and so then what I talked what I talked

[1088.88 - 1092.96] about here is is this uh you know I said

[1091.76 - 1094.28] my view is that the model very well

[1092.96 - 1095.66] could know about the plaintiffs works by

[1094.28 - 1097.94] sheer virtue of reading about people

[1095.66 - 1099.6200000000001] talking about it on Reddit it could then

[1097.94 - 1101.299] infer or impute the contents of the

[1099.62 - 1102.559] copyrighted material but that would have

[1101.299 - 1104.12] to be litigated and come out in

[1102.559 - 1106.6399999999999] Discovery

[1104.12 - 1109.4599999999998] um you know so it's like maybe it just

[1106.64 - 1111.98] knows about the material and has never

[1109.46 - 1113.96] actually seen it and if it hasn't I

[1111.98 - 1116.299] suspect that this uh that this class

[1113.96 - 1117.8600000000001] action lawsuit is dead in the water it

[1116.299 - 1120.2] could get appealed

[1117.86 - 1122.7199999999998] um but but really if it comes down to

[1120.2 - 1125.539] like if they have if they cannot compel

[1122.72 - 1127.7] open AI or provide any evidence that

[1125.539 - 1129.919] openai used their copyrighted material

[1127.7 - 1133.7] then everything else that it is capable

[1129.919 - 1135.44] of is an emergent capability of uh the

[1133.7 - 1137.179] training process

[1135.44 - 1138.3200000000002] you know by learning general concepts

[1137.179 - 1140.48] and styles of writing allowed to

[1138.32 - 1142.46] convince and Link generate content in a

[1140.48 - 1143.96] similar voice but without copyrighting

[1142.46 - 1145.7] the specifics obviously this is just

[1143.96 - 1148.4] discussing it I'm not saying that this

[1145.7 - 1149.9] is this is the actual legal test

[1148.4 - 1151.2800000000002] um but just kind of talking about the

[1149.9 - 1153.2] issue

[1151.28 - 1154.7] um yep so that they would they would

[1153.2 - 1156.799] need to prove it

[1154.7 - 1159.919] um let's see

[1156.799 - 1162.9189999999999] now the the implications the

[1159.919 - 1164.6000000000001] ramifications of this which honestly I

[1162.919 - 1166.64] don't I personally don't think that the

[1164.6 - 1168.3799999999999] Silverman versus open AI case has much

[1166.64 - 1169.76] water I don't think I don't think it's

[1168.38 - 1173.0] airtight

[1169.76 - 1177.62] um but if it does proceed this could be

[1173.0 - 1180.86] a precedent setting uh case and so uh

[1177.62 - 1182.1789999999999] like the like let's assume for the sake

[1180.86 - 1183.3799999999999] of arguments so this is this is

[1182.179 - 1186.0800000000002] something that my lawyer friend told me

[1183.38 - 1188.1200000000001] is if you if you ex like if you just

[1186.08 - 1190.1] accept it at face value

[1188.12 - 1191.8999999999999] you say let's assume that everything

[1190.1 - 1194.8999999999999] that you're accused of is actually true

[1191.9 - 1196.8200000000002] is it still going to stand so here's

[1194.9 - 1199.16] here's another way that that lawsuits

[1196.82 - 1200.539] can get thrown out is like okay like for

[1199.16 - 1202.88] the sake of argument let's assume that

[1200.539 - 1205.16] all allegations are true or the that are

[1202.88 - 1207.0200000000002] factually accurate it still is not a

[1205.16 - 1207.799] violation of the law because here's the

[1207.02 - 1209.72] thing

[1207.799 - 1211.46] they didn't provide any evidence that

[1209.72 - 1213.799] chat GPT will regurgitate Sarah

[1211.46 - 1216.44] Silverman's work and so then it's like

[1213.799 - 1218.12] okay if if it's only talking about it

[1216.44 - 1220.46] and in the slight you know vaguely

[1218.12 - 1223.1599999999999] similar tone that's not a violation of

[1220.46 - 1224.9] her copyright and if if also if she

[1223.16 - 1227.0] can't provide any evidence that she's

[1224.9 - 1228.98] had Financial loss from it so there's

[1227.0 - 1231.38] there's no Financial loss so that that's

[1228.98 - 1233.0] not an injury so then the case basically

[1231.38 - 1235.4] hinges on

[1233.0 - 1237.919] um infringing her rights

[1235.4 - 1239.96] um but again like

[1237.919 - 1242.24] it didn't ingest it if it didn't

[1239.96 - 1244.039] actually take it then like I don't know

[1242.24 - 1245.96] I I personally don't see it holding up

[1244.039 - 1247.76] in court but again I am not a lawyer

[1245.96 - 1249.559] this is not legal advice this is just my

[1247.76 - 1251.179] uneducated opinion

[1249.559 - 1254.059] um on the on the thing

[1251.179 - 1256.4] now that being said because generative

[1254.059 - 1258.74] AI is a new technology

[1256.4 - 1260.1200000000001] um uh Claude accurately point out courts

[1258.74 - 1261.98] may have to devise new tests for

[1260.12 - 1264.26] determining if AI outputs infringe

[1261.98 - 1266.539] derivatives based on copyrighted

[1264.26 - 1269.24] training data existing legal tests may

[1266.539 - 1270.3799999999999] not apply neatly so this is that that's

[1269.24 - 1273.86] why I mean that this might be a

[1270.38 - 1275.9] precedent setting case because if they

[1273.86 - 1278.4189999999999] do if it doesn't get thrown out just

[1275.9 - 1279.8600000000001] outright then the courts are going to

[1278.419 - 1282.5] have to argue and come up with a new

[1279.86 - 1284.6599999999999] test to say okay yes you can write

[1282.5 - 1286.64] something in the alleged voice of Sarah

[1284.66 - 1289.22] Silverman and you can talk about her

[1286.64 - 1291.5] book and you know you know like the tone

[1289.22 - 1295.28] and style and everything does that

[1291.5 - 1297.2] constitute an IP violation and that will

[1295.28 - 1299.6589999999999] that could have far-ranging

[1297.2 - 1302.24] ramifications because then it's like

[1299.659 - 1305.6000000000001] okay you know make me an image in the

[1302.24 - 1308.659] style of you know Botticelli or whatever

[1305.6 - 1311.1789999999999] um then if this if that doesn't stand

[1308.659 - 1314.2990000000002] then just cloning the style of someone

[1311.179 - 1316.76] because the AI model has learned to

[1314.299 - 1318.5] imitate the style from someone even if

[1316.76 - 1320.24] it hasn't seen their work just by

[1318.5 - 1321.799] looking at descriptions of it looking at

[1320.24 - 1324.919] similar things

[1321.799 - 1328.58] then we could see some really really uh

[1324.919 - 1330.3200000000002] interesting uh legal Fallout from this

[1328.58 - 1332.059] um another thing is there may be Ripple

[1330.32 - 1333.6789999999999] effects establishing rights around other

[1332.059 - 1335.1789999999999] kinds of data usage like plagiarism

[1333.679 - 1337.46] detection Services scanning student

[1335.179 - 1340.1000000000001] essays you might have seen in the news

[1337.46 - 1342.2] recently that all the AI detectors are

[1340.1 - 1344.12] freaking garbage there was one AI

[1342.2 - 1346.3400000000001] detector that like basically threw out

[1344.12 - 1348.1399999999999] every student essay that was written by

[1346.34 - 1351.1999999999998] non-native English speaker so it's like

[1348.14 - 1352.76] Yay algorithmic racism like if you're

[1351.2 - 1354.5] not a native English speaker then like

[1352.76 - 1357.2] okay we're just going to accuse you of

[1354.5 - 1359.059] plagiarism and it's it's like that's

[1357.2 - 1360.919] that's not fair

[1359.059 - 1363.08] um so we need we need to be careful

[1360.919 - 1365.6000000000001] about that that is not an issue here as

[1363.08 - 1368.48] far as I can tell in the Silverman case

[1365.6 - 1370.28] but uh yeah all right so the next one is

[1368.48 - 1373.46] the big class action lawsuit so here's

[1370.28 - 1375.2] the interesting thing is this is 352

[1373.46 - 1377.3600000000001] kilobytes

[1375.2 - 1380.78] um and I was able to and because I was

[1377.36 - 1382.1] able to get uh get it down to uh what

[1380.78 - 1383.96] 360

[1382.1 - 1386.059] 000 characters Claude is able to read

[1383.96 - 1388.22] the whole thing all in one go

[1386.059 - 1390.74] um so this is really these tools are

[1388.22 - 1393.799] going to really accelerate uh lots of

[1390.74 - 1397.22] stuff because this is 157 pages of text

[1393.799 - 1399.679] that it's able to read all at once

[1397.22 - 1401.1200000000001] and so I said okay can you tell me the

[1399.679 - 1402.14] main causes of action in this complaint

[1401.12 - 1403.1] in other words what are the main

[1402.14 - 1405.7990000000002] allegations

[1403.1 - 1407.8999999999999] so we already kind of went over that

[1405.799 - 1409.1] um but like negligent the negligence and

[1407.9 - 1410.9] the development and release of AI

[1409.1 - 1413.12] products without sufficient testing or

[1410.9 - 1414.6200000000001] safeguards unjust enrichment deceptive

[1413.12 - 1417.32] practices and lack of transparency

[1414.62 - 1419.6589999999999] violation of privacy rights

[1417.32 - 1422.299] um so again some of it this one is

[1419.659 - 1425.24] primarily about privacy rights rather

[1422.299 - 1426.679] than copyright uh infringement

[1425.24 - 1429.2] um and so then it's like you know

[1426.679 - 1431.0] biometric privacy laws privacy privacy

[1429.2 - 1433.4] privacy

[1431.0 - 1435.98] and uh so then you know does it cite

[1433.4 - 1439.159] evidence it references expert opinions

[1435.98 - 1441.26] such as Jeff Hinton multiple consumer

[1439.159 - 1444.5] surveys shutting showing expectations of

[1441.26 - 1446.78] privacy and lack of consent uh ftc's

[1444.5 - 1450.32] recent settlement with Amazon regarding

[1446.78 - 1452.12] Alexa uh California and federal laws

[1450.32 - 1454.1589999999999] like parental consent so one of the one

[1452.12 - 1456.9189999999999] of the things in this in the uh class

[1454.159 - 1458.5390000000002] action version versus open AI is that

[1456.919 - 1460.7] children have been able to use it and

[1458.539 - 1462.559] sign up and that then that openai didn't

[1460.7 - 1464.6000000000001] do their due diligence to prevent

[1462.559 - 1466.94] children from using the tool but again

[1464.6 - 1469.1] like even if you accept that as true is

[1466.94 - 1470.3600000000001] that actually a legitimate complaint I

[1469.1 - 1472.6999999999998] don't know

[1470.36 - 1475.76] um but it's like you know children can

[1472.7 - 1477.5] you know order stuff on Amazon just by

[1475.76 - 1478.58] borrowing their parents phone so I don't

[1477.5 - 1480.98] know

[1478.58 - 1482.299] uh it alleges specific data sources like

[1480.98 - 1483.44] Reddit that were supposedly scraped

[1482.299 - 1486.1399999999999] without permission based on public

[1483.44 - 1488.1200000000001] comments uh Reddit and Twitter those you

[1486.14 - 1490.5200000000002] know they there's been quite a lot going

[1488.12 - 1492.7399999999998] around on with Reddit and Twitter and

[1490.52 - 1494.36] public data uh or whether or not the

[1492.74 - 1497.24] data is public

[1494.36 - 1498.9799999999998] um alleged alleges instances of data

[1497.24 - 1501.02] usage violations like Snapchat denying

[1498.98 - 1502.82] the use of location data the chat GPT

[1501.02 - 1504.3799999999999] then revealed it was accessing so that's

[1502.82 - 1506.72] interesting

[1504.38 - 1507.74] um it references open ai's own

[1506.72 - 1510.26] acknowledgments regarding

[1507.74 - 1512.26] unpredictability of AI systems it cites

[1510.26 - 1514.76] multiple examples of AI harms like

[1512.26 - 1516.02] defamatory content to establish the

[1514.76 - 1517.64] risks

[1516.02 - 1519.799] so then I asked what are the primary

[1517.64 - 1521.1200000000001] injuries like what is it that they're

[1519.799 - 1523.1589999999999] actually complaining about that that

[1521.12 - 1525.26] there's that they want uh you know

[1523.159 - 1528.2] relief from so loss of control over

[1525.26 - 1530.6589999999999] their private data so again privacy loss

[1528.2 - 1532.88] of autonomy and parental control uh for

[1530.659 - 1535.22] data collected from miners that could be

[1532.88 - 1537.5590000000002] bad a violation of privacy rights and

[1535.22 - 1540.44] lack of transparency uh exposure to

[1537.559 - 1542.6] privacy security and other risks such as

[1540.44 - 1544.96] emotional risk inability to effectively

[1542.6 - 1547.6999999999998] opt out or have their data deleted which

[1544.96 - 1549.38] uh open AI already fixed that because of

[1547.7 - 1551.419] Italy complaining about chat GPT

[1549.38 - 1553.3400000000001] actually so thank you Italy for

[1551.419 - 1556.3400000000001] complaining about Chad GPT and enforcing

[1553.34 - 1557.779] gdpr compliance and then finally loss of

[1556.34 - 1559.1] economic value of their data which

[1557.779 - 1561.5] defendants profited from without

[1559.1 - 1563.059] compensation to users so basically

[1561.5 - 1566.299] they're saying that like okay the data

[1563.059 - 1567.86] that you scraped uh has value and you're

[1566.299 - 1571.46] profiting from the data that was

[1567.86 - 1572.4189999999999] ill-gotten is my reading of that uh okay

[1571.46 - 1574.7] cool

[1572.419 - 1576.3200000000002] and then I asked about from a civil

[1574.7 - 1578.0] procedure standpoint like what is the

[1576.32 - 1580.9399999999998] venue uh what is the subject matter

[1578.0 - 1582.98] jurisdiction uh the parties class action

[1580.94 - 1584.24] claims relief sought

[1582.98 - 1586.039] um it's all that's all pretty

[1584.24 - 1589.1] straightforward but really the core

[1586.039 - 1591.44] thing at issue here is privacy rights

[1589.1 - 1593.48] um and and then open ai's Duty

[1591.44 - 1595.88] um and due diligence and then finally

[1593.48 - 1597.5] the FTC com uh it's not a complaint it's

[1595.88 - 1600.8600000000001] an investigation

[1597.5 - 1602.6] um the FTC investigation uh is just you

[1600.86 - 1603.9799999999998] know like did they make false and

[1602.6 - 1605.6589999999999] misleading claims about its products

[1603.98 - 1607.58] capabilities

[1605.659 - 1609.5590000000002] um the FTC is concerned about open ai's

[1607.58 - 1611.4189999999999] model it might improperly reveal

[1609.559 - 1613.46] personal information and remember there

[1611.419 - 1615.98] have been those leaks right where chat

[1613.46 - 1617.779] GPT like would suddenly give you

[1615.98 - 1619.52] information from someone else's chats

[1617.779 - 1621.02] which that's a really weird thing I'm

[1619.52 - 1623.299] not sure how that happened because like

[1621.02 - 1625.9] like seriously guys internal data

[1623.299 - 1628.94] governance data controls how do you

[1625.9 - 1630.44] cross-pollinate uh user chats especially

[1628.94 - 1633.26] when you've got them all identified with

[1630.44 - 1634.3400000000001] uuids that's why you use you IDs is

[1633.26 - 1637.039] because they're universally unique

[1634.34 - 1639.86] identifiers if it's not the right uuid

[1637.039 - 1641.779] don't share that with someone else

[1639.86 - 1643.52] um let's see FTC is concerned with open

[1641.779 - 1644.539] ai's models oh wait no I already read

[1643.52 - 1647.12] that one

[1644.539 - 1648.44] um FTC wants info on open ai's data

[1647.12 - 1650.299] collection storage and used practices

[1648.44 - 1652.22] including what user data is collected

[1650.299 - 1653.779] and retained and how users can access

[1652.22 - 1656.179] delete or opt out of data collection

[1653.779 - 1657.98] which of course they fix that

[1656.179 - 1659.72] um it seeks info on opening eyes model

[1657.98 - 1661.58] training including data sources and

[1659.72 - 1664.159] reviewing and filtering of training data

[1661.58 - 1666.62] so again at issue for for all of these

[1664.159 - 1668.179] complaints is what data goes into the

[1666.62 - 1670.58] model training

[1668.179 - 1673.64] um you know is it copyrighted is it is

[1670.58 - 1674.96] it uh you know is it private data and

[1673.64 - 1677.0590000000002] then what do they well how do they

[1674.96 - 1679.299] protect and safeguard that data

[1677.059 - 1682.1589999999999] security practices and data breaches

[1679.299 - 1685.34] oversight of third-party services built

[1682.159 - 1686.779] on its API so this is you know the all

[1685.34 - 1690.559] their safety constraints and that sort

[1686.779 - 1692.419] of stuff there's all kinds of stuff

[1690.559 - 1695.12] um it's it's a comprehensive

[1692.419 - 1696.74] investigation it's very wide-ranging

[1695.12 - 1698.6589999999999] um it doesn't cite anything specific

[1696.74 - 1700.34] although I don't necessarily agree with

[1698.659 - 1704.0590000000002] that because it does cite some some of

[1700.34 - 1706.52] the events from uh from openai for

[1704.059 - 1707.96] instance that that case of chat GPT

[1706.52 - 1712.58] leaking

[1707.96 - 1712.58] um leaking uh uh conversations

[1713.659 - 1717.679] um let's see can you describe the

[1715.22 - 1720.5] investigator investigate investigatory

[1717.679 - 1723.44] Authority that FTC has in this case

[1720.5 - 1725.72] um yep so they can uh seek information

[1723.44 - 1727.279] reasonably relevant

[1725.72 - 1729.02] um now here's here's something that's

[1727.279 - 1732.86] interesting and this is again according

[1729.02 - 1735.02] to Claude not an expert but uh the FTC

[1732.86 - 1737.1399999999999] is more concerned about operations and

[1735.02 - 1741.26] procedures rather than the data itself

[1737.14 - 1742.94] and so uh while while they do want to

[1741.26 - 1745.1589999999999] understand like

[1742.94 - 1747.2] um you know basically how it how it

[1745.159 - 1750.0800000000002] trains its models and where it gets its

[1747.2 - 1752.48] data they're more concerned about how

[1750.08 - 1755.539] that data is then used is it a violation

[1752.48 - 1758.419] of privacy and what lengths they go to

[1755.539 - 1760.34] to ensure that they are playing above

[1758.419 - 1762.38] board because again as a regulator

[1760.34 - 1764.899] they're not they're not saying like oh

[1762.38 - 1766.3400000000001] you hurt someone they're this is a more

[1764.899 - 1769.2199999999998] proactive thing

[1766.34 - 1771.4399999999998] so FDC cannot violate attorney-client

[1769.22 - 1772.94] privilege FTC is supposed to minimize

[1771.44 - 1775.52] burdens on the company by negotiating

[1772.94 - 1777.679] scope of requests open AI could raise

[1775.52 - 1780.9189999999999] undue burden concerns

[1777.679 - 1783.74] um about producing uh enormous data sets

[1780.919 - 1786.5] and they can they can also open AI can

[1783.74 - 1787.82] petition to set aside or modified any of

[1786.5 - 1791.419] the requests so basically it's going to

[1787.82 - 1793.9399999999998] be a negotiation between openai and the

[1791.419 - 1797.419] FTC and if they need to they might get a

[1793.94 - 1800.419] a judge involved but honestly just

[1797.419 - 1801.6200000000001] because the FTC is a federal agency I

[1800.419 - 1803.14] suspect they're probably going to

[1801.62 - 1805.9399999999998] negotiate directly

[1803.14 - 1808.7] again completely uneducated I don't know

[1805.94 - 1809.6000000000001] if that's actually how how it proceeds

[1808.7 - 1813.679] um

[1809.6 - 1815.059] yep so uh and then I I verified my my

[1813.679 - 1816.3200000000002] understanding that it's more about

[1815.059 - 1818.6] procedures

[1816.32 - 1820.7] um they so yes the document seeks uh

[1818.6 - 1822.86] policies processes assessments reports

[1820.7 - 1825.74] and aggregate consumer complaints rather

[1822.86 - 1827.539] than raw data so the FTC is probably not

[1825.74 - 1830.0] going to be looking like combing through

[1827.539 - 1831.799] the training data or the user data but

[1830.0 - 1833.14] they do want to see okay what do you do

[1831.799 - 1835.7] with this and having been through

[1833.14 - 1837.74] sarbanes-oxley audits before which is

[1835.7 - 1839.96] more about financial compliance I will

[1837.74 - 1841.039] say that yeah like if an auditor they

[1839.96 - 1842.3600000000001] don't really they're not going to look

[1841.039 - 1845.059] at the emails they just want to know

[1842.36 - 1846.74] like is your email server secure what

[1845.059 - 1848.899] are you doing to investigate spam and

[1846.74 - 1851.24] phishing stuff so it's more of a process

[1848.899 - 1854.059] and procedure kind of thing and then

[1851.24 - 1858.5] finally it uh oh I asked about like okay

[1854.059 - 1861.08] if the FTC finds uh like finds fault

[1858.5 - 1862.58] what can they do so civil penalties the

[1861.08 - 1865.46] FTC can find them they can do

[1862.58 - 1867.32] injunctions which basically says like

[1865.46 - 1868.64] um stop saying that you're not allowed

[1867.32 - 1872.24] to say it that way

[1868.64 - 1874.94] uh like if like basically if the FTC

[1872.24 - 1876.919] concludes that openai did misrepresent

[1874.94 - 1878.659] their security practices or the model

[1876.919 - 1881.2990000000002] capabilities or the training stuff they

[1878.659 - 1883.3990000000001] might say you know hey you you're not

[1881.299 - 1885.3799999999999] allowed to say that uh because we have

[1883.399 - 1886.82] deemed that that is factually incorrect

[1885.38 - 1888.98] and we disagree with that

[1886.82 - 1890.4189999999999] characterization uh some corrective

[1888.98 - 1892.82] actions and this is what I think is

[1890.419 - 1894.8600000000001] honestly going to be most likely is that

[1892.82 - 1896.48] basically if the FTC says that like hey

[1894.86 - 1898.8799999999999] you're not handling data and privacy

[1896.48 - 1900.8600000000001] correctly you need to go fix that so

[1898.88 - 1903.98] rather than finding them they might just

[1900.86 - 1906.74] say like hey you need to do better now

[1903.98 - 1909.26] with that being said given how open AI

[1906.74 - 1911.6] has quickly uh kind of shaped up

[1909.26 - 1913.46] whenever there's been a problem I think

[1911.6 - 1915.6789999999999] that they're gonna I I personally think

[1913.46 - 1917.72] that open AI is going to have a good

[1915.679 - 1919.46] enough uh case that they have done their

[1917.72 - 1921.02] due diligence and they have made good

[1919.46 - 1924.279] faith efforts

[1921.02 - 1926.779] um in order to uh you know

[1924.279 - 1929.059] abide by their Duty

[1926.779 - 1930.98] um at least at least in some cases not

[1929.059 - 1933.02] in all cases but at least when it comes

[1930.98 - 1935.0] to like data breaches and stuff because

[1933.02 - 1935.899] the FDC understands that data breaches

[1935.0 - 1938.24] happen

[1935.899 - 1940.9399999999998] and that and that you might accidentally

[1938.24 - 1943.039] mishandle data but as long as you have

[1940.94 - 1946.1000000000001] uh proper internal investigation

[1943.039 - 1948.44] procedures and that you have uh you know

[1946.1 - 1951.559] done done your due diligence

[1948.44 - 1954.26] um it might be able to uh kind of toss

[1951.559 - 1956.059] it and so here it's like okay uh it's

[1954.26 - 1957.62] entirely possible that the FTC finishes

[1956.059 - 1959.84] its investigation and concludes opening

[1957.62 - 1961.6999999999998] I did not violate any laws

[1959.84 - 1963.74] um so like that that is a completely

[1961.7 - 1966.32] legitimate outcome

[1963.74 - 1967.76] um you know if if here's another thing

[1966.32 - 1969.5] if opening eye can demonstrate that it

[1967.76 - 1971.84] made good faith efforts uh to comply

[1969.5 - 1974.0] with laws and norms and addresses any

[1971.84 - 1975.5] problems that it arose FTC would likely

[1974.0 - 1978.86] pursue collaborative remedies rather

[1975.5 - 1980.899] than punitive measures so basically this

[1978.86 - 1983.059] is going to be a learning

[1980.899 - 1985.8799999999999] um opportunity for both sides because

[1983.059 - 1987.32] open AI is a small company and it was it

[1985.88 - 1990.8600000000001] started as a research company and now

[1987.32 - 1993.74] it's for-profit and for anyone who has

[1990.86 - 1996.9189999999999] interacted with open AI versus Microsoft

[1993.74 - 1999.44] versus Nvidia versus IBM open AI has not

[1996.919 - 2001.179] been the best vendor because they they

[1999.44 - 2002.8600000000001] had to make that hard pivot from being a

[2001.179 - 2004.3600000000001] research organization to a for-profit

[2002.86 - 2006.039] organization and I know they're

[2004.36 - 2007.84] technically a cap profit organization

[2006.039 - 2010.059] but whatever

[2007.84 - 2011.98] um the fact of the matter is they went

[2010.059 - 2013.299] from Pure research to now they are a

[2011.98 - 2016.659] commercial entity

[2013.299 - 2019.059] and so part of that is they needed to

[2016.659 - 2020.5590000000002] hire the right people to understand how

[2019.059 - 2022.539] to run their I.T infrastructure

[2020.559 - 2025.12] correctly how how to design their

[2022.539 - 2027.1589999999999] software architectures to protect uh

[2025.12 - 2029.86] privacy and that sort of stuff now

[2027.159 - 2033.519] the the fundamental question here is

[2029.86 - 2035.5] good faith versus gross negligence did

[2033.519 - 2039.22] open AI

[2035.5 - 2041.2] um always act in good faith and and with

[2039.22 - 2043.059] above-board intentions even if they made

[2041.2 - 2046.72] mistakes or

[2043.059 - 2049.179] did they uh really drop the ball or did

[2046.72 - 2051.419] they willfully or deliberately

[2049.179 - 2054.04] um kind of skirt Norms or whatever

[2051.419 - 2056.2] that's really kind of what the FTC is

[2054.04 - 2058.54] going to be looking for here is uh you

[2056.2 - 2061.72] know and again I suspect there probably

[2058.54 - 2064.0] has been honest mistakes and open AI has

[2061.72 - 2065.919] demonstrated plenty of energy in my

[2064.0 - 2069.22] opinion to correct some of those honest

[2065.919 - 2071.56] mistakes but then the the depth of this

[2069.22 - 2073.5989999999997] investigation if there is any negligent

[2071.56 - 2075.7] wrongdoing I think the FTC is going to

[2073.599 - 2077.7400000000002] find it now the most interesting thing

[2075.7 - 2079.7799999999997] that I think is going to happen

[2077.74 - 2082.72] is that all three of these

[2079.78 - 2086.2000000000003] investigations are uh are happening at

[2082.72 - 2089.2599999999998] the same time and so the Precedence set

[2086.2 - 2091.0] by whatever the FTC finds could lend

[2089.26 - 2093.2200000000003] Credence or take the wind out of the

[2091.0 - 2095.619] sales of these other ones

[2093.22 - 2098.5] um but these kinds of class action uh

[2095.619 - 2100.7200000000003] complaints and these kinds of FDC

[2098.5 - 2103.18] investigations take months and months

[2100.72 - 2105.8199999999997] and months and I suspect they're

[2103.18 - 2107.9199999999996] probably all going to go away quietly

[2105.82 - 2111.76] um they're probably going to settle uh

[2107.92 - 2114.46] if if there is any kind of legitimacy to

[2111.76 - 2117.4] it but according to my lawyer friend

[2114.46 - 2119.26] like uh just on the defense side you're

[2117.4 - 2121.42] looking at months and months worth of

[2119.26 - 2124.0600000000004] Investigation to

[2121.42 - 2125.7400000000002] um to you know pull together documents

[2124.06 - 2127.9] to do the investigation to go back and

[2125.74 - 2129.5789999999997] forth with the courts so we're not

[2127.9 - 2131.8] probably going to see any movement on

[2129.579 - 2134.26] any of this anytime soon but the fact

[2131.8 - 2137.02] that it's like we've got this uh you

[2134.26 - 2138.579] know this rhyming triplet of complaints

[2137.02 - 2140.92] that are very similar and have some

[2138.579 - 2143.619] overlap between them is really

[2140.92 - 2145.3] interesting I'm not personally gonna you

[2143.619 - 2146.98] know say like open AI is about to

[2145.3 - 2149.32] implode like that's not gonna happen

[2146.98 - 2151.599] this is just ordinary

[2149.32 - 2152.8590000000004] um as far as I can tell having watched

[2151.599 - 2155.56] everything from the red hat and

[2152.859 - 2157.5989999999997] Microsoft uh Anti-Trust lawsuits back in

[2155.56 - 2159.2799999999997] the late 90s early 2000s whenever it was

[2157.599 - 2161.1400000000003] that they finished

[2159.28 - 2164.1400000000003] um this is pretty much run-of-the-mill

[2161.14 - 2165.5789999999997] again success breeds litigation the more

[2164.14 - 2167.44] successful you are the bigger of a

[2165.579 - 2171.28] Target you have on your back

[2167.44 - 2172.96] um now uh what I will say is while I am

[2171.28 - 2175.599] not the biggest fan of some of the

[2172.96 - 2178.2400000000002] decisions that openai has made I agree

[2175.599 - 2181.2400000000002] with much of what Sam Altman says and I

[2178.24 - 2182.859] think that he uh means well I think he

[2181.24 - 2184.359] has good intentions

[2182.859 - 2186.7599999999998] um even if I disagree on execution

[2184.359 - 2190.06] sometimes and so I think that I think

[2186.76 - 2191.6800000000003] that he will probably lead open AI to

[2190.06 - 2193.119] say like yeah like let's cooperate with

[2191.68 - 2194.5] the FTC to make sure that we are

[2193.119 - 2197.5] compliant

[2194.5 - 2200.079] um let's let's demonstrate that we did

[2197.5 - 2202.96] did right by our our customers and our

[2200.079 - 2204.94] training data now it remains to be seen

[2202.96 - 2206.8] some of this stuff will probably not

[2204.94 - 2210.28] even come out in Discovery again because

[2206.8 - 2212.7400000000002] uh open AI as far as I know has rights

[2210.28 - 2214.8390000000004] to protect their Trade Secrets which

[2212.74 - 2216.2799999999997] means that they can ask to say hey let's

[2214.839 - 2218.32] exclude this from the data set let's

[2216.28 - 2220.42] keep it off the Record let's keep it off

[2218.32 - 2223.0] the filings that sort of thing time will

[2220.42 - 2224.8] tell uh but yes so thanks for watching I

[2223.0 - 2227.16] hope you got a lot out of this

[2224.8 - 2230.26] um also just taking a step back

[2227.16 - 2232.359] recognizing that like hey I just put

[2230.26 - 2235.1800000000003] like three lawsuits or investigations

[2232.359 - 2237.64] rather into Claude and one of them was

[2235.18 - 2239.3799999999997] 157 pages long and I had a brief

[2237.64 - 2242.2] conversation to make sure that I

[2239.38 - 2244.599] understand it like this is incredible

[2242.2 - 2247.06] um this is this is a really Next Level

[2244.599 - 2248.5] technology and we're only seeing the

[2247.06 - 2250.359] beginning of it because again Claude is

[2248.5 - 2252.04] a hundred thousand tokens but the

[2250.359 - 2254.14] Microsoft longnet paper just came out

[2252.04 - 2255.94] with a billion tokens so imagine that

[2254.14 - 2257.92] instead of reading just one class action

[2255.94 - 2259.839] lawsuit you can read literally every

[2257.92 - 2262.119] class action lawsuit in the entire

[2259.839 - 2263.44] history of the planet that's what a

[2262.119 - 2265.2400000000002] billion tokens will allow you to do

[2263.44 - 2267.28] maybe maybe not quite every single class

[2265.24 - 2269.5] action lawsuit but certainly you could

[2267.28 - 2273.099] read a lot and that is part of the part

[2269.5 - 2274.78] of the the difficulty of uh of either

[2273.099 - 2276.7000000000003] filing these class action lawsuits or

[2274.78 - 2279.28] defending against them is that you have

[2276.7 - 2280.8999999999996] to look for so much precedent

[2279.28 - 2283.98] um anyways I'm starting to ramble so

[2280.9 - 2283.98] thanks for watching cheers
