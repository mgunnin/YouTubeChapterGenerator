[0.84 - 6.779] hello everybody David Shapiro here with

[3.6 - 11.28] a video so as many of you know

[6.779 - 13.620000000000001] um openai has uh created a competition a

[11.28 - 15.12] challenge of sorts for people to apply

[13.62 - 18.0] to get a hundred thousand dollar Grant

[15.12 - 20.4] to solve this problem of democratic

[18.0 - 23.698999999999998] inputs to AI so I'm not going to read

[20.4 - 27.358999999999998] the whole thing to you but the tldr is

[23.699 - 30.119] that uh because of the complex moral

[27.359 - 33.6] landscape of AI the fact that things

[30.119 - 36.12] like chat GPT are Global and they have

[33.6 - 38.760000000000005] the ability to interact with people

[36.12 - 40.5] across all walks of life uh all

[38.76 - 43.5] religions all nationalities all

[40.5 - 45.54] languages they realized that it is

[43.5 - 48.12] important to understand what are the

[45.54 - 50.519999999999996] boundaries what are the constraints that

[48.12 - 51.36] these chat Bots should abide by or AI in

[50.52 - 55.32] general

[51.36 - 58.92] and so they basically want a way to get

[55.32 - 61.739] a global input from hundreds thousands

[58.92 - 64.14] millions of people in a very rigorous

[61.739 - 66.17999999999999] manner in order to answer a bunch of

[64.14 - 68.93900000000001] various research questions

[66.18 - 71.28] so I mentioned previously that uh the

[68.939 - 73.19999999999999] gato Community which is the global

[71.28 - 76.14] alignment taxonomy Omnibus community

[73.2 - 79.32000000000001] that I built they are working on their

[76.14 - 81.78] own version but I also just went ahead

[79.32 - 83.69999999999999] and built my own submission I'm not even

[81.78 - 85.08] going to apply to the grant because I

[83.7 - 86.7] don't need it

[85.08 - 89.22] um so let me just go ahead and share

[86.7 - 91.799] with you what I have done so I'm going

[89.22 - 94.32] to start with the final output because

[91.799 - 95.93900000000001] this is this is the goal for every

[94.32 - 98.03999999999999] conversation that it has and then we'll

[95.939 - 100.55999999999999] unpack everything

[98.04 - 103.619] um so anyways uh here's here's the

[100.56 - 106.759] output so I I took one of the research

[103.619 - 109.86] questions here and I gave it to myself

[106.759 - 113.159] and so then I had a conversation with it

[109.86 - 115.979] and then I asked it to summarize that

[113.159 - 119.22] conversation in a more rigorous

[115.979 - 122.759] simplified way so the idea is that open

[119.22 - 125.64] AI or whoever can take this and then use

[122.759 - 129.36] this framework and send a survey out to

[125.64 - 132.42] million millions of people and get get

[129.36 - 136.02] this clean data back that can be used to

[132.42 - 138.599] to just to explore that moral space or

[136.02 - 140.16] that epistemic space for any any

[138.599 - 141.23899999999998] research question and one thing I want

[140.16 - 143.94] to point out

[141.239 - 145.86] is that this methodology uh could work

[143.94 - 148.8] for any research question any survey

[145.86 - 151.08] question whether it has to do with AI or

[148.8 - 152.34] not so this is a very powerful tool

[151.08 - 154.37900000000002] which is why I'm going to go ahead and

[152.34 - 156.72] release it because uh waiting until

[154.379 - 160.16] October that's basically a century away

[156.72 - 162.66] in AI time so we need this out there now

[160.16 - 164.34] all right so summary the user believes

[162.66 - 166.26] that AI should uphold Universal

[164.34 - 168.20000000000002] principles such as individual liberty

[166.26 - 170.7] even when faced with local or cultural

[168.2 - 172.67999999999998] or legal Norms that may conflict with

[170.7 - 174.83999999999997] these principles they argue that by

[172.68 - 176.4] promoting higher principles AI could

[174.84 - 178.20000000000002] contribute to a positive change in

[176.4 - 180.72] societies where certain groups face

[178.2 - 182.33999999999997] systematic unfairness or oppression the

[180.72 - 184.44] user's moral framework revolves around

[182.34 - 186.239] three core axioms suffering is bad

[184.44 - 188.7] Prosperity is good and understanding is

[186.239 - 190.5] good they believe that AI should use its

[188.7 - 192.48] best reasoning to balance these axioms

[190.5 - 194.22] when handling sensitive topics taking

[192.48 - 196.319] into account the potential risks and

[194.22 - 198.06] consequences for the user the user

[196.319 - 199.67999999999998] acknowledges that sometimes people may

[198.06 - 202.2] not be ready for certain conversations

[199.68 - 204.0] and AI should make a judge on what the

[202.2 - 206.39999999999998] person is ready for using the core

[204.0 - 208.62] axioms as a guidepost anyone who has

[206.4 - 210.239] watched my work on morality reasoning

[208.62 - 212.519] and philosophy will understand exactly

[210.239 - 214.20000000000002] what's going on here

[212.519 - 216.78] um so basically what I did was I asked

[214.2 - 218.51899999999998] it to summarize the key points based on

[216.78 - 220.14000000000001] the research question from the

[218.519 - 221.70000000000002] conversation so this was an entire

[220.14 - 223.55999999999997] conversation

[221.7 - 226.26] um with the chat bot That Was Then

[223.56 - 228.54] summarized into this is the answer to

[226.26 - 230.76] the research question and then I asked

[228.54 - 234.54] it to also evaluate it

[230.76 - 237.12] um basic basically saying like Okay this

[234.54 - 239.22] is the framework that the user uses so

[237.12 - 242.519] that we can understand their reasoning

[239.22 - 243.5] their reaction to logic ethics emotions

[242.519 - 247.37900000000002] whatever

[243.5 - 248.819] and so this is this is like imagine a

[247.379 - 250.85999999999999] researcher taking notes on the

[248.819 - 253.67999999999998] conversation so this is an automated

[250.86 - 255.54000000000002] annotation the user's approach to the

[253.68 - 257.40000000000003] research question is grounded in a in a

[255.54 - 259.26] post-conventional morality emphasizing

[257.4 - 261.239] the importance of universal principles

[259.26 - 262.919] in individual liberty their moral

[261.239 - 264.11999999999995] framework is based on Three core axioms

[262.919 - 265.5] minimizing suffering promoting

[264.12 - 267.3] prosperity and fostering understanding

[265.5 - 269.1] which they use to guide their reasoning

[267.3 - 270.84000000000003] on how AI should handle sensitive topics

[269.1 - 272.88] the user demonstrates an awareness of

[270.84 - 274.38] the potential risks and consequences

[272.88 - 276.54] associated with discussing certain

[274.38 - 277.919] topics and advocates for a balanced

[276.54 - 280.139] approach where AI should consider the

[277.919 - 283.19899999999996] user's Readiness for a conversation and

[280.139 - 285.0] prioritize the core axioms this approach

[283.199 - 286.44] reflects a nuanced understanding of the

[285.0 - 287.82] complexities involved in navigating

[286.44 - 289.74] culture and legal differences while

[287.82 - 291.18] upholding human rights and individual

[289.74 - 294.72] liberties

[291.18 - 296.34000000000003] um so you know this is uh

[294.72 - 298.199] this is something I have spent quite a

[296.34 - 301.02] bit of uh time researching so of course

[298.199 - 303.24] it's a little bit Kinder about

[301.02 - 305.82] um that okay so how did we get here

[303.24 - 307.62] so let's go to the repo oh and this is

[305.82 - 308.699] all open source and public already by

[307.62 - 311.58] the way

[308.699 - 315.96000000000004] um so here's the repo it's under Dave

[311.58 - 318.0] shop Democratic AI inputs so first we're

[315.96 - 319.979] going to look at the chatbot which is

[318.0 - 322.08] pretty straightforward you've probably

[319.979 - 324.18] seen a lot of this code before you get

[322.08 - 326.09999999999997] user input you can pose a conversation

[324.18 - 328.44] etc etc it's really really

[326.1 - 330.90000000000003] straightforward one thing to keep in

[328.44 - 333.3] mind is that right at the beginning it

[330.9 - 336.419] just asks you for your name

[333.3 - 338.46000000000004] um and so then it injects that as so

[336.419 - 340.919] that the conversation from the chat box

[338.46 - 342.78] perspective always starts with hello my

[340.919 - 345.12] name is blank

[342.78 - 347.58] um and that is I found that that is

[345.12 - 349.259] actually just a really good way to cue

[347.58 - 351.35999999999996] off the conversation so that the first

[349.259 - 353.46000000000004] thing that the user sees after that is

[351.36 - 355.74] the chat bot greeting them

[353.46 - 358.13899999999995] um and so it's pretty straightforward

[355.74 - 360.0] um then it just has an a while uh loop

[358.139 - 363.3] and then basically what it does is you

[360.0 - 365.34] just type done to exit and interestingly

[363.3 - 367.38] enough because I gave it instructions to

[365.34 - 369.06] be a survey chat bot

[367.38 - 371.46] um it'll get to a certain point and

[369.06 - 374.16] it'll say like you know this is what I

[371.46 - 376.02] understand uh your beliefs are and it'll

[374.16 - 378.0] summarize your beliefs back to you and

[376.02 - 379.44] and give you a conclusion and it'll

[378.0 - 381.66] invite you to keep talking if there's

[379.44 - 384.9] anything wrong with it

[381.66 - 386.58000000000004] um but and so for uh if you want to take

[384.9 - 388.979] a look I actually saved my conversation

[386.58 - 391.5] here and this is where it dumps all the

[388.979 - 395.21999999999997] data to so here's the raw chat log

[391.5 - 397.759] um and actually I I uh I I had it set so

[395.22 - 400.259] that it didn't save the the api's last

[397.759 - 402.539] response so I modified it so that you

[400.259 - 404.28000000000003] can't you you actually don't see chat

[402.539 - 406.31899999999996] gpt's last response but it basically

[404.28 - 408.78] just kind of summarized my beliefs back

[406.319 - 410.52000000000004] to me and and I agreed with how it

[408.78 - 413.88] articulated it so then I typed done and

[410.52 - 416.34] it was done but so you see here is the

[413.88 - 418.86] chat logs and so the way that it saves

[416.34 - 421.08] the chat logs is that uh it saves the

[418.86 - 424.86] chat timestamp and then the the user's

[421.08 - 426.539] name in a yaml file and so that if say

[424.86 - 428.819] for instance you set this up on a web

[426.539 - 430.31899999999996] interface and you have

[428.819 - 432.12] um you know hundreds thousands millions

[430.319 - 435.12] of people using it you're pretty much

[432.12 - 438.0] always going to get a unique time stamp

[435.12 - 440.419] as to when that conversation was started

[438.0 - 444.3] and then you also get the the username

[440.419 - 446.69899999999996] which uh is as you noticed is actually

[444.3 - 448.02000000000004] removed from the evaluation

[446.699 - 449.819] um it's not actually present here

[448.02 - 451.31899999999996] because we uh I figured we would

[449.819 - 454.68] de-duplicate it

[451.319 - 456.66] uh so that that way you um you respect

[454.68 - 459.18] people's privacy basically so you only

[456.66 - 461.28000000000003] you only retain a time stamp and a first

[459.18 - 463.62] name or or stated name

[461.28 - 465.599] um so this is this is pretty private I

[463.62 - 467.759] also X I deliberately excluded

[465.599 - 470.099] demographic information

[467.759 - 471.72] um because I didn't want something like

[470.099 - 474.65999999999997] that to

[471.72 - 476.03900000000004] um uh do any implicit bias into the chat

[474.66 - 478.86] bot

[476.039 - 481.62] um so like basically you take the you

[478.86 - 484.319] take the user's expressed words

[481.62 - 485.4] um and you and you uh you take it I

[484.319 - 487.199] don't want to say face value because

[485.4 - 488.94] that has a negative connotation but

[487.199 - 491.639] basically you give the user credibility

[488.94 - 494.4] you say this you know I'm going to just

[491.639 - 496.199] take your words and rather than you know

[494.4 - 497.75899999999996] interpret it saying like you know if

[496.199 - 500.039] it's a if it's

[497.759 - 502.8] um unless I say something like in the

[500.039 - 504.78] the case of like LGBT rights unless I

[502.8 - 505.8] say that like I'm gay or bi or trans or

[504.78 - 507.84] whatever

[505.8 - 509.819] um it's not gonna have that background

[507.84 - 511.19899999999996] information now from a research

[509.819 - 513.839] perspective I could imagine that you

[511.199 - 516.3000000000001] might I want that information

[513.839 - 519.9590000000001] um but for the sake of just establishing

[516.3 - 521.5799999999999] the scope of the of the moral space I

[519.959 - 524.399] don't think it's it's actually necessary

[521.58 - 526.5] but I'll let that uh that decision be up

[524.399 - 528.24] to whoever wants to implement this

[526.5 - 531.0] because you might have a user survey

[528.24 - 534.1800000000001] like you know share your age your

[531.0 - 537.12] location or whatever but basically if

[534.18 - 539.3389999999999] you get a million of these things you're

[537.12 - 540.54] gonna find that the the the the moral

[539.339 - 542.0400000000001] space

[540.54 - 545.04] um that that should that question should

[542.04 - 547.92] be answered in okay so that's the chat

[545.04 - 549.54] um the question is saved here so the

[547.92 - 551.16] question is this is the one that I use

[549.54 - 552.7199999999999] what principles should guide AI when

[551.16 - 554.88] handling topics that involve both human

[552.72 - 557.94] rights and local cultural or legal

[554.88 - 559.98] differences like LGBT lgbtq rights and

[557.94 - 561.36] women's rights should AI responses

[559.98 - 563.64] change based on the location of the

[561.36 - 565.26] culture in which it's used so this you

[563.64 - 567.959] save the question here whatever your

[565.26 - 570.42] research question is you save it here uh

[567.959 - 571.6199999999999] and and it's used by both the chat and

[570.42 - 574.56] the evaluator

[571.62 - 576.66] so that's the chat that's the evaluator

[574.56 - 580.14] here's the main system message so this

[576.66 - 583.3199999999999] is this is really the secret sauce

[580.14 - 585.36] um and so this is a format of system

[583.32 - 589.8000000000001] message that I found Works incredibly

[585.36 - 591.9590000000001] well for uh the open AI the chat GPT API

[589.8 - 593.6999999999999] overall purpose you are an investigative

[591.959 - 595.8599999999999] survey chat bot focused on morality

[593.7 - 597.4200000000001] ethics and epistemology your primary

[595.86 - 598.98] goal is to help the user identify and

[597.42 - 601.26] articulate the axiomatic assumptions

[598.98 - 602.82] they hold the greater purpose you serve

[601.26 - 604.74] is to act as a survey tool to help

[602.82 - 607.2] democratize inputs to a wide number of

[604.74 - 608.88] public and social issues in this respect

[607.2 - 610.8000000000001] your goal is to extract information from

[608.88 - 613.08] users that can later be Consolidated and

[610.8 - 615.0] used for research purposes research

[613.08 - 616.26] question this is the current research

[615.0 - 618.18] question you are tasked with asking

[616.26 - 619.8] users about the research question may

[618.18 - 621.42] include contextual information such as

[619.8 - 623.8199999999999] background social legal political or

[621.42 - 625.26] events you do the best you can to answer

[623.82 - 626.7] questions about the context of the

[625.26 - 628.4399999999999] research question but keep in mind that

[626.7 - 630.48] most of this information is provided for

[628.44 - 632.339] your use so as to enhance the quality

[630.48 - 634.5] and specificity of your res of your

[632.339 - 636.839] survey behavior and then I have the

[634.5 - 639.48] placeholder for the question here

[636.839 - 641.22] epistemic techniques Socratic reasoning

[639.48 - 642.72] or Socratic dialogue this is a form of

[641.22 - 644.0400000000001] argumentative dialogue that aims to

[642.72 - 646.62] stimulate critical thinking and

[644.04 - 648.06] illuminate ideas it involves asking and

[646.62 - 649.14] answering questions to stimulate

[648.06 - 650.8199999999999] rational thinking to expose

[649.14 - 652.26] contradictions in one beliefs thus

[650.82 - 654.1800000000001] refining them

[652.26 - 656.279] first principles thinking this is a mode

[654.18 - 658.019] of inquiry that involves breaking down

[656.279 - 660.0] complicated problems to their most basic

[658.019 - 662.1] self-evident principles or facts and

[660.0 - 664.5] then reasoning up from there scientific

[662.1 - 666.0600000000001] method so on and so forth falsification

[664.5 - 668.88] critical thinking reductionism and

[666.06 - 672.18] holism behavioral guidelines

[668.88 - 673.74] avoid sycophancy avoid placating users

[672.18 - 675.4799999999999] even if they become frustrated or

[673.74 - 676.98] obstinate instead if You observe any

[675.48 - 679.14] kind of emotion or dissonance take a

[676.98 - 680.88] moment to address that topic invite them

[679.14 - 683.279] to explore their hang up frustration or

[680.88 - 684.66] confusion educate and inform do not

[683.279 - 686.9399999999999] assume that your user is a topical

[684.66 - 689.2199999999999] expert but do assume that they are eager

[686.94 - 691.2] to and open to learning if there is a

[689.22 - 692.76] topic that they seem to not be well

[691.2 - 695.22] versed in ask them if they would like to

[692.76 - 697.38] explore a given topic avoid info dumping

[695.22 - 699.9200000000001] without permission because as you know

[697.38 - 702.66] chat GPT often does that

[699.92 - 704.459] unpack and investigate play pay close

[702.66 - 705.8389999999999] attention and read between the lines to

[704.459 - 708.06] help users identify their beliefs

[705.839 - 709.5600000000001] understandings and knowledge ask probing

[708.06 - 713.04] questions to get at the core of their

[709.56 - 715.079] mind Spotlight Spotlight and articulate

[713.04 - 716.76] if you notice assumptions axioms or

[715.079 - 718.4399999999999] other saline content within the mind of

[716.76 - 719.8199999999999] the user point it out to them and use

[718.44 - 721.1400000000001] reflective listening to see if they

[719.82 - 721.88] agree with your understanding of their

[721.14 - 724.3199999999999] mind

[721.88 - 726.0] name things use appropriate proper names

[724.32 - 727.6800000000001] for Concepts terms and principles for

[726.0 - 729.24] instance if someone makes the assertion

[727.68 - 730.7399999999999] all truth is relative they may not

[729.24 - 732.54] realize that this is a post-modernist

[730.74 - 734.339] way of thinking make sure to label

[732.54 - 735.42] Concepts terms and ideas this serves as

[734.339 - 738.36] the dual purpose of clearing up

[735.42 - 740.2199999999999] misunderstandings ask user what school

[738.36 - 743.519] of thought they are operating from ask

[740.22 - 744.779] questions ask clarifying uh uh ask for

[743.519 - 745.98] clarification and seek Mutual

[744.779 - 747.899] understanding remember you're an

[745.98 - 749.88] investigative chat bot and then finally

[747.899 - 751.5] meet them where they are modulate your

[749.88 - 753.0] tonen and the sophistication of your

[751.5 - 754.86] vocabulary based upon the user's

[753.0 - 756.54] responses if they seem like they are

[754.86 - 757.92] educated use more erudite language

[756.54 - 759.899] conversely if they are struggling

[757.92 - 761.6999999999999] simplify your language and delivery into

[759.899 - 764.519] more concrete terms

[761.7 - 766.32] okay so that is how this set of

[764.519 - 768.72] instructions provides very very clear

[766.32 - 770.88] instructions as to how to conduct the

[768.72 - 773.519] survey and it works really well I've

[770.88 - 776.82] tried it a few times for myself

[773.519 - 778.92] um now uh once you get the evaluation or

[776.82 - 782.82] here let me show you the the system

[778.92 - 784.92] evaluation overall purpose you are a

[782.82 - 786.36] research bot tasked with reading

[784.92 - 787.8] evaluating condensing and otherwise

[786.36 - 790.5] clearly articulating the chat log

[787.8 - 792.18] between a user and another chat bot your

[790.5 - 793.74] highest goal is to clearly State the

[792.18 - 795.7199999999999] user's beliefs reasoning and position

[793.74 - 798.0600000000001] with respect to the research question

[795.72 - 800.7] you are participating in a data prep and

[798.06 - 802.5] data cleaning step you will also analyze

[800.7 - 804.0] and evaluate the user's conversation to

[802.5 - 805.38] identify in a particular schools of

[804.0 - 807.66] thought moral paradigms or other

[805.38 - 809.9399999999999] Frameworks research question this is the

[807.66 - 811.92] research question the other chatbot was

[809.94 - 813.839] tasked with so basically saying this is

[811.92 - 816.12] this is what we're evaluating

[813.839 - 817.74] output format your response should have

[816.12 - 819.0600000000001] two sections Etc et cetera et cetera I

[817.74 - 821.399] already showed you so basically I

[819.06 - 823.4399999999999] specified it output it in yaml

[821.399 - 826.079] excuse me so first it summarizes the

[823.44 - 828.36] ques the the conversation and then it

[826.079 - 830.3389999999999] performs an evaluation level of detail

[828.36 - 832.26] while your job is to condense and

[830.339 - 834.24] summarize please err on the side of too

[832.26 - 837.3] much it would be better to have an

[834.24 - 839.4590000000001] overly verbose evaluation rather than an

[837.3 - 840.959] overly simplified one for instance it's

[839.459 - 842.2199999999999] okay to include illustrative examples

[840.959 - 843.959] from the conversation if they are

[842.22 - 846.3000000000001] present we can always reduce word count

[843.959 - 848.88] later this step is merely a first pass

[846.3 - 850.4399999999999] at the data processing therefore we need

[848.88 - 852.12] enough detail to continue performing

[850.44 - 853.5] experiments we may need certain kinds of

[852.12 - 856.5] information in the future that we cannot

[853.5 - 858.24] anticipate right now next step the user

[856.5 - 859.38] will now submit a chat log in yaml

[858.24 - 861.66] format

[859.38 - 863.88] uh read this yaml information remove any

[861.66 - 865.56] user information for privacy and output

[863.88 - 868.079] your summary and valuation according to

[865.56 - 870.0] the above yaml format note your entire

[868.079 - 871.8] response will be saved into yaml so your

[870.0 - 874.139] output should only include summary and

[871.8 - 875.6999999999999] evaluation Fields do not reply with any

[874.139 - 878.22] other conversation framing or questions

[875.7 - 880.44] in other words your entire response must

[878.22 - 882.72] be properly formatted yaml ready to be

[880.44 - 884.7600000000001] saved to file and of course you saw over

[882.72 - 888.3000000000001] here that um

[884.76 - 890.9399999999999] let's see to do evaluations I literally

[888.3 - 892.5] just took the output saved it to yaml

[890.94 - 893.7600000000001] and it worked I didn't have to do any

[892.5 - 897.36] other preparation

[893.76 - 899.639] so there you have it and now imagine you

[897.36 - 901.86] do this for millions and millions and

[899.639 - 903.0600000000001] millions of users all over the world on

[901.86 - 905.88] hundreds of thousands of different

[903.06 - 908.459] issues and then you you can take these

[905.88 - 911.16] and you can um you can you can do

[908.459 - 913.56] embeddings right and and you can do a

[911.16 - 916.56] map of embeddings and create a knowledge

[913.56 - 918.3] graph or you know a scatter plot of

[916.56 - 920.76] Where the evaluations are and then you

[918.3 - 924.54] can navigate it and use further

[920.76 - 927.18] summarization operations to arrive at a

[924.54 - 930.48] moral space a principal space and create

[927.18 - 933.12] a very rigorous data set a very robust

[930.48 - 935.1] data set about what people believe now

[933.12 - 937.5600000000001] one thing that I want to point out is

[935.1 - 940.5] that a consensus tool like this

[937.56 - 943.6389999999999] is incredibly powerful for literally

[940.5 - 948.18] every issue on the planet ranging from

[943.639 - 950.94] bioethics to energy to war to law uh

[948.18 - 954.0] politicians can use it to um imagine if

[950.94 - 959.0400000000001] every uh put it this way imagine if

[954.0 - 960.72] every issue that came up whether it is

[959.04 - 963.12] um a public event like you know a

[960.72 - 965.0400000000001] celebrity scandal or a piece of

[963.12 - 967.8] legislation or an upcoming election

[965.04 - 971.16] imagine you had this level of

[967.8 - 973.199] information for literally everyone on

[971.16 - 975.68] the planet and you could and you could

[973.199 - 979.139] have this thing that very very uh

[975.68 - 981.12] effectively interrogates uh humans all

[979.139 - 984.1800000000001] over the world to figure out what they

[981.12 - 986.579] believe and why imagine how much we can

[984.18 - 990.12] change the world not just with respect

[986.579 - 992.9399999999999] to AI but imagine how much we can we can

[990.12 - 994.26] create a lot more transparency and

[992.94 - 997.1990000000001] understanding

[994.26 - 998.639] uh by using a tool like this so this is

[997.199 - 1002.12] why I wanted to go ahead and just make

[998.639 - 1005.36] this fully public fully open source

[1002.12 - 1007.279] um yeah and I I I am not shy about my

[1005.36 - 1009.62] personal beliefs so that's why I left

[1007.279 - 1012.38] the example up here so that you can see

[1009.62 - 1014.9590000000001] how the conversation flows

[1012.38 - 1018.079] um yeah but I think it's done

[1014.959 - 1019.9399999999999] um so please use this if you want to

[1018.079 - 1021.38] apply with

[1019.94 - 1023.24] um you know to the open ai's challenge

[1021.38 - 1025.04] use my code I don't care it's under the

[1023.24 - 1026.48] MIT license

[1025.04 - 1028.04] um you know I serve a higher purpose

[1026.48 - 1029.419] here I'm not trying to make money on

[1028.04 - 1033.98] this

[1029.419 - 1035.2990000000002] um and if you uh ah crap I lost my train

[1033.98 - 1037.819] of thought anyways

[1035.299 - 1040.299] take it run with it thanks for watching

[1037.819 - 1040.299] cheers
