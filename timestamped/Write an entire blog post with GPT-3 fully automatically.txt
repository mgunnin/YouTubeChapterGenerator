[2.7 - 8.879999999999999] foreign

[5.18 - 12.36] here for a video so today we are going

[8.88 - 13.860000000000001] to do auto Muse blogger so rather than

[12.36 - 15.838999999999999] generating long format fiction we're

[13.86 - 18.358999999999998] going to generate blog posts now before

[15.839 - 20.58] we get started

[18.359 - 23.400000000000002] before we get started

[20.58 - 26.4] um I have to warn you that one this use

[23.4 - 28.259999999999998] case if you were to try and just do this

[26.4 - 30.299999999999997] and put it directly online that is

[28.26 - 31.859] against open ai's policies so don't do

[30.3 - 34.92] this this is for research purposes only

[31.859 - 37.559000000000005] now that being said you are allowed as

[34.92 - 39.719] far as I know you are allowed to use AI

[37.559 - 42.3] to generate content as long as you then

[39.719 - 45.0] put human eyes on it to like edit it

[42.3 - 47.57899999999999] clean it up make sure that it's safe and

[45.0 - 49.559] then also I think part of the EULA

[47.579 - 53.039] requires that you say this was written

[49.559 - 55.199] by AI I think obviously check with uh

[53.039 - 57.18] check with open AI before going live on

[55.199 - 59.16] any apps that do this kind of thing but

[57.18 - 60.96] that being said

[59.16 - 63.538999999999994] um lots and lots of folks have wanted

[60.96 - 66.0] blogs and I've just had this turning in

[63.539 - 69.42] the back of my head so we will uh we

[66.0 - 72.06] will take a stab at this now also

[69.42 - 74.58] um I posted a poll on YouTube and the

[72.06 - 75.9] results were overwhelming y'all want to

[74.58 - 78.42] have

[75.9 - 81.24000000000001] um fewer videos but higher quality

[78.42 - 83.34] videos it was overwhelming so

[81.24 - 84.89999999999999] um stay tuned this is going to be my

[83.34 - 87.54] first one where I'll do some editing

[84.9 - 89.04] after the fact and uh and we'll go from

[87.54 - 90.659] there because I've also got the chapters

[89.04 - 93.72] right I figured out how to automatically

[90.659 - 95.82000000000001] do chapters with uh with gpt3 all right

[93.72 - 96.84] so all that out of the way let's get

[95.82 - 98.82] started

[96.84 - 100.619] first

[98.82 - 101.88] um when I when I'm starting a project

[100.619 - 103.439] like this

[101.88 - 104.82] um what I've started doing is kind of

[103.439 - 107.75899999999999] brainstorming getting my thoughts out

[104.82 - 108.5] because then I have a template to follow

[107.759 - 111.18] um

[108.5 - 113.82] oftentimes you see me rely on intuition

[111.18 - 115.86000000000001] and intuition is good and it works much

[113.82 - 117.17999999999999] of the time but not always and plus it's

[115.86 - 119.1] also not something that I can just tell

[117.18 - 121.14] you like use your intuition so let's

[119.1 - 123.17999999999999] actually do a process so what we're

[121.14 - 124.74] going to do is just brainstorm okay what

[123.18 - 126.36000000000001] it what do we think this is actually

[124.74 - 128.22] going to do so first

[126.36 - 130.38] we're going to say take a prompt of some

[128.22 - 133.56] sort natural and natural language

[130.38 - 137.099] instructions like I want to blog about X

[133.56 - 139.31900000000002] um brainstorm the structure of the

[137.099 - 139.92] request so

[139.319 - 142.61999999999998] um

[139.92 - 144.35999999999999] if you just ask instruct series to write

[142.62 - 145.86] it'll start writing I mean gpt3

[144.36 - 148.86] generative pre-trained model is

[145.86 - 150.0] generative it will write but one thing

[148.86 - 153.3] that it doesn't do is it doesn't

[150.0 - 155.879] necessarily think about structure

[153.3 - 158.94] um and so given whatever the

[155.879 - 161.94] um the input is let's think about

[158.94 - 162.72] um the best way to do it uh So like

[161.94 - 166.739] um

[162.72 - 167.459] uh let's see like maybe list

[166.739 - 170.459] um

[167.459 - 173.04] a bunch of sections and then what we can

[170.459 - 177.72] do is we can probably

[173.04 - 181.379] iterate on that list to improve it

[177.72 - 182.76] um like is this a good list

[181.379 - 184.26] oops

[182.76 - 186.06] um okay so then once we have a list of

[184.26 - 189.239] sections

[186.06 - 191.099] um then we can say okay uh okay what

[189.239 - 192.59900000000002] after we have the sections then do we

[191.099 - 195.35999999999999] just start writing or do we do some

[192.599 - 197.819] research probably we'll do some research

[195.36 - 200.459] um uh let's see

[197.819 - 204.78] uh brainstorm

[200.459 - 208.94] um some interesting uh like some facts

[204.78 - 212.22] or points to include for each section

[208.94 - 214.44] yeah and then

[212.22 - 216.3] let's see

[214.44 - 218.34] and also we're gonna keep we're going to

[216.3 - 220.019] keep this in mind the whole time right

[218.34 - 222.72] so

[220.019 - 224.459] let's just bold that

[222.72 - 225.78] um okay so then we got some lists and

[224.459 - 227.459] points and then we actually want to

[225.78 - 231.48] write the thing

[227.459 - 234.12] um okay so then we'll write the actual

[231.48 - 239.57999999999998] sections

[234.12 - 242.04] um and then six uh iterate improve

[239.58 - 244.019] the sections and then

[242.04 - 247.62] done

[244.019 - 248.22] and I okay so that's where we'll start

[247.62 - 251.64000000000001] um

[248.22 - 254.22] I'm not going to dive into automatically

[251.64 - 256.739] pulling from external sources for this

[254.22 - 259.019] one for this we're going to start with

[256.739 - 260.94] something simple because gpt3 already

[259.019 - 262.079] knows a lot

[260.94 - 264.0] um but

[262.079 - 266.28000000000003] perhaps in a future version or a

[264.0 - 268.08] different kind of thing I might explore

[266.28 - 269.63899999999995] like an automatic Knowledge Graph

[268.08 - 270.84] Builder

[269.639 - 274.08] um because that's something I've wanted

[270.84 - 275.46] to do anyways but for for the for the

[274.08 - 277.25899999999996] sake of this one we're just going to

[275.46 - 279.65999999999997] assume that gpt3 already has the

[277.259 - 280.91900000000004] information built embedded in it

[279.66 - 282.96000000000004] somewhere because it's already read a

[280.919 - 284.94] lot of news and Reddit and Wikipedia and

[282.96 - 286.13899999999995] stuff so the topic that I was going to

[284.94 - 288.199] do

[286.139 - 291.36] um was going to be

[288.199 - 293.34000000000003] Shinto in Japan because I'm reading a

[291.36 - 295.08000000000004] book about Japanese history and culture

[293.34 - 297.0] so it's something that I happen to know

[295.08 - 299.34] a little bit about and of course like

[297.0 - 301.139] gpt3 has already read all of Wikipedia

[299.34 - 303.71999999999997] on all of these things so I'm going to

[301.139 - 304.68] assume that it has enough knowledge to

[303.72 - 306.96000000000004] do this

[304.68 - 310.979] so first thing we're going to do

[306.96 - 313.02] is we're going to go to the playground

[310.979 - 315.08] and we will say

[313.02 - 315.08] um

[315.419 - 319.02] so basically we're going to start with

[316.74 - 321.919] some prompt engineering

[319.02 - 325.46] I'll say um

[321.919 - 325.46] uh let's see

[326.22 - 330.78000000000003] um write a blog outline

[332.16 - 341.88000000000005] write a killer blog outline for the

[335.039 - 341.88] following request from a customer okay

[342.12 - 349.139] requests

[344.52 - 352.75899999999996] um I want a cool blog post

[349.139 - 354.96000000000004] about the history of

[352.759 - 359.58000000000004] Shinto and

[354.96 - 361.68] Corey gates in Japan like

[359.58 - 365.88] I'm basically adopting the percent of

[361.68 - 371.1] like a surfer bro like uh how did they

[365.88 - 371.82] come up with that idea what does it mean

[371.1 - 374.1] um

[371.82 - 377.82] and let's see and

[374.1 - 380.41900000000004] what are the coolest ones to see

[377.82 - 384.9] I'm going to Japan

[380.419 - 387.18] next summer because I'm a weeb sorry

[384.9 - 391.31899999999996] um I have a bunch of friends who are uh

[387.18 - 393.90000000000003] was it xenophile would be China what do

[391.319 - 396.06] you call it if someone is like an actual

[393.9 - 398.28] term if someone is obsessed with Japan

[396.06 - 399.66] they're into an anime and stuff I used

[398.28 - 401.34] to be in high school my my high school

[399.66 - 402.72] girlfriend got me into anime and I was

[401.34 - 404.81899999999996] into it for like 10 years and then I

[402.72 - 406.44000000000005] kind of like got over it

[404.819 - 409.38] I'm still a nerd I'm not trying to

[406.44 - 411.71999999999997] defend that okay write a killer blog uh

[409.38 - 413.58] outline for the following uh request

[411.72 - 415.91900000000004] from a customer all right so the request

[413.58 - 417.18] is this okay so now

[415.919 - 420.65999999999997] um

[417.18 - 423.419] brainstorm a list of sections for this

[420.66 - 424.5] blog post

[423.419 - 428.639] um

[424.5 - 430.56] each section uh let's see

[428.639 - 434.6] uh let's see

[430.56 - 439.639] the outline should meet the customers

[434.6 - 443.94] requests and each section should be

[439.639 - 447.56] let's say highly descriptive

[443.94 - 451.38] provide a paragraph

[447.56 - 455.16] explaining what should go

[451.38 - 457.02] should go into each section okay so then

[455.16 - 459.53900000000004] we'll do sections and we'll start with

[457.02 - 462.84] one so one thing that I do you'll notice

[459.539 - 466.02] uh often that I'll do all caps lock for

[462.84 - 467.81899999999996] for these things what that does it's

[466.02 - 469.85999999999996] very similar to what it does for humans

[467.819 - 471.3] so for humans it draws your eye to or

[469.86 - 472.699] you're like okay cool this is like a

[471.3 - 475.62] thing that I need to pay attention to

[472.699 - 477.96000000000004] but also it's a different set of tokens

[475.62 - 481.919] it's new it's represented differently

[477.96 - 483.539] inside of gpt3 which allows it to kind

[481.919 - 487.62] of notice oh this isn't just the word

[483.539 - 490.74] request this is capital r request okay

[487.62 - 494.419] so let's just let this run let's turn

[490.74 - 494.419] the token count up to a thousand

[497.639 - 502.319] and then it starts writing okay I don't

[499.379 - 505.879] want you to actually start writing it

[502.319 - 505.879] um so this isn't so good

[506.28 - 511.25899999999996] I want to actually give me like

[509.34 - 513.659] yeah not not just a table of contents

[511.259 - 514.86] but like describe each section so this

[513.659 - 516.7189999999999] is this is one thing that's really

[514.86 - 518.94] infuriating about

[516.719 - 521.399] um about the instructor series is that

[518.94 - 522.719] if you can tell if it was trained to do

[521.399 - 524.459] something like what you're asking it to

[522.719 - 526.44] do because it'll do it really well but

[524.459 - 528.2399999999999] if it wasn't it will just give you a

[526.44 - 529.62] table of contents and then start writing

[528.24 - 531.12] a thing

[529.62 - 534.62] um

[531.12 - 534.62] yeah actually

[538.2 - 541.7] I wonder if I confused it

[545.7 - 551.76] all right

[547.98 - 554.339] because like what is Shinto there we go

[551.76 - 555.8389999999999] how to inter incorporate tour Gates into

[554.339 - 559.08] your Japan trip

[555.839 - 560.7] that's not so bad okay so by I confused

[559.08 - 562.98] it when I said like add a paragraph

[560.7 - 566.1600000000001] because then it's like okay let's let's

[562.98 - 567.6] write out all these things and then yeah

[566.16 - 568.86] all right let's run this a couple times

[567.6 - 572.0600000000001] just to make sure that it's going to

[568.86 - 572.0600000000001] give me consistent Behavior

[572.399 - 575.279] the significance of tour Gates the

[573.959 - 577.4399999999999] different types of tour Gates the most

[575.279 - 579.36] famous story gates in Japan okay I think

[577.44 - 582.12] we're off to a good start so let's copy

[579.36 - 585.6800000000001] this as our first prompt

[582.12 - 585.68] um okay so we'll do

[586.86 - 589.519] request

[591.36 - 595.98] and then we'll do that so this we've got

[594.3 - 600.06] prompt

[595.98 - 600.0600000000001] um so this is going to be sections

[600.12 - 606.6] so let's see brainstorm the structure

[605.279 - 608.399] um take a list of bunch of sections

[606.6 - 609.839] iterate on that list to improve it is

[608.399 - 612.54] this a good list

[609.839 - 616.74] was I a good list you were the best list

[612.54 - 618.24] all right so what I mean by this is

[616.74 - 619.86] um lots of folks have started asking

[618.24 - 623.16] about like doing

[619.86 - 626.1] um like having gpt3 check itself to

[623.16 - 628.8] improve uh its own performance and I

[626.1 - 630.5400000000001] find that it can work really well not

[628.8 - 633.06] always

[630.54 - 636.48] um so let's just give let's take a stab

[633.06 - 640.1999999999999] at this let's copy this whole prompt out

[636.48 - 641.64] just for posterity's sake okay

[640.2 - 646.2] um

[641.64 - 651.3] I brainstormed the following list of

[646.2 - 655.62] blogs SEC of sections of a Blog

[651.3 - 659.06] um based on the customer's request

[655.62 - 662.339] um I need to uh

[659.06 - 666.54] uh um

[662.339 - 670.1400000000001] brainstorm to see if there's any

[666.54 - 674.04] there are any improvements they can make

[670.14 - 675.42] to this past uh

[674.04 - 678.12] uh

[675.42 - 680.64] I guess outline yeah that's the word I

[678.12 - 683.04] know words okay so then we'll do we'll

[680.64 - 684.899] copy the customer request and then we'll

[683.04 - 688.3199999999999] do outline

[684.899 - 690.98] and let's come back over here

[688.32 - 690.98] copy that

[692.16 - 700.019] all right and so then we'll do uh

[696.019 - 703.079] brainstorm let's see no brainstorm some

[700.019 - 705.899] possible improvements

[703.079 - 709.04] all right let's see what it does

[705.899 - 709.04] dad doesn't get it

[709.98 - 715.44] well maybe

[712.079 - 717.5] it added a list it added an item how to

[715.44 - 721.0200000000001] visit Tory Gates

[717.5 - 723.48] oh okay

[721.02 - 725.279] [Music]

[723.48 - 727.32] let's run that again see if it gives us

[725.279 - 729.959] what is Shinto okay

[727.32 - 730.69] tips for seeing tour Gates so it did add

[729.959 - 732.18] a section

[730.69 - 734.4590000000001] [Music]

[732.18 - 736.62] all right

[734.459 - 738.959] hmm

[736.62 - 742.7] I wonder what happens

[738.959 - 742.6999999999999] if we do this again

[743.16 - 746.9399999999999] okay

[744.3 - 748.3199999999999] what happens if we

[746.94 - 751.5790000000001] just

[748.32 - 751.5790000000001] regurgitate this

[754.32 - 758.4590000000001] Shinto festivals associated with tour

[756.3 - 761.779] Gates look at that okay

[758.459 - 764.8199999999999] so if we run this so this

[761.779 - 767.639] I'm at the point in my career with gpt3

[764.82 - 769.44] where like if my intuition generates a

[767.639 - 770.94] prompt that behaves correctly the first

[769.44 - 775.2] time I don't trust it

[770.94 - 777.6800000000001] because I'm like wait a second hmm is

[775.2 - 777.6800000000001] this an accident

[778.68 - 783.56] so then we'll say

[780.899 - 783.56] outline

[784.56 - 788.5189999999999] um but basically prompt

[787.62 - 791.279] um

[788.519 - 794.04] improve outline

[791.279 - 795.8389999999999] and we'll change the sections to outline

[794.04 - 799.26] because for whatever reason my brain did

[795.839 - 800.7600000000001] not helpfully supply the word outline

[799.26 - 804.12] because that's where you start when

[800.76 - 805.76] you're writing anything start an outline

[804.12 - 808.92] um

[805.76 - 810.8389999999999] uh yeah okay so then we'll take

[808.92 - 812.399] I keep leaning over because my camera my

[810.839 - 814.3800000000001] microphone's a little bit in the way so

[812.399 - 816.3] if the audio is a little bit worse I

[814.38 - 818.639] apologize but I want to not be leaning

[816.3 - 819.899] over the whole video

[818.639 - 821.339] okay

[819.899 - 824.04] let's just

[821.339 - 827.6] keep recycling this to see

[824.04 - 827.5999999999999] um see if it keeps improving

[829.2 - 833.12] frequently asked questions

[831.12 - 835.32] I wonder if it's just gonna keep adding

[833.12 - 838.44] sections because this is actually doing

[835.32 - 840.839] a good job of like what can we do to add

[838.44 - 842.94] to this

[840.839 - 845.94] so probably if if it keeps going

[842.94 - 848.8800000000001] indefinitely okay so now what we have

[845.94 - 852.0600000000001] done is is it has converged so what we

[848.88 - 854.1] can do is we'll just keep rerunning this

[852.06 - 855.8389999999999] um until until we get convergence which

[854.1 - 857.279] means that the input is the same as the

[855.839 - 858.36] output

[857.279 - 861.6] um okay

[858.36 - 865.019] so yep so that's good

[861.6 - 867.779] and what am I doing all right so improve

[865.019 - 870.0] outline and let's see keep it an editor

[867.779 - 871.92] no because I named it wrong so we've got

[870.0 - 873.24] the outline and then we've got improve

[871.92 - 876.1999999999999] outline

[873.24 - 876.2] and that's good

[877.8 - 880.399] okay

[881.519 - 888.199] yes

[882.839 - 888.1990000000001] I wonder will it break if I

[888.72 - 892.8000000000001] if I give it a number one that might

[890.94 - 894.839] prompt it

[892.8 - 898.26] to ensure that it will

[894.839 - 900.5400000000001] oh additional resources okay

[898.26 - 902.519] so one thing that you can do is you can

[900.54 - 904.98] kind of give it a clue as to what you

[902.519 - 907.26] want want it to look like and so that's

[904.98 - 909.3000000000001] what you do here where I have this this

[907.26 - 911.1] is just it's a clue it says give me a

[909.3 - 912.66] numbered list right I don't have to tell

[911.1 - 914.76] it to give me a numbered list I just

[912.66 - 917.3389999999999] give it a little tiny breadcrumb to say

[914.76 - 920.8199999999999] give me a numbered list

[917.339 - 923.22] um so I might do the same here just so

[920.82 - 925.1990000000001] that way because sometimes you might end

[923.22 - 926.639] up with something where it's like hey

[925.199 - 928.019] I'm going to come up with a completely

[926.639 - 929.4590000000001] new idea

[928.019 - 931.8] um but if you tell it what you want

[929.459 - 935.3389999999999] implicitly or explicitly so this is an

[931.8 - 937.8] implicit request of the machine so this

[935.339 - 939.839] might this might break it we'll have to

[937.8 - 941.9399999999999] after we run it we might um we might

[939.839 - 948.3000000000001] have to come back to this

[941.94 - 948.3000000000001] um okay let's go here okay request

[949.5 - 955.92] all right and then I think it's time to

[952.98 - 958.019] start coding actually

[955.92 - 960.36] um because what I like to do is before I

[958.019 - 964.38] get too far

[960.36 - 966.54] um actually no well hmm

[964.38 - 969.959] let me take a look at uh

[966.54 - 972.54] at the readme how far do we want to go

[969.959 - 974.6389999999999] okay so we got the iteration so we're

[972.54 - 976.92] already halfway done brainstorm some

[974.639 - 979.6800000000001] facts or points to include for each

[976.92 - 982.38] section okay so let's try this then

[979.68 - 984.779] let's try our hand at

[982.38 - 986.459] yada yada yada

[984.779 - 989.48] I wish I hadn't closed those other ones

[986.459 - 989.4799999999999] okay so given

[997.56 - 1004.7589999999999] ah let's see I have the following uh

[1001.639 - 1008.36] blog request to write

[1004.759 - 1009.74] um I am focusing on

[1008.36 - 1014.42] um

[1009.74 - 1015.74] writing one second at a time

[1014.42 - 1020.959] um

[1015.74 - 1025.4] or uh let's see I need to brainstorm uh

[1020.959 - 1030.02] no I need to jot down some notes about

[1025.4 - 1032.7800000000002] each section before I proceed now each

[1030.02 - 1036.079] section this section

[1032.78 - 1037.16] um this section before I proceed okay

[1036.079 - 1039.799] um

[1037.16 - 1042.26] section so then we'll just say what is

[1039.799 - 1044.12] Shinto

[1042.26 - 1046.72] and then we'll say

[1044.12 - 1046.7199999999998] um let's see

[1047.5 - 1056.419] here are my research notes on this

[1052.1 - 1057.32] section I need to write everything I

[1056.419 - 1062.5] know

[1057.32 - 1062.5] about this and let's see what it does

[1068.9 - 1071.38] okay

[1072.2 - 1076.22] here are my let's say let's let's see

[1074.48 - 1077.78] what happens we say detailed research

[1076.22 - 1080.679] notes

[1077.78 - 1080.6789999999999] there we go

[1081.2 - 1084.28] much better

[1089.66 - 1097.3400000000001] the yep you say Grand shrine

[1093.74 - 1099.02] god of the sun goddessama thratsu okay

[1097.34 - 1101.1789999999999] this is all in line with what I'm

[1099.02 - 1101.96] reading in my book so it looks like it

[1101.179 - 1103.64] is

[1101.96 - 1106.1000000000001] um this is actually one that I'm not

[1103.64 - 1107.9] sure I haven't read about that in the

[1106.1 - 1110.36] book but anyways so it does look like

[1107.9 - 1112.64] it's being accurate

[1110.36 - 1113.9599999999998] um although I wish this was a little bit

[1112.64 - 1117.26] more

[1113.96 - 1118.88] I do I like the the that it it seemed

[1117.26 - 1121.28] like it produced a little bit more when

[1118.88 - 1123.679] it was a list so what let's see if we

[1121.28 - 1126.7] give it a clue

[1123.679 - 1126.7] um yeah

[1127.1 - 1131.299] Shinto is the largest with over 100

[1128.66 - 1133.5800000000002] million follow your followers located in

[1131.299 - 1136.0] the city ize

[1133.58 - 1136.0] um first

[1138.38 - 1143.179] and then if we do this again

[1141.44 - 1144.799] um

[1143.179 - 1147.26] see but this isn't everything that you

[1144.799 - 1149.24] know right like I said I asked for

[1147.26 - 1151.58] detailed research notes I need to write

[1149.24 - 1153.98] everything I know and it gives me six

[1151.58 - 1155.24] bullet points

[1153.98 - 1157.16] really

[1155.24 - 1159.22] really

[1157.16 - 1159.22] um

[1161.299 - 1167.12] okay that's fine

[1164.84 - 1169.6] but one thing that's interesting is it

[1167.12 - 1169.6] seems like

[1169.76 - 1174.26] into means the way of the Gods it almost

[1172.34 - 1176.059] seems like I can just run it a few times

[1174.26 - 1179.48] and it will give me different outputs

[1176.059 - 1182.799] each time so maybe for this section we

[1179.48 - 1182.799] just run it a couple times

[1183.32 - 1186.7] actually this seems like it's working

[1184.46 - 1186.7] okay

[1191.419 - 1194.38] yeah okay

[1195.799 - 1201.5] all right so probably what we'll do is

[1198.38 - 1202.88] just break the sections down and then we

[1201.5 - 1205.76] will

[1202.88 - 1208.0390000000002] um we'll run this where we're asking for

[1205.76 - 1209.84] notes on each section we'll run it a

[1208.039 - 1212.6] couple times

[1209.84 - 1214.6999999999998] um to kind of get a little bit more out

[1212.6 - 1218.78] of it out of the machine

[1214.7 - 1221.6000000000001] um that seems like it's working okay-ish

[1218.78 - 1223.7] um okay so then we'll do request

[1221.6 - 1225.7099999999998] and then we'll do

[1223.7 - 1227.66] um section

[1225.71 - 1228.8600000000001] [Music]

[1227.66 - 1230.3600000000001] and then we'll just leave this

[1228.86 - 1233.4189999999999] open-ended so it might produce a

[1230.36 - 1237.1999999999998] paragraph it might produce a list okay

[1233.419 - 1239.72] so we'll do prompt research

[1237.2 - 1243.02] um actually here we'll do section

[1239.72 - 1245.3600000000001] research and so what this is doing just

[1243.02 - 1247.4] to take a step back and tell you like

[1245.36 - 1248.9599999999998] okay what is what is this actually doing

[1247.4 - 1251.48] so

[1248.96 - 1254.059] one misconception that people have is

[1251.48 - 1255.8600000000001] whether or not gpt3 is pulling from a

[1254.059 - 1258.5] database or searching the internet or

[1255.86 - 1261.3799999999999] what how is it how is it doing all this

[1258.5 - 1263.6] and so all this information is embedded

[1261.38 - 1266.48] in the neural network and so what we're

[1263.6 - 1268.82] doing is we're writing a prompt to pull

[1266.48 - 1269.6] that information out of the neural

[1268.82 - 1274.039] network

[1269.6 - 1276.799] and so the this works in a similar

[1274.039 - 1278.48] fashion to how human brains work and

[1276.799 - 1281.059] that our all of our knowledge and

[1278.48 - 1283.7] memories is implicit in the array of

[1281.059 - 1285.799] Connections in our brain and so with the

[1283.7 - 1287.3600000000001] right input or the right and sometimes

[1285.799 - 1288.98] the input can come from inside of our

[1287.36 - 1290.1789999999999] own brains like if you're sitting there

[1288.98 - 1292.159] thinking like I need to think about

[1290.179 - 1294.2] everything I know about Japan you can

[1292.159 - 1295.94] kind of you know trace the dots you can

[1294.2 - 1298.3600000000001] connect the dots and get you know kind

[1295.94 - 1300.5] of pull out memories from your own brain

[1298.36 - 1302.78] and we're doing the same thing here

[1300.5 - 1305.12] we're we're breaking apart that that

[1302.78 - 1306.5] cognitive process of okay let me think

[1305.12 - 1308.1789999999999] through about everything that I know

[1306.5 - 1309.26] about this

[1308.179 - 1311.72] um and so that's what we're doing

[1309.26 - 1315.08] deliberately

[1311.72 - 1315.919] um okay so we got this section

[1315.08 - 1318.62] um

[1315.919 - 1321.26] brainstorm some facts or things to

[1318.62 - 1327.6789999999999] include uh let's see you'll just repeat

[1321.26 - 1331.48] repeat this like two or three x times

[1327.679 - 1333.98] um and so then what then what we'll do

[1331.48 - 1337.64] is this is actually working better than

[1333.98 - 1341.74] I thought okay so we'll say

[1337.64 - 1341.74] we'll copy out some of this information

[1342.86 - 1347.9699999999998] and run it a couple times

[1344.78 - 1347.97] [Music]

[1351.32 - 1355.22] estimated 4 million followers see that's

[1353.9 - 1358.72] something where it's like 100 million

[1355.22 - 1358.72] and now there's four million like okay

[1361.159 - 1365.1200000000001] so we don't know if it's accurate but

[1363.44 - 1368.44] this could also be a benefit of running

[1365.12 - 1368.4399999999998] running it a few times

[1372.5 - 1378.22] yeah

[1374.24 - 1378.22] oops what just happened

[1378.75 - 1382.4] [Music]

[1381.02 - 1386.2] how did I do that

[1382.4 - 1386.2] current editor there we go

[1389.02 - 1394.84] okay so that's three iterations let's go

[1392.419 - 1394.8400000000001] for four

[1400.4 - 1407.0] because it seems like if you get four

[1404.179 - 1408.98] or first codified in the 8th Century CE

[1407.0 - 1412.1] according to the book I'm reading that

[1408.98 - 1414.26] is not true Japan didn't have written

[1412.1 - 1417.26] language until after the fourth Century

[1414.26 - 1420.14] a d c e

[1417.26 - 1423.8799999999999] so it couldn't have been codified

[1420.14 - 1423.88] and it's saying 4 million again

[1424.039 - 1429.5] so we will do fact checking in another

[1426.98 - 1430.4] video okay

[1429.5 - 1436.039] um

[1430.4 - 1438.799] all right I have compiled research notes

[1436.039 - 1443.0] um I have compiled the following

[1438.799 - 1445.7] research notes I need to rewrite these

[1443.0 - 1447.7] notes into

[1445.7 - 1447.7] um

[1448.58 - 1457.24] into a long

[1452.32 - 1460.46] professional blog post it must be

[1457.24 - 1463.159] engaging and interesting

[1460.46 - 1464.96] and so then we'll do research

[1463.159 - 1465.39] and then we'll do

[1464.96 - 1467.74] um

[1465.39 - 1471.6200000000001] [Music]

[1467.74 - 1473.36] engaging blog post and so basically all

[1471.62 - 1476.0] I'm going to do is take each of those

[1473.36 - 1479.24] sections do some research some internal

[1476.0 - 1482.539] brainstorming research and then we'll

[1479.24 - 1485.26] we'll generate a post on each of those

[1482.539 - 1485.26] sections

[1490.99 - 1494.46] [Music]

[1497.84 - 1503.36] now one thing is that will be that it

[1500.78 - 1506.539] that it will tend to do is it'll have

[1503.36 - 1508.34] these like little like sign offs right

[1506.539 - 1511.34] and it's like okay I don't want I don't

[1508.34 - 1514.52] want that but

[1511.34 - 1517.84] but we might have to deal with that

[1514.52 - 1517.84] okay anyways

[1518.36 - 1522.32] we'll probably can probably fix that at

[1520.4 - 1525.3400000000001] the end actually so let's go ahead and

[1522.32 - 1525.34] just copy this out

[1526.039 - 1528.58] okay

[1534.02 - 1540.1589999999999] um so do research

[1536.299 - 1540.1589999999999] and then engaging blog post

[1542.36 - 1545.539] and so this will be prompt

[1544.88 - 1548.419] um

[1545.539 - 1552.2] this will be uh

[1548.419 - 1555.38] section Pros so we're actually producing

[1552.2 - 1557.72] a final product at this point

[1555.38 - 1559.159] um yeah I think I think we're almost

[1557.72 - 1560.84] done

[1559.159 - 1564.1000000000001] because then we got the actual sections

[1560.84 - 1565.76] iterate and improve ah okay

[1564.1 - 1568.3999999999999] so

[1565.76 - 1570.62] yeah I like that

[1568.4 - 1574.88] um so if we if we

[1570.62 - 1576.9189999999999] take this we might need a second

[1574.88 - 1578.8400000000001] um okay yeah yeah this will actually

[1576.919 - 1580.159] work out well

[1578.84 - 1582.559] um I think I've got it all saved here

[1580.159 - 1584.7990000000002] yeah okay so then we'll just copy this

[1582.559 - 1584.799] here

[1590.96 - 1594.14] I wonder what will happen if I just say

[1592.88 - 1596.24] like

[1594.14 - 1597.2] let's see I've compiled I need to

[1596.24 - 1598.58] rewrite the notes into a long

[1597.2 - 1602.419] professional blog post it must be

[1598.58 - 1606.9189999999999] engaging I have the first draft

[1602.419 - 1610.7] of the post now I need to um

[1606.919 - 1611.5] improve on it okay so then we'll say

[1610.7 - 1614.659] um

[1611.5 - 1616.64] first draft

[1614.659 - 1618.5] oh hang on my dog's barking I gotta go

[1616.64 - 1620.8400000000001] see what he's barking at

[1618.5 - 1621.98] okay sorry about that

[1620.84 - 1626.059] um

[1621.98 - 1628.4] all right yes so first draft and then

[1626.059 - 1631.059] we'll just

[1628.4 - 1633.8600000000001] add some new lines and do second draft

[1631.059 - 1636.2] and you see like this this is getting

[1633.86 - 1637.4599999999998] long but one we've broken it down into

[1636.2 - 1638.419] sections

[1637.46 - 1639.679] um so we don't have to write the whole

[1638.419 - 1641.0590000000002] blog post at once and you see it's only

[1639.679 - 1643.1000000000001] a thousand tokens

[1641.059 - 1645.5] um so we're only at a quarter of our of

[1643.1 - 1647.74] our maximum

[1645.5 - 1647.74] um okay

[1656.059 - 1660.559] look at this

[1658.4 - 1664.3600000000001] Shinto believes in practices were first

[1660.559 - 1664.36] brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants

[1666.5 - 1672.62] I don't know that that's accurate

[1669.98 - 1675.08] but we see that this has this has gotten

[1672.62 - 1677.6589999999999] a little bit better

[1675.08 - 1679.8799999999999] um it's definitely integrating a little

[1677.659 - 1681.2] bit more of the information whether or

[1679.88 - 1683.179] not this information is factually

[1681.2 - 1685.279] accurate is different so in a future

[1683.179 - 1687.44] version I'll probably what I'll do is

[1685.279 - 1691.64] show you how to integrate from a corpus

[1687.44 - 1693.5] of facts of of of like

[1691.64 - 1696.0800000000002] other information rather than just

[1693.5 - 1698.059] relying on confabulation and neural

[1696.08 - 1701.6589999999999] recall so this when you ask when you ask

[1698.059 - 1703.82] gpt3 to just barf out a bunch of facts

[1701.659 - 1705.6200000000001] that's called neural recall and it can

[1703.82 - 1708.5] be pretty accurate

[1705.62 - 1710.0] um but it can also be crazy wrong

[1708.5 - 1713.299] um Okay so

[1710.0 - 1716.48] let's see what happens if we just do

[1713.299 - 1717.3799999999999] this iteration a couple more times

[1716.48 - 1719.299] so it's just

[1717.38 - 1721.96] [Music]

[1719.299 - 1721.96] whoops

[1723.38 - 1729.22] oh and it's just jumping down okay

[1727.039 - 1729.22] foreign

[1730.7 - 1734.44] it's actually making it shorter

[1735.62 - 1738.34] oh no

[1738.38 - 1744.1000000000001] clarified it a little bit

[1741.559 - 1744.1] okay

[1744.32 - 1748.8799999999999] okay so this this seems like it works

[1746.299 - 1753.1] okay so let's

[1748.88 - 1753.1000000000001] add this as a um

[1756.74 - 1760.58] so we'll do section

[1761.24 - 1767.44] second draft

[1763.1 - 1767.4399999999998] and then we'll do this as

[1768.799 - 1771.799] research

[1772.64 - 1776.96] add a double new line there just to make

[1774.559 - 1778.46] it nice and consistent and then we'll

[1776.96 - 1782.0] prompt

[1778.46 - 1783.919] um uh excuse me Pros

[1782.0 - 1788.0] um

[1783.919 - 1789.26] I actually do prompt improve Pros

[1788.0 - 1791.179] and then we'll just Stitch it all

[1789.26 - 1794.299] together and that's all programmatic um

[1791.179 - 1797.0590000000002] okay fault temperature to 7 The Tokens

[1794.299 - 1800.5] to one thousand

[1797.059 - 1800.5] because that's what we want all right

[1801.5 - 1806.48] uh let's see yeah

[1804.5 - 1809.899] um

[1806.48 - 1814.3600000000001] well first we need the uh the topic okay

[1809.899 - 1820.34] so topic equals open file and we'll do

[1814.36 - 1820.34] topic.txt so I will save that

[1821.12 - 1827.02] here

[1822.86 - 1830.089] so save topic dot text

[1827.02 - 1830.089] [Music]

[1833.6 - 1839.12] all right so we get the topic and then

[1835.64 - 1842.7990000000002] the first thing we do is outline it

[1839.12 - 1842.799] and then we improve the outline okay

[1843.02 - 1848.5] I've got too many tabs open let me close

[1845.96 - 1848.5] some of these

[1856.279 - 1860.24] ah no don't close that one cancel cancel

[1858.73 - 1861.44] [Music]

[1860.24 - 1863.86] abort

[1861.44 - 1863.8600000000001] okay

[1867.98 - 1874.039] and then we'll say

[1869.6 - 1875.1999999999998] um let's see outline equals

[1874.039 - 1878.259] change

[1875.2 - 1878.259] [Music]

[1879.38 - 1884.96] um yeah

[1881.98 - 1886.3990000000001] here I'll just do this the messy way I

[1884.96 - 1887.8990000000001] can work on cleaning it up and making it

[1886.399 - 1889.1589999999999] more efficient later I have coffee and

[1887.899 - 1891.6999999999998] I'm not drinking it what the heck is

[1889.159 - 1891.7] wrong with me

[1892.94 - 1896.16] [Music]

[1897.14 - 1899.2990000000002] epic

[1898.34 - 1903.82] um okay

[1899.299 - 1903.82] so now we're gonna do build the outline

[1905.08 - 1911.24] prompt equals

[1908.059 - 1912.86] open file so this was

[1911.24 - 1915.64] see this is why I need to keep at least

[1912.86 - 1915.6399999999999] the prompts open

[1916.76 - 1920.62] all right so prompt outline and then

[1919.22 - 1923.48] it'll be prompt

[1920.62 - 1924.799] improve outline and then section

[1923.48 - 1927.64] research

[1924.799 - 1930.799] which will just run a few times prompt

[1927.64 - 1933.919] improve Pros

[1930.799 - 1936.679] um okay and then Pros okay cool

[1933.919 - 1939.94] so the outline we only run once so do

[1936.679 - 1941.96] prompt outline

[1939.94 - 1945.74] dot text

[1941.96 - 1946.3400000000001] and then we'll do dot replace

[1945.74 - 1950.559] um

[1946.34 - 1950.559] topic or no I guess it was request

[1950.6 - 1955.1589999999999] yeah

[1952.34 - 1957.82] so just to keep things consistent we'll

[1955.159 - 1957.8200000000002] do request

[1958.7 - 1964.52] because the worst thing you can do for

[1960.38 - 1966.44] yourself is use use multiple names for

[1964.52 - 1969.08] the same variable it's very confusing I

[1966.44 - 1971.539] do not recommend that

[1969.08 - 1973.6999999999998] yeah all right sorry I'm having to lean

[1971.539 - 1975.44] away from from my microphone again and

[1973.7 - 1978.559] it's making it's throwing off my whole

[1975.44 - 1980.659] keyboard situation

[1978.559 - 1983.1789999999999] as someone who writes it's like there's

[1980.659 - 1984.2600000000002] this flow connection

[1983.179 - 1987.02] um and you can't hear it because I've

[1984.26 - 1988.82] got the uh the like noise cancellation

[1987.02 - 1990.26] but I use a mechanical keyboard so

[1988.82 - 1992.539] you're welcome for that

[1990.26 - 1995.0] for you seeing the thing I use Nvidia

[1992.539 - 1996.799] broadcast which is really helpful

[1995.0 - 1998.36] um okay so we're replacing it request

[1996.799 - 2001.4189999999999] with the request

[1998.36 - 2003.1] that should be good

[2001.419 - 2003.7] um and then we'll do

[2003.1 - 2008.32] um

[2003.7 - 2009.1000000000001] outline equals we'll do one

[2008.32 - 2013.6589999999999] um

[2009.1 - 2013.6589999999999] plus and we're going to remove that

[2014.14 - 2020.6200000000001] and then we'll do plus

[2016.96 - 2023.32] um gpt3 completion prompt

[2020.62 - 2025.9599999999998] okay and then for debug we'll just print

[2023.32 - 2028.24] the outline and we'll run this to make

[2025.96 - 2031.6000000000001] sure that it works

[2028.24 - 2035.2] um python generate whoops

[2031.6 - 2036.519] CD Auto Muse

[2035.2 - 2039.17] blogger

[2036.519 - 2041.159] python generate

[2039.17 - 2043.299] [Music]

[2041.159 - 2045.1000000000001] request.txt right because I changed the

[2043.299 - 2048.72] file name in here but it didn't read my

[2045.1 - 2048.72] mind and change the file name out here

[2048.82 - 2052.5] okay try that again

[2054.22 - 2059.919] okay cool

[2056.619 - 2062.9190000000003] so that worked that looks good

[2059.919 - 2064.06] um all right so then what did I do I did

[2062.919 - 2065.859] um

[2064.06 - 2067.96] see this is this is why you write down

[2065.859 - 2070.2999999999997] what your plan is

[2067.96 - 2073.119] open the readme back up

[2070.3 - 2074.8] um okay so we got that iterate on the

[2073.119 - 2076.599] list that's right we did this about four

[2074.8 - 2079.54] times

[2076.599 - 2085.839] um okay so then we'll say

[2079.54 - 2089.58] um for I and list range zero four

[2085.839 - 2092.859] we are going to do outline equals

[2089.58 - 2096.639] improve outline

[2092.859 - 2099.04] and then we'll pass it the request and

[2096.639 - 2100.7200000000003] the outline and so basically this is

[2099.04 - 2102.4] this is the easiest way to do a

[2100.72 - 2105.339] recursive thing

[2102.4 - 2107.56] so we'll do def improve outline and

[2105.339 - 2109.359] we're going to have the request and the

[2107.56 - 2111.22] outline passed in

[2109.359 - 2112.42] and so then we're just going to use this

[2111.22 - 2113.98] prompt

[2112.42 - 2117.2400000000002] um so we say

[2113.98 - 2122.14] prompt equals

[2117.24 - 2124.4799999999996] open file prompt improve

[2122.14 - 2127.24] outline dot text and so what you're

[2124.48 - 2129.579] seeing here this is this is the um the

[2127.24 - 2132.7] most basic form of recursive programming

[2129.579 - 2134.6800000000003] with gpt3 where you feed the same the

[2132.7 - 2136.359] output into the same function several

[2134.68 - 2137.14] times

[2136.359 - 2139.96] um

[2137.14 - 2141.94] so dot replace

[2139.96 - 2146.35] request

[2141.94 - 2146.619] with request and then dot replace

[2146.35 - 2147.94] [Music]

[2146.619 - 2151.78] um

[2147.94 - 2153.64] outline with outline make sure that I

[2151.78 - 2155.38] use the right terminology yes outline is

[2153.64 - 2156.7599999999998] there brainstorm some possible

[2155.38 - 2160.56] improvements

[2156.76 - 2163.5400000000004] okay and then we'll copy the same

[2160.56 - 2165.46] outline one dot and so the reason that

[2163.54 - 2169.18] you have to include this

[2165.46 - 2171.16] is because the prompt already has that

[2169.18 - 2172.72] see if you don't have that then the

[2171.16 - 2175.2999999999997] first one will not have its numbered

[2172.72 - 2177.7] list and that just it just it's bad form

[2175.3 - 2180.82] and it doesn't look good and then we'll

[2177.7 - 2183.8799999999997] do return outline

[2180.82 - 2186.599] okay so then we will

[2183.88 - 2186.599] um here we'll

[2188.2 - 2194.2] actually for debug purposes I'll just

[2190.66 - 2195.8799999999997] leave all this to do new line new line

[2194.2 - 2199.14] outline

[2195.88 - 2199.1400000000003] and then we'll do

[2202.8 - 2210.3590000000004] improved outline okay

[2206.68 - 2210.359] now let's test this real quick

[2212.74 - 2216.7] what is Shinto

[2214.9 - 2219.64] tips for visiting

[2216.7 - 2222.3999999999996] facts okay so it is it is reliably

[2219.64 - 2224.44] recreating what we wanted

[2222.4 - 2228.88] and then it converged

[2224.44 - 2232.66] uh and then it blew it up

[2228.88 - 2235.42] curse you okay

[2232.66 - 2238.1189999999997] yeah it didn't it it just it randomly

[2235.42 - 2239.8] nuked it okay let's have fewer

[2238.119 - 2242.8] iterations

[2239.8 - 2246.579] because if you do if you if you if you

[2242.8 - 2248.38] try your luck it will eventually Break

[2246.579 - 2251.92] um the coolest Tory gates in Japan

[2248.38 - 2253.06] different types of Contour Gates

[2251.92 - 2255.64] okay

[2253.06 - 2258.339] so doing One initial iteration and then

[2255.64 - 2260.56] three iterations seems to be good all

[2258.339 - 2261.7] right so we'll leave it at that

[2260.56 - 2264.22] um cool

[2261.7 - 2265.96] so actually it can be kind of fun to

[2264.22 - 2267.16] leave the uh the debug output so I'll

[2265.96 - 2268.66] probably just leave that there so that

[2267.16 - 2271.66] when you're running it you can see what

[2268.66 - 2273.96] it's doing okay now we consult the

[2271.66 - 2277.24] scriptures we got the good list

[2273.96 - 2278.32] brainstorm some facts or points for each

[2277.24 - 2280.06] one

[2278.32 - 2284.2000000000003] yes

[2280.06 - 2285.88] okay so then section research

[2284.2 - 2290.3199999999997] yes okay

[2285.88 - 2293.38] so sections equal outline dot split

[2290.32 - 2295.54] lines so now the sections list we can

[2293.38 - 2298.359] iterate on this

[2295.54 - 2301.119] um a few times

[2298.359 - 2304.02] but we're actually zeroing in on the

[2301.119 - 2304.02] final product

[2304.06 - 2306.839] so

[2306.94 - 2311.5] let me think of how to do this

[2309.64 - 2313.7799999999997] because

[2311.5 - 2316.119] do we want to write it one section at a

[2313.78 - 2318.0400000000004] time I think we do

[2316.119 - 2320.32] yeah because the way that the way that

[2318.04 - 2322.42] it breaks down now is we do the research

[2320.32 - 2323.6800000000003] on the section we do the pros on the

[2322.42 - 2326.26] section and then we stitch it all

[2323.68 - 2328.54] together we improve the pros and then we

[2326.26 - 2332.619] have the final product okay so we'll do

[2328.54 - 2337.54] final blog equals so we'll do that

[2332.619 - 2339.28] okay so four section in sections so

[2337.54 - 2340.9] we're gonna just we're gonna take each

[2339.28 - 2342.88] section and just write the whole thing

[2340.9 - 2345.28] we might have a final step where we kind

[2342.88 - 2346.96] of like clean up the whole blog

[2345.28 - 2348.46] um actually that's not a bad idea let me

[2346.96 - 2350.2] go ahead and add that note so I don't

[2348.46 - 2351.64] forget

[2350.2 - 2353.7999999999997] um iterate through the sections and done

[2351.64 - 2357.2799999999997] lies

[2353.8 - 2358.8390000000004] um uh let's see clean up the final

[2357.28 - 2360.7000000000003] product

[2358.839 - 2363.4] yes

[2360.7 - 2366.839] okay so four section in sections uh

[2363.4 - 2366.839] first is hashtag research

[2367.9 - 2372.2400000000002] sorry I need to drink this coffee

[2374.82 - 2381.54] #research okay

[2377.98 - 2383.44] um yes so we'll say

[2381.54 - 2385.2] research

[2383.44 - 2388.54] equals

[2385.2 - 2390.7] uh that and then

[2388.54 - 2392.079] uh let's see how many times did we do

[2390.7 - 2393.339] this I think we did it like three or

[2392.079 - 2395.2000000000003] four times

[2393.339 - 2397.7799999999997] so we'll do we'll do the same thing that

[2395.2 - 2400.5989999999997] we did here so for I

[2397.78 - 2401.619] in list range we'll say

[2400.599 - 2404.28] um

[2401.619 - 2404.28] uh uh

[2404.68 - 2409.859] result equals

[2407.8 - 2409.8590000000004] um

[2411.22 - 2414.54] research topic

[2414.7 - 2418.18] actually no here we'll call it neural

[2416.5 - 2420.04] recall because that's a more accurate

[2418.18 - 2421.48] thing as to what we're doing so the

[2420.04 - 2422.98] neural recall

[2421.48 - 2424.839] is

[2422.98 - 2425.98] yeah so we need to pass the request in

[2424.839 - 2428.98] the section

[2425.98 - 2430.72] requests section

[2428.98 - 2432.04] and there will be some redundancy but

[2430.72 - 2433.7799999999997] that's fine that's why we added the

[2432.04 - 2436.0] seventh step to clean up the final

[2433.78 - 2439.119] product to just let's rewrite the whole

[2436.0 - 2439.34] thing to be one nice consistent blog

[2439.119 - 2441.099] post

[2439.34 - 2443.26] [Music]

[2441.099 - 2446.52] um okay

[2443.26 - 2449.8590000000004] so result equals neural recall

[2446.52 - 2452.02] deaf neural recall

[2449.859 - 2454.06] this is like

[2452.02 - 2455.079] this is the nerdier version of Total

[2454.06 - 2458.74] Recall

[2455.079 - 2460.7200000000003] uh request extra points if uh I guess

[2458.74 - 2463.18] they made a remake of that

[2460.72 - 2465.52] um but the original Total recalled with

[2463.18 - 2466.48] Arnold Schwarzenegger came out when I

[2465.52 - 2468.7] was

[2466.48 - 2471.099] uh much younger

[2468.7 - 2473.3199999999997] I was alive when it came out some of my

[2471.099 - 2476.92] viewers are older than me many of them

[2473.32 - 2479.1400000000003] are younger so if you raise your hand uh

[2476.92 - 2480.88] give me a thumbs up or or a comment in

[2479.14 - 2482.98] the section in the in the comments below

[2480.88 - 2484.2400000000002] if you remember the original Total

[2482.98 - 2485.44] Recall

[2484.24 - 2487.2999999999997] okay

[2485.44 - 2489.599] neural recall what is it that we're

[2487.3 - 2494.52] doing this is basically just another

[2489.599 - 2498.579] prompt prompt equals open file uh prompt

[2494.52 - 2502.859] section research dot text and then we do

[2498.579 - 2504.94] that replace uh yes

[2502.859 - 2507.96] what were the sections that I had in

[2504.94 - 2510.52] here request and section right these two

[2507.96 - 2512.38] see that is where you do yourself a

[2510.52 - 2513.88] favor if you have variables that are

[2512.38 - 2515.859] very simple and straightforward and make

[2513.88 - 2521.38] sense

[2515.859 - 2526.2] and then Place uh section

[2521.38 - 2529.119] with Section okay and then we do

[2526.2 - 2534.46] uh let's see

[2529.119 - 2537.04] um notes equal gpt3 completion prompt

[2534.46 - 2538.18] um and then return notes and I know what

[2537.04 - 2542.079] some of you are thinking you're thinking

[2538.18 - 2542.68] oh you can just do return this

[2542.079 - 2544.8390000000004] um

[2542.68 - 2545.98] there's nothing wrong with that but I

[2544.839 - 2547.7799999999997] got out of the habit of doing that

[2545.98 - 2549.52] because every now and then you'll want

[2547.78 - 2552.82] to do some little like post-processing

[2549.52 - 2556.119] like notes equals notes dot replace you

[2552.82 - 2558.46] know that with that you know depending

[2556.119 - 2559.359] on uh the kind of format you're looking

[2558.46 - 2561.7] for

[2559.359 - 2564.8199999999997] um so I just got out of the habit of of

[2561.7 - 2567.2799999999997] returning the function result directly

[2564.82 - 2568.6600000000003] um and and capturing the results in a

[2567.28 - 2570.579] variable and then passing the variable

[2568.66 - 2571.72] back it's either or you can do whatever

[2570.579 - 2574.0] you want

[2571.72 - 2576.7] um it saves you a line of code

[2574.0 - 2578.079] um but you know okay a line of code who

[2576.7 - 2581.14] cares

[2578.079 - 2585.7000000000003] um to me it's not really worth saving

[2581.14 - 2588.7] okay so then research equals research

[2585.7 - 2588.7] plus

[2589.119 - 2595.1800000000003] um let's see that's going to have no new

[2591.819 - 2599.14] line so we'll do plus new line

[2595.18 - 2601.8999999999996] dollar s and then we'll do dollar result

[2599.14 - 2605.14] um yes okay so the research will be done

[2601.9 - 2608.28] so research equals research dot strip

[2605.14 - 2611.3799999999997] which that will remove any Superfluous

[2608.28 - 2614.1600000000003] white space from the ends so now we've

[2611.38 - 2614.1600000000003] got the research

[2615.28 - 2620.98] yes so we'll run the research a couple

[2617.8 - 2622.9] times we've done the research and then

[2620.98 - 2623.98] we take the research and write the blog

[2622.9 - 2625.2400000000002] post

[2623.98 - 2629.22] okay

[2625.24 - 2632.2] so do first draft

[2629.22 - 2633.5789999999997] not draft five

[2632.2 - 2635.56] um okay

[2633.579 - 2637.44] this should be as straightforward as

[2635.56 - 2641.7999999999997] prompt equals

[2637.44 - 2646.359] prompt section no

[2641.8 - 2648.54] what am I doing good grief open file

[2646.359 - 2653.5] prompt

[2648.54 - 2655.18] sectionpros dot text and do replace

[2653.5 - 2658.0] research

[2655.18 - 2659.2] with research so this is there's a

[2658.0 - 2661.599] couple things happening here so there's

[2659.2 - 2664.2999999999997] prompt chaining which is where you've

[2661.599 - 2666.46] got prompt prompt prompt prompt prompt

[2664.3 - 2668.1400000000003] so that's prompt chaining but then we're

[2666.46 - 2670.18] also doing iterative Loops so we're

[2668.14 - 2672.16] doing recursive Loops inside of the

[2670.18 - 2672.94] prompt chain

[2672.16 - 2675.04] um

[2672.94 - 2676.599] so this is this is pretty Advanced but

[2675.04 - 2678.88] this is this is just the same process

[2676.599 - 2681.94] that a human goes through when writing

[2678.88 - 2684.52] when writing a thing you you brainstorm

[2681.94 - 2685.96] the structure you gather all the facts

[2684.52 - 2688.66] then you write the pros and then you

[2685.96 - 2690.7200000000003] iterate on the pros and make it better

[2688.66 - 2690.72] um

[2691.3 - 2695.98] now I need to improve on it I wonder if

[2693.7 - 2697.4199999999996] it would be good if we gave it some

[2695.98 - 2699.04] descriptions like we need to make it

[2697.42 - 2702.3] more engaging

[2699.04 - 2702.3] um but whatever okay

[2704.08 - 2709.42] [Music]

[2706.48 - 2712.96] prompt open file okay and so then we'll

[2709.42 - 2715.7200000000003] say Pros equals

[2712.96 - 2718.38] bd3 completion

[2715.72 - 2718.3799999999997] um prompt

[2719.079 - 2721.8590000000004] there you have it

[2721.9 - 2726.1600000000003] all right so that's our first edition of

[2723.88 - 2727.9] the pros and then we do the same thing

[2726.16 - 2730.3799999999997] here where we attach the research and

[2727.9 - 2730.38] the pros

[2730.78 - 2735.52] this should actually probably we'll

[2732.52 - 2738.52] change this to Pros

[2735.52 - 2740.2] keep it nice and consistent

[2738.52 - 2742.3] and I think we did it what like two or

[2740.2 - 2745.14] three times before it started kind of

[2742.3 - 2745.1400000000003] going off the rails

[2746.02 - 2751.0] so we'll do we'll do just two

[2747.52 - 2754.96] improvements of improving the pros

[2751.0 - 2756.3] um okay so Pros equals

[2754.96 - 2760.0] um

[2756.3 - 2762.2200000000003] uh improve Pros

[2760.0 - 2764.319] and so what did I have in here we have

[2762.22 - 2767.74] the research on the pros

[2764.319 - 2769.66] research and prose

[2767.74 - 2772.0] um so we just improve itself so

[2769.66 - 2775.0] recursive programming for for kitties

[2772.0 - 2777.4] who don't know you could not do this

[2775.0 - 2779.26] where you pass a variable where you you

[2777.4 - 2781.7200000000003] assign a variable and pass it at the

[2779.26 - 2783.88] same time this is a newer thing back in

[2781.72 - 2785.4399999999996] the days of Pascal and C plus plus you

[2783.88 - 2787.78] have what you would have to do uh you'd

[2785.44 - 2790.599] have to declare something like prose 2

[2787.78 - 2794.1400000000003] equals pros and then you'd say Pros

[2790.599 - 2796.1800000000003] equals Pros too is silly but now you

[2794.14 - 2798.16] don't have to do that anymore

[2796.18 - 2800.2] now you can just call it directly and

[2798.16 - 2803.44] it's just a single step

[2800.2 - 2807.64] um okay so the improved Pros is going to

[2803.44 - 2812.859] be the same as improve outline

[2807.64 - 2815.56] with mild difference so we'll do improve

[2812.859 - 2817.5989999999997] pros and instead of

[2815.56 - 2820.02] request and outline its research and

[2817.599 - 2820.02] prose

[2821.04 - 2827.859] so we'll do

[2823.3 - 2829.48] um improve Pros research

[2827.859 - 2831.2799999999997] oops

[2829.48 - 2832.9] uppercase

[2831.28 - 2834.579] and Pros

[2832.9 - 2837.6600000000003] oh whoops

[2834.579 - 2837.6600000000003] I'm going to replace both

[2837.88 - 2842.46] lowercase

[2839.319 - 2842.46] and then Pros

[2844.0 - 2847.72] uppercase

[2845.319 - 2850.54] and then we don't need

[2847.72 - 2852.3999999999996] that and so then we also change the name

[2850.54 - 2856.3] back to prose

[2852.4 - 2858.04] and prose okay so then we call improved

[2856.3 - 2861.46] Pros we just call it a handful of times

[2858.04 - 2863.319] and we end up with a better set of pros

[2861.46 - 2866.14] and actually what we'll do is we'll

[2863.319 - 2868.18] declare the final blog as a list

[2866.14 - 2871.66] and so then we'll do

[2868.18 - 2874.96] um final blog dot append

[2871.66 - 2877.42] um Pros so that'll be a list of sections

[2874.96 - 2878.619] that we can then we can keep them

[2877.42 - 2881.319] separate so that we can give them

[2878.619 - 2885.06] headers and also we can continue to

[2881.319 - 2885.06] improve them separately if we want

[2885.16 - 2888.52] are we done

[2886.78 - 2890.1400000000003] hold on

[2888.52 - 2891.579] this is what happens to me I get so

[2890.14 - 2894.0989999999997] focused on what I'm doing that it's just

[2891.579 - 2895.3590000000004] like wait that's the end right I know

[2894.099 - 2898.48] there is one last thing but I want to

[2895.359 - 2901.06] see how this looks before we do the

[2898.48 - 2903.599] final step which is this one clean up

[2901.06 - 2907.48] the final product

[2903.599 - 2908.56] okay so let's give some whoops

[2907.48 - 2911.319] let's come back here let's get some

[2908.56 - 2913.62] output as we go

[2911.319 - 2915.52] so we'll print

[2913.62 - 2919.5989999999997] [Music]

[2915.52 - 2919.599] new line new line research

[2920.56 - 2922.68] um

[2923.35 - 2928.319] [Music]

[2925.119 - 2932.859] yeah so we'll do first we'll print

[2928.319 - 2932.859] new line new line section

[2933.46 - 2937.7200000000003] section

[2935.38 - 2940.48] use that variable right yep so then we

[2937.72 - 2942.04] do the section and then we do research

[2940.48 - 2945.76] because we need to we need something to

[2942.04 - 2948.52] look at while we're you know doing this

[2945.76 - 2952.9] um and I'll do print

[2948.52 - 2952.9] uh new line new line Pros

[2952.92 - 2958.599] and then we'll just copy this down here

[2956.2 - 2961.06] and then it'll be appended and so then

[2958.599 - 2963.46] finally

[2961.06 - 2965.319] here at the end of all things

[2963.46 - 2966.16] we will just do

[2965.319 - 2968.2] um

[2966.16 - 2970.839] here we'll do

[2968.2 - 2973.4199999999996] from P print import

[2970.839 - 2974.56] s so this is pretty print so we'll do

[2973.42 - 2977.079] pretty print

[2974.56 - 2979.359] final blog and this is just for debug

[2977.079 - 2980.8] okay so let's

[2979.359 - 2983.0789999999997] I need to zoom out a little bit because

[2980.8 - 2985.2400000000002] this is enormous well now let's see

[2983.079 - 2987.46] let's see how it looks okay

[2985.24 - 2989.25] generate a Blog end to end

[2987.46 - 2991.7400000000002] history of Shinto

[2989.25 - 2995.16] [Music]

[2991.74 - 2995.16] improved outline

[2996.22 - 3000.18] predictions for the future of the

[2997.96 - 3002.96] religion that's cool

[3000.18 - 3002.96] heck yeah

[3006.599 - 3009.839] oh wow

[3008.099 - 3012.619] that got real long so we're gonna have

[3009.839 - 3012.619] 10 sections

[3022.2 - 3027.54] we'll probably like accelerate this oops

[3024.42 - 3029.46] it crashed research is not defined what

[3027.54 - 3033.8] do you mean I did a typo

[3029.46 - 3033.8] let's see this is line 87.

[3035.339 - 3040.56] right here

[3037.92 - 3042.92] dang so close but this is why you test

[3040.56 - 3042.92] your code

[3044.579 - 3047.28] all right

[3045.78 - 3048.48] let's do this again all right I am going

[3047.28 - 3050.76] to make it a little smaller because this

[3048.48 - 3053.54] is outputting quite a bit

[3050.76 - 3057.5] so we'll do we'll go down to 24. there

[3053.54 - 3057.5] how to build a toy gate

[3063.96 - 3068.96] there we go

[3065.88 - 3068.96] oh we've got

[3073.14 - 3079.22] and we've got the double new lines so

[3075.48 - 3079.22] for the out for the final outline

[3079.44 - 3082.02] um

[3080.22 - 3085.98] outline

[3082.02 - 3090.18] equals outline dot replace and we'll do

[3085.98 - 3091.98] double new line with just single new

[3090.18 - 3094.44] line

[3091.98 - 3096.9] because we're going to end up with

[3094.44 - 3100.52] yeah okay but this is this is this is

[3096.9 - 3100.52] all right so far so good

[3103.8 - 3106.7000000000003] foreign

[3110.46 - 3117.859] and then the section has nothing yeah

[3113.64 - 3117.859] darn it darn it

[3123.559 - 3127.579] and it puts out nothing

[3131.04 - 3133.859] we'll just let it finish and see what

[3132.599 - 3138.02] happens

[3133.859 - 3138.02] there are about 80 000 Shinto shrines

[3138.96 - 3142.58] there's all of our research so that's

[3140.88 - 3145.659] good

[3142.58 - 3145.659] [Music]

[3150.0 - 3153.619] welcome to my blog about Shinto

[3155.46 - 3159.359] Okay cool so this is going to iterate

[3157.98 - 3161.579] through each of these sections for a

[3159.359 - 3163.68] little while I think I'm gonna go ahead

[3161.579 - 3165.48] and pause the video and uh we'll see

[3163.68 - 3167.0989999999997] because you get you get the idea we

[3165.48 - 3168.359] don't need to read this so we'll pause

[3167.099 - 3171.3590000000004] the video we'll come back once it's done

[3168.359 - 3172.02] it worked mostly

[3171.359 - 3173.88] um

[3172.02 - 3175.319] It produced a lot of content I'll put it

[3173.88 - 3177.42] that way

[3175.319 - 3181.02] um now unfortunately this was just a

[3177.42 - 3183.119] test run so we've got all this so let's

[3181.02 - 3187.44] just

[3183.119 - 3191.4] just get all this out to

[3187.44 - 3192.9] a text file and um so I I added this

[3191.4 - 3194.4] while we were waiting where it'll

[3192.9 - 3196.559] actually save it out to file because I

[3194.4 - 3198.42] should have done that and I'll probably

[3196.559 - 3199.92] separate out so that we'll clean up the

[3198.42 - 3202.559] blog afterwards

[3199.92 - 3205.92] but first let's just see what we've got

[3202.559 - 3208.8] so let's do a refined and replace

[3205.92 - 3210.359] the single quotes with nothing

[3208.8 - 3212.579] place all

[3210.359 - 3213.48] and then we'll replace

[3212.579 - 3218.54] um

[3213.48 - 3218.54] backslash backslash n with nothing

[3218.7 - 3224.3999999999996] actually no this will be normal finder

[3220.98 - 3226.64] place so that cleans that up yeah there

[3224.4 - 3226.64] we go

[3227.52 - 3229.88] um okay

[3232.26 - 3236.46] that is yeah there's a lot I'm not going

[3234.54 - 3239.52] to read the whole thing but we've got

[3236.46 - 3241.559] it's 21 000 characters long

[3239.52 - 3244.859] um so clearly this is like

[3241.559 - 3246.5400000000004] yeah this this this is quite a bit

[3244.859 - 3249.48] um I think what I'm gonna do

[3246.54 - 3253.619] uh because that's that's well how many

[3249.48 - 3257.64] tokens is this let's plug this into

[3253.619 - 3260.04] 50 5 000 tokens so we want it to be

[3257.64 - 3261.9] maybe

[3260.04 - 3264.18] half that

[3261.9 - 3265.619] maybe not quite as long so what we'll do

[3264.18 - 3267.2999999999997] is

[3265.619 - 3270.059] we'll do

[3267.3 - 3271.6800000000003] um just a little bit less research and a

[3270.059 - 3275.099] little bit less

[3271.68 - 3276.96] a little bit less brainstorming

[3275.099 - 3278.28] um so hopefully that will make it a

[3276.96 - 3281.46] little bit more reasonable because what

[3278.28 - 3283.8590000000004] I'd like to be able to do is to do the

[3281.46 - 3286.319] final Cleanup in one window

[3283.859 - 3287.7599999999998] um and we can't do that right now

[3286.319 - 3289.74] um Okay so

[3287.76 - 3291.119] we've got this I've got it so it'll save

[3289.74 - 3293.64] it out to file I wish that I had done

[3291.119 - 3295.7400000000002] this the first time but what we're going

[3293.64 - 3298.3799999999997] to do is we're going to choose an

[3295.74 - 3300.7799999999997] entirely different topic because I

[3298.38 - 3301.98] tested it on one topic

[3300.78 - 3306.7200000000003] um

[3301.98 - 3308.88] so I want a blog post about the history

[3306.72 - 3309.98] of the printing

[3308.88 - 3313.619] press

[3309.98 - 3316.16] I'd like to know how it influenced

[3313.619 - 3319.1400000000003] religion

[3316.16 - 3322.6189999999997] politics and War

[3319.14 - 3324.839] throughout history and up through the

[3322.619 - 3325.98] Modern Age

[3324.839 - 3330.5589999999997] um okay

[3325.98 - 3330.559] so I'm gonna go ahead and kick this off

[3330.599 - 3334.5] generate blog and then we'll come back

[3332.64 - 3336.48] with a brand new blog and then we will

[3334.5 - 3340.02] get into

[3336.48 - 3344.16] um we'll get into the um the process of

[3340.02 - 3344.16] improving a Blog automatically

[3344.76 - 3349.5] um why is it doing nothing

[3347.16 - 3351.92] did it not do any research oh there it

[3349.5 - 3351.92] is okay

[3353.4 - 3355.98] there we go

[3354.96 - 3359.54] um okay so I'm gonna go ahead and pause

[3355.98 - 3359.54] it and we'll come back in just a second

[3361.8 - 3366.48] okay we have a blog post about the

[3364.44 - 3368.2200000000003] printing press

[3366.48 - 3370.02] um and I think I actually lied I think

[3368.22 - 3372.5989999999997] I'm gonna call it here because this is

[3370.02 - 3376.2] actually not bad

[3372.599 - 3379.38] um and it doing improving an existing

[3376.2 - 3381.24] document is worth its own project so I

[3379.38 - 3384.98] think what's going to come after this is

[3381.24 - 3387.66] I'll have one video or a project about

[3384.98 - 3390.0] pulling from external sources like how

[3387.66 - 3391.68] to search and automatically compile

[3390.0 - 3394.44] sources because that has applications

[3391.68 - 3395.839] all over the place such as automated

[3394.44 - 3398.76] research

[3395.839 - 3400.98] for like Academia not just writing blogs

[3398.76 - 3402.78] and then automatically improving stuff

[3400.98 - 3404.4] at basically being an editor is a whole

[3402.78 - 3407.6600000000003] other function

[3404.4 - 3414.119] so we will call this a day get status

[3407.66 - 3415.92] get add git commit am all done and get

[3414.119 - 3418.92] push

[3415.92 - 3421.079] so uh yeah so there's a blog post out

[3418.92 - 3424.98] here it is now 10 000 characters long

[3421.079 - 3426.3] which means that it should fit into a

[3424.98 - 3429.42] single

[3426.3 - 3432.78] um yeah window so you could in theory

[3429.42 - 3434.46] ask gpt3 hey take this blog post and

[3432.78 - 3436.02] rewrite it if you want to I'm not going

[3434.46 - 3438.0] to worry about it

[3436.02 - 3440.7599999999998] um because yeah this video is already

[3438.0 - 3444.24] plenty long and you have you now have an

[3440.76 - 3447.059] end to end process of prompt chaining

[3444.24 - 3450.4199999999996] and recursive prompting

[3447.059 - 3451.6800000000003] um in order to generate you know be very

[3450.42 - 3454.079] generative and make something better

[3451.68 - 3456.18] remember use this responsibly I am not

[3454.079 - 3458.04] responsible if you uh use this to do

[3456.18 - 3458.7599999999998] something unethical

[3458.04 - 3461.94] um
