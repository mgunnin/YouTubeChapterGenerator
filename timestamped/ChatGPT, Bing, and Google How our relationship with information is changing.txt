[0.359 - 7.259] hi Bae okay so um a few days ago I

[4.74 - 9.72] released videos that uh have not aged

[7.259 - 12.36] well it's fine I'm often wrong um if you

[9.72 - 14.46] remember I released a video originally

[12.36 - 17.34] that said I was super not impressed with

[14.46 - 20.52] chat GPT that was wrong I released

[17.34 - 23.52] another video saying that Google won

[20.52 - 25.619] that remains to be seen we'll see uh but

[23.52 - 28.5] the theme of today's video is about the

[25.619 - 30.599] future of search and um particularly

[28.5 - 34.14] information foraging and information

[30.599 - 35.1] strategies so uh yeah the there's mixed

[34.14 - 37.02] results

[35.1 - 39.54] um searches here forever search is toast

[37.02 - 43.440000000000005] I'm falling into the camp that searches

[39.54 - 46.44] toast so let me while this is going I

[43.44 - 48.48] will show you what I mean and we'll

[46.44 - 49.98] explore this together kind of in real

[48.48 - 53.339999999999996] time

[49.98 - 56.879] um so I've looked at how I have actually

[53.34 - 60.0] ended up using chat GPT I don't use it

[56.879 - 63.12] for homework I don't use it for writing

[60.0 - 65.22] fiction I sometimes use it to brainstorm

[63.12 - 66.84] so like you see this one like uh

[65.22 - 69.36] basically like doing doing a little bit

[66.84 - 71.76] of research oops I canceled that only

[69.36 - 74.64] one message at a time okay anyways

[71.76 - 76.56] um it'll probably finish loading So like

[74.64 - 79.32] um I did I did do a couple videos where

[76.56 - 81.54] I used chat GPT to help and I actually

[79.32 - 84.65899999999999] um I I can figure out how to get chat

[81.54 - 86.759] GPT to write fiction like basically be a

[84.659 - 90.18] co-writer but honestly it ends up taking

[86.759 - 93.18] uh just as much energy and concentration

[90.18 - 94.57900000000001] as just writing so I don't think AI

[93.18 - 97.56] tools

[94.579 - 99.119] brainstorming planning okay sure

[97.56 - 101.52] um certainly can help with like coming

[99.119 - 103.619] up with character ideas but the actual

[101.52 - 105.84] Act of writing I think is going to be a

[103.619 - 108.119] human thing for a while

[105.84 - 109.74000000000001] um that being said this is very early so

[108.119 - 111.119] we should expect it to replace it

[109.74 - 113.15899999999999] eventually

[111.119 - 115.68] um but mostly what I end up using it for

[113.159 - 117.54] is research

[115.68 - 119.159] and when I say research I don't mean

[117.54 - 122.159] like scientific research and connecting

[119.159 - 124.02000000000001] data but I mean gathering information so

[122.159 - 126.119] rather than going to Wikipedia rather

[124.02 - 128.88] than going to Google rather than looking

[126.119 - 130.679] for blogs I ask the questions here and I

[128.88 - 133.739] basically tell it here's what I'm trying

[130.679 - 136.319] to do here's the information that I have

[133.739 - 140.09900000000002] help me fill in the blanks and because

[136.319 - 141.42] this tool has semantic understanding of

[140.099 - 144.42] what it is that you're trying to achieve

[141.42 - 146.64] and you can explain it it is really good

[144.42 - 149.04] at filling in the information that you

[146.64 - 151.61999999999998] forget so like in this case I was

[149.04 - 152.94] researching um my video on my other

[151.62 - 153.959] channel

[152.94 - 156.239] um and I was talking about the Golden

[153.959 - 158.28] Age of Athens so I was like okay tell me

[156.239 - 159.42000000000002] about the Golden Age of Athens and who

[158.28 - 162.239] are the greatest thinkers because I

[159.42 - 165.66] remembered Socrates Plato Aristotle I

[162.239 - 168.0] forgot Democritus I know Hippocrates

[165.66 - 169.79999999999998] um Pericles lucidities and I was like oh

[168.0 - 171.66] yeah that's right okay cool here's a

[169.8 - 172.86] good list so rather than having you go

[171.66 - 174.84] out to Google and be like who are the

[172.86 - 177.42000000000002] greatest thinkers in the Athenian Golden

[174.84 - 179.81900000000002] Age this already has the context of it

[177.42 - 181.2] knows what I'm doing and it also kind of

[179.819 - 183.23899999999998] already has the right tone and I'm like

[181.2 - 185.76] great give me these people and then we

[183.239 - 188.58] can talk about other aspects so I can

[185.76 - 191.22] already have a very meaningful

[188.58 - 194.76000000000002] um conversation with these uh with this

[191.22 - 196.5] tool let's see if it is going to be done

[194.76 - 198.89999999999998] no I think I have to regenerate okay

[196.5 - 201.78] I'll let it finish regenerating so

[198.9 - 205.08] after taking a step back I realized that

[201.78 - 207.84] it was a um that this is mostly an

[205.08 - 210.3] information needs tool and so this comes

[207.84 - 213.959] from a library and information science

[210.3 - 215.519] which my fiance is a master's degree in

[213.959 - 219.42000000000002] and so this is where I learned it so

[215.519 - 222.78] like Librarians get this we have

[219.42 - 224.45899999999997] information needs all problems are

[222.78 - 225.959] fundamentally and foremost an

[224.459 - 227.34] information problem and so what do I

[225.959 - 229.62] mean by information needs an information

[227.34 - 232.20000000000002] problem well let's see what chat GPT

[229.62 - 234.54] says information needs refers to the

[232.2 - 236.04] information that individuals seek in

[234.54 - 238.2] order to fulfill their personal or

[236.04 - 240.35999999999999] professional goals or to satisfy their

[238.2 - 241.61999999999998] curiosity information needs can range

[240.36 - 243.299] from finding answers to specific

[241.62 - 245.519] questions to acquiring knowledge about a

[243.299 - 247.799] certain topic or event everything that

[245.519 - 249.54] we do in life is aided by information

[247.799 - 251.87900000000002] and so therefore we all have information

[249.54 - 254.28] needs whether it's how to find the right

[251.879 - 255.78] doctor that is information medicines you

[254.28 - 258.359] should take or shouldn't take that is

[255.78 - 260.579] information how to find a job how to do

[258.359 - 261.84] your job how to find friends how to be a

[260.579 - 264.06] better friend how to communicate with

[261.84 - 266.94] relationships everything that we do is

[264.06 - 268.56] an information or is is partially an

[266.94 - 271.32] information need which is why we have

[268.56 - 274.02] such big brains so information needs are

[271.32 - 277.08] Universal and that is why chat gbt and

[274.02 - 278.58] the upcoming being are so useful above

[277.08 - 281.639] and beyond Google

[278.58 - 283.979] or uh old school shirt search as well

[281.639 - 285.72] say so I'll say search so search is

[283.979 - 287.699] about okay I have an information need

[285.72 - 289.32000000000005] let me go find the document and that's

[287.699 - 291.479] basically what Google and other search

[289.32 - 293.52] engines have done is they have figured

[291.479 - 295.5] out how to search billions or trillions

[293.52 - 296.69899999999996] of documents so that you can find the

[295.5 - 299.34] document that you need that's all that

[296.699 - 301.08000000000004] the web is it's a giant decentralized

[299.34 - 302.75899999999996] document server

[301.08 - 304.85999999999996] um and so that's what search is but now

[302.759 - 307.97900000000004] we have a new way of interacting with

[304.86 - 310.44] information the goal has never been

[307.979 - 312.71999999999997] host web pages that was just the method

[310.44 - 315.24] the purpose the Imp the information

[312.72 - 317.58000000000004] Super Highway of the internet is about

[315.24 - 319.56] defining and delivering information and

[317.58 - 321.71999999999997] so large language models give us a new

[319.56 - 323.759] way a fundamentally new way of

[321.72 - 326.46000000000004] interacting with information and so

[323.759 - 328.5] rather than it just being an interface

[326.46 - 331.19899999999996] to connect you to that information it

[328.5 - 333.479] can be a repository and a brand new or a

[331.199 - 337.02000000000004] sorry I didn't say that quite right

[333.479 - 339.419] search was an interface to just connect

[337.02 - 341.46] you to the repository right but now

[339.419 - 344.69899999999996] large language models can be the

[341.46 - 346.979] repository and that is a that is a

[344.699 - 348.84000000000003] fundamental Paradigm Shift they will

[346.979 - 351.12] still like you know Bing sites at

[348.84 - 353.34] sources which is great

[351.12 - 355.38] I think that we're going to end up with

[353.34 - 357.79999999999995] in a new paradigm above and beyond that

[355.38 - 360.539] again this is all brand new this is

[357.8 - 362.46000000000004] rapidly evolving as is my understanding

[360.539 - 365.46] which is why I'm often wrong

[362.46 - 367.44] I have powerful intuition but intuition

[365.46 - 368.82] is fast and if you don't have enough

[367.44 - 370.08] information you go in the wrong

[368.82 - 372.78] direction

[370.08 - 375.24] um it is what it is so information needs

[372.78 - 375.96] that is that is the theory of it all

[375.24 - 378.0] right so now let's talk about

[375.96 - 380.46] information foraging

[378.0 - 382.319] information foraging is a term of art

[380.46 - 385.13899999999995] that comes from library and information

[382.319 - 386.94] science and the definition is it is used

[385.139 - 388.979] to describe the process of seeking and

[386.94 - 390.96] acquiring information just like an

[388.979 - 392.639] animal forages for food this term often

[390.96 - 394.85999999999996] is used in the context of information

[392.639 - 396.12] retrieval and it often refers to the way

[394.86 - 399.0] in which people search for and find

[396.12 - 401.16] information online or offline so

[399.0 - 403.199] information foraging is when you say

[401.16 - 406.08000000000004] okay I have general information needs

[403.199 - 408.36] how do I go find it and in some cases

[406.08 - 411.24] it's kind of passive such as with

[408.36 - 413.759] scrolling on social media right so one

[411.24 - 417.06] of my Chief Information foraging methods

[413.759 - 419.759] is I go to YouTube and um you know the

[417.06 - 421.259] the the stream right it's like okay the

[419.759 - 423.18] algorithm this is a recommendation

[421.259 - 425.819] system this is a type of information

[423.18 - 427.38] foraging YouTube has figured out the

[425.819 - 429.74] kinds of things that I am likely to

[427.38 - 432.24] click on nuclear-powered aircraft

[429.74 - 435.36] Finance it knows that I love the

[432.24 - 437.1] infographic show that I love saving and

[435.36 - 439.86] a bunch of other stuff flight test I

[437.1 - 443.94] love this the Wi-Fi I am a sucker for

[439.86 - 446.46000000000004] some good uh um uh conspiracy theories

[443.94 - 448.56] um and so this is this is what I mean by

[446.46 - 451.68] information forages is I don't know what

[448.56 - 453.84] I'm looking for exactly what is this

[451.68 - 455.479] I really wish I could unsee this this

[453.84 - 458.099] was a failure

[455.479 - 460.139] so they throw in random stuff every now

[458.099 - 461.52] and then that's my excuse because I

[460.139 - 464.88] generally don't click on anything with

[461.52 - 466.79999999999995] Alex Jones or Joe Rogan but there's Joe

[464.88 - 469.02] Rogan again anyways sorry getting

[466.8 - 470.58] sidetracked information foraging where

[469.02 - 471.71999999999997] do you go to look for things that you

[470.58 - 474.539] don't necessarily know what you're

[471.72 - 475.91900000000004] looking for but you have an appetite for

[474.539 - 478.8] information

[475.919 - 480.65999999999997] uh television and radio used to be a

[478.8 - 483.66] good information foraging newspapers

[480.66 - 486.3] these are all tools and methods to

[483.66 - 488.58000000000004] perform information foraging information

[486.3 - 490.38] retrieval refers to the process of

[488.58 - 492.18] locating and retrieving relevant

[490.38 - 493.68] information from a large collection of

[492.18 - 496.199] data such as a database of the internet

[493.68 - 499.919] again search engines this is a type of

[496.199 - 502.259] retrieval but with chat Bots like chat

[499.919 - 503.94] GPT information retrieval is now

[502.259 - 506.099] interactive as if you're basically

[503.94 - 508.02] talking to a librarian and that is

[506.099 - 509.639] basically what Bing does since it cites

[508.02 - 512.2189999999999] its sources

[509.639 - 514.74] information literacy this is a really

[512.219 - 517.1400000000001] critical concept

[514.74 - 519.659] so if you ever know someone who is super

[517.14 - 520.74] gullible like they just read stuff on

[519.659 - 523.56] the internet and believe it all

[520.74 - 526.08] information literacy is one of the best

[523.56 - 529.8] predictors for belief in conspiracy

[526.08 - 532.14] theories for um going into

[529.8 - 533.7199999999999] um various I won't say any specific but

[532.14 - 536.519] the cult-like

[533.72 - 538.86] corners of the internet people with low

[536.519 - 540.42] information literacy basically what this

[538.86 - 543.779] means is they're not able to discern

[540.42 - 545.88] what is a good source of information so

[543.779 - 547.8] information literacy the ability to

[545.88 - 549.72] identify locate evaluate and effectively

[547.8 - 551.04] use information it involves the

[549.72 - 552.5400000000001] development of skills and knowledge that

[551.04 - 554.64] allow individuals to navigate and make

[552.54 - 556.74] use of the information landscape so

[554.64 - 559.62] what's not in what's not specified here

[556.74 - 561.48] is what it's like to not have good

[559.62 - 563.22] information literacy and also to

[561.48 - 565.6800000000001] validate the sources so let me go ahead

[563.22 - 567.6600000000001] and ask this let's talk about

[565.68 - 572.519] information

[567.66 - 578.899] um literacy a bit more what does this

[572.519 - 582.0] um imply how does it intersect with

[578.899 - 583.5] infodemiology and so I have the benefit

[582.0 - 585.42] of I've got a lot of knowledge that I

[583.5 - 586.62] can draw on but if I didn't know how to

[585.42 - 588.54] ask this question it would be really

[586.62 - 591.54] difficult to get to what I'm looking for

[588.54 - 593.399] from chat GPT that is one big difference

[591.54 - 595.62] which is why I also study cognitive

[593.399 - 597.18] architecture because what I want to be

[595.62 - 599.04] able to do is use these large language

[597.18 - 600.8389999999999] model Technologies so that the machine

[599.04 - 603.8389999999999] will be thinking about me and building

[600.839 - 606.12] up a theory of mind or a model of me and

[603.839 - 608.1] then it will be able to anticipate my

[606.12 - 609.72] information needs that is one of the key

[608.1 - 611.94] differences between humans and large

[609.72 - 613.74] language models right now is large

[611.94 - 616.8000000000001] language models can anticipate the next

[613.74 - 618.899] few words but they cannot yet fully

[616.8 - 621.3599999999999] anticipate the information needs of

[618.899 - 622.92] someone they can with the right Framing

[621.36 - 624.6] and maybe I'll do a video on that let me

[622.92 - 626.399] know in the comments if you want a

[624.6 - 628.38] little bit more about theory of mind and

[626.399 - 629.339] anticipation of information needs I

[628.38 - 630.48] think that could be a good thing all

[629.339 - 633.9590000000001] right so let's see what it says about

[630.48 - 636.48] information literacy and infidemiology

[633.959 - 638.6999999999999] okay so it repeats the definition of

[636.48 - 640.86] literacy information literacies are

[638.7 - 643.26] essential for skills uh sorry

[640.86 - 644.94] individuals in the digital age where

[643.26 - 646.74] access to information is easier than

[644.94 - 648.72] ever before however the sheer amount of

[646.74 - 650.6] information can make it challenging to

[648.72 - 653.22] find accurate and relevant information

[650.6 - 656.0400000000001] and to critically evaluate its

[653.22 - 658.38] credibility perfect that is the Core

[656.04 - 661.2199999999999] Essence of information literacy is

[658.38 - 663.779] understanding validity relevance

[661.22 - 665.94] trustworthiness that sort of stuff

[663.779 - 667.62] information literacy and infidemiology

[665.94 - 668.82] intersect and that they both are

[667.62 - 671.76] concerned with the study of information

[668.82 - 673.2] and its impact on society infidemiology

[671.76 - 675.779] is the study of the distribution

[673.2 - 677.6400000000001] determinants and consequences of health

[675.779 - 680.3389999999999] information and misinformation in

[677.64 - 682.019] society this is because of recent world

[680.339 - 684.7790000000001] events that I won't say out loud but you

[682.019 - 686.339] get it you get the idea it seeks to

[684.779 - 688.86] understand how information particularly

[686.339 - 691.86] in the digital age affects public health

[688.86 - 693.48] and well-being infidemiology recognizes

[691.86 - 694.86] the importance of information literacy

[693.48 - 696.899] and ensuring that individuals have the

[694.86 - 699.54] skills to navigate information landscape

[696.899 - 704.399] blah blah blah okay so

[699.54 - 709.14] um uh basically vaccine reluctance as

[704.399 - 711.54] well as anti-masking is our pillars of

[709.14 - 713.48] information literacy and infidemiology

[711.54 - 718.98] okay

[713.48 - 723.4200000000001] now please speculate on the impact of

[718.98 - 727.44] llm and chat Bots like yourself

[723.42 - 731.279] on the uh changing landscape

[727.44 - 734.82] of information needs information uh

[731.279 - 739.32] literacy and information foraging for

[734.82 - 742.1600000000001] instance I am using U to replace

[739.32 - 742.1600000000001] Google search

[742.44 - 746.2790000000001] all right so I asked it to speculate so

[744.42 - 748.5] let's see what it can do it might it

[746.279 - 750.48] might uh dither and say like oh well I'm

[748.5 - 752.76] a language model so I can't but we'll

[750.48 - 754.8000000000001] see what the language model says about

[752.76 - 757.56] language models

[754.8 - 758.88] being used for this in the context of

[757.56 - 760.14] information literacy and information

[758.88 - 762.0] foraging

[760.14 - 764.3389999999999] now is it just me or has it gotten much

[762.0 - 767.1] slower since they uh allowed for um

[764.339 - 770.1600000000001] upgrading to plus I was really concerned

[767.1 - 771.36] that um that because originally it

[770.16 - 773.399] looked like that there was going to be

[771.36 - 774.48] two different levels of quality but it

[773.399 - 775.86] looks like they're not doing that it

[774.48 - 778.019] looks like you get the same model and

[775.86 - 781.04] the same quality it's just much slower

[778.019 - 781.04] if you don't pay

[781.079 - 785.6389999999999] um okay so the rise of language models

[783.779 - 786.8389999999999] like me and chatbots is having a

[785.639 - 787.92] significant impact on the changing

[786.839 - 790.019] landscape

[787.92 - 791.88] um of information needs it doesn't

[790.019 - 794.22] actually know that when it said it said

[791.88 - 795.36] this is having it doesn't it's imagining

[794.22 - 797.0400000000001] that it is

[795.36 - 799.16] um I could tell it that it isn't but

[797.04 - 801.54] it's kind of rolling with the tone

[799.16 - 803.279] information needs information literacy

[801.54 - 806.16] and information foraging here a few ways

[803.279 - 808.32] in which this is happening convenient

[806.16 - 809.6999999999999] access to information chat Bots like

[808.32 - 811.2] myself and language models provide

[809.7 - 812.7] instant and convenient access to

[811.2 - 814.139] information by simply typing a question

[812.7 - 816.9590000000001] individuals can receive a relevant

[814.139 - 818.4590000000001] answer in real time this can help

[816.959 - 820.6199999999999] individuals to quickly fulfill their

[818.459 - 823.0189999999999] information needs and make more informed

[820.62 - 824.88] decisions this was obviously

[823.019 - 826.98] um what wowed everyone about the Bing

[824.88 - 829.38] presentation was that it's like here's

[826.98 - 832.0790000000001] my information problem and not only does

[829.38 - 833.82] it give you often a good answer it will

[832.079 - 835.9799999999999] also cite its sources and then pop those

[833.82 - 838.6800000000001] up to the side saying here's my evidence

[835.98 - 841.32] for this information that I gave you

[838.68 - 843.18] um improved information retrieval

[841.32 - 844.74] language models like myself have been

[843.18 - 846.06] trained on vast amounts of text Data

[844.74 - 847.5] allowing us to provide more

[846.06 - 850.38] comprehensive and accurate answers to

[847.5 - 851.88] users questions sometimes this can make

[850.38 - 853.74] information retrieval faster and more

[851.88 - 855.06] efficient and reduce the time required

[853.74 - 857.94] to find information that that

[855.06 - 860.04] individuals need I will say yes like

[857.94 - 862.2600000000001] Google Foo does anyone remember that

[860.04 - 864.959] some of us got really good at search and

[862.26 - 867.18] rapidly zeroing in on the right

[864.959 - 870.1199999999999] information but this allows the machine

[867.18 - 872.76] to help curate that information very

[870.12 - 876.12] directly let's see enhancing information

[872.76 - 877.8] literacy literacy skills chat box like

[876.12 - 879.54] myself can help individuals to develop

[877.8 - 881.699] their information literacy literacy

[879.54 - 883.3199999999999] skills by providing guidance and support

[881.699 - 885.3599999999999] in evaluating The credibility of

[883.32 - 887.5790000000001] information for example I can provide

[885.36 - 889.62] context and information and explanations

[887.579 - 891.54] for the sources and accuracy of the

[889.62 - 893.4590000000001] information that I provide not really

[891.54 - 895.92] it's making that up

[893.459 - 897.3] um bin can unless they're unless they're

[895.92 - 898.92] doing something in the back end that I'm

[897.3 - 899.76] not aware of but it's not signing in

[898.92 - 902.76] source

[899.76 - 905.519] in theory hypothetically yes

[902.76 - 908.279] um one thing that um uh that that is

[905.519 - 911.22] implied here is that your information

[908.279 - 913.079] literacy is less important if you're

[911.22 - 915.899] interacting with an intelligent machine

[913.079 - 918.42] that it itself has some level of

[915.899 - 921.06] information literacy this is what folks

[918.42 - 922.86] like Sam Altman and Satya Nadella are

[921.06 - 925.56] talking about when they talk about

[922.86 - 928.0790000000001] safety they want to make sure

[925.56 - 929.6389999999999] there's other aspects they they put a

[928.079 - 931.9799999999999] little bit of their own morality into it

[929.639 - 933.24] but more importantly they want to make

[931.98 - 935.82] sure that the information that they're

[933.24 - 937.4590000000001] providing is accurate and verifiable but

[935.82 - 941.7600000000001] this of course opens up

[937.459 - 944.76] excuse me the entire question of uh of

[941.76 - 947.04] of uh who owns the information who gets

[944.76 - 948.779] to determine what truth is and I could

[947.04 - 950.639] do another video on that about uh

[948.779 - 952.139] epistemology

[950.639 - 955.139] um specifically beliefs evidence and

[952.139 - 957.6] consensus or lack thereof

[955.139 - 960.0600000000001] um okay so then changing information

[957.6 - 961.5] foraging Behavior chat box like myself

[960.06 - 963.1199999999999] are changing the way that individuals

[961.5 - 964.5] Forge for information I basically told

[963.12 - 965.82] it that so it's just parroting it back

[964.5 - 966.959] to me

[965.82 - 970.019] um rather than having to search through

[966.959 - 972.2399999999999] multiple websites okay so yeah

[970.019 - 976.199] um this is this this is okay

[972.24 - 978.839] um I'd like you to speculate about how

[976.199 - 981.0] things will change

[978.839 - 985.5] um in the future

[981.0 - 990.44] um speak more broadly about Society uh

[985.5 - 994.639] for instance maybe also work education

[990.44 - 994.639] politics and news

[995.1 - 1001.0400000000001] um yeah let's see what it says here so

[999.12 - 1002.6] uh while it's generating I'll say like

[1001.04 - 1005.06] okay so

[1002.6 - 1006.98] um this this chat here I was uh

[1005.06 - 1009.2589999999999] researching another video where I was

[1006.98 - 1012.74] talking about hunter-gatherers and um

[1009.259 - 1015.1990000000001] and farming and uh the uh caloric

[1012.74 - 1017.24] efficiency of various behaviors also see

[1015.199 - 1018.62] how much faster this is going it's

[1017.24 - 1020.3] interesting that it's so wildly

[1018.62 - 1022.1] inconsistent

[1020.3 - 1023.54] um okay and then I was researching a

[1022.1 - 1025.579] company that wanted to have a that

[1023.54 - 1028.28] wanted to call me I was researching

[1025.579 - 1031.1599999999999] autism I was researching wabi-sabi I was

[1028.28 - 1033.1399999999999] brainstorming uh chapter so this is kind

[1031.16 - 1035.48] of how these chat Bots are kind of

[1033.14 - 1037.16] settling for me obviously people use it

[1035.48 - 1038.66] for different things I'm not using it to

[1037.16 - 1040.3390000000002] make thirty thousand dollars a day like

[1038.66 - 1042.0790000000002] some people are claiming but it is a

[1040.339 - 1044.54] very useful tool

[1042.079 - 1046.1599999999999] let's see work in the future chat Bots

[1044.54 - 1047.959] and language models may play a greater

[1046.16 - 1049.5800000000002] role in the workplace assisting

[1047.959 - 1051.74] employees with tasks such as data

[1049.58 - 1053.4189999999999] analysis customer service and scheduling

[1051.74 - 1055.88] and it's kind of generic boilerplate

[1053.419 - 1057.5590000000002] education in the field of Education have

[1055.88 - 1060.38] the potential to revolutionize the way

[1057.559 - 1063.86] information is delivered and learned yes

[1060.38 - 1065.6000000000001] I am using chatbots for my own

[1063.86 - 1066.9799999999998] information needs

[1065.6 - 1068.4189999999999] um and I think that this is going to

[1066.98 - 1071.1200000000001] continue which means that education

[1068.419 - 1073.4] could really change because of this so I

[1071.12 - 1074.4799999999998] do agree with that politics in the realm

[1073.4 - 1075.919] of politics chat Bots and language

[1074.48 - 1077.66] models may become important tools for

[1075.919 - 1079.94] disseminating information and

[1077.66 - 1081.74] communicating with the public yes this

[1079.94 - 1084.6200000000001] is actually one of the potential uses of

[1081.74 - 1087.6200000000001] my Raven project is to be an interface

[1084.62 - 1090.7399999999998] between you and government whether it's

[1087.62 - 1092.9599999999998] local Municipal state or federal one

[1090.74 - 1095.72] idea is that if you have an information

[1092.96 - 1097.76] concierge or cognitive an autonomous

[1095.72 - 1099.8600000000001] cognitive agent that can be your go

[1097.76 - 1101.6] between between you and the government

[1099.86 - 1103.2199999999998] just a possibility I actually got that

[1101.6 - 1105.3799999999999] idea from other people

[1103.22 - 1108.5] um who think that that is a possibility

[1105.38 - 1110.0590000000002] for the future finally uh news in the

[1108.5 - 1111.5] future chat Bots and language models may

[1110.059 - 1113.96] play a significant role in the way that

[1111.5 - 1115.76] which uh news is delivered and consumed

[1113.96 - 1117.44] for instance individuals may able to use

[1115.76 - 1119.179] chat Bots to receive customized news

[1117.44 - 1120.5] feeds and so on this is actually

[1119.179 - 1122.1200000000001] something that we're talking about in my

[1120.5 - 1124.16] startup one of the things that we want

[1122.12 - 1126.26] to do with Raven is rather than use

[1124.16 - 1128.96] search Reddit or Twitter or anything

[1126.26 - 1131.299] else maybe you can use a chat bot or

[1128.96 - 1133.52] language model or my Raven architecture

[1131.299 - 1135.86] to just have a conversation with the

[1133.52 - 1137.539] news in real about the news in real time

[1135.86 - 1141.26] and then of course it can cite its

[1137.539 - 1143.0] sources and so on but um yeah okay so I

[1141.26 - 1144.559] think this is I think this is a good

[1143.0 - 1146.419] good enough place to stop I just wanted

[1144.559 - 1149.12] to share like okay this is how I'm

[1146.419 - 1151.039] actually using this tool and uh now that

[1149.12 - 1153.08] now that the shiny newness has worn off

[1151.039 - 1155.66] it's like yeah this this is a useful

[1153.08 - 1157.46] tool and it definitely has a place

[1155.66 - 1159.14] um I do a lot less Googling

[1157.46 - 1160.88] I didn't really notice that until other

[1159.14 - 1162.679] people pointed out like oh yeah I don't

[1160.88 - 1164.419] even use Google anymore so no wonder

[1162.679 - 1166.16] Google is panicking

[1164.419 - 1167.66] um but again I think that competition

[1166.16 - 1169.5800000000002] will be good

[1167.66 - 1172.64] um and this is an existential threat for

[1169.58 - 1174.4399999999998] Google uh totally so we'll see how how

[1172.64 - 1177.2800000000002] it plays out anyways thanks for watching

[1174.44 - 1177.28] hope this was helpful
