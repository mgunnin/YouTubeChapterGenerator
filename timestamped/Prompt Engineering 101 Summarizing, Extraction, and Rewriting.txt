[0.96 - 4.88] hey everybody david shapiro here with a

[3.36 - 8.0] video this is going to be another

[4.88 - 9.76] tutorial on prompt engineering today uh

[8.0 - 11.44] so in the first prompt engineering video

[9.76 - 12.639] we talked about davinci which was the

[11.44 - 15.28] original

[12.639 - 17.119] heavy duty model right here da vinci

[15.28 - 18.96] but what today we're going to talk about

[17.119 - 21.119] text davinci o2 which is one of the

[18.96 - 22.96] instruct series models so when i say

[21.119 - 24.24] instruct series models what do i what am

[22.96 - 26.080000000000002] i talking about

[24.24 - 28.32] it's this right here so

[26.08 - 31.839999999999996] january of this year

[28.32 - 34.480000000000004] openai published this blog post about um

[31.84 - 37.2] about their their uh their their

[34.48 - 38.8] instruct series models and all the most

[37.2 - 41.36] popular models today are the text

[38.8 - 44.399] davinci text curie these are all

[41.36 - 47.44] fine-tuned to follow instructions so if

[44.399 - 49.039] you want to follow or to figure this out

[47.44 - 52.0] you can see uh it's right here

[49.039 - 55.28] openai.com blogs instruction following

[52.0 - 57.199] i'll have a link in the comments as well

[55.28 - 59.28] so just a little bit of background about

[57.199 - 61.199] the history of where we're at so the

[59.28 - 63.120000000000005] behavior of text davincio 2 is going to

[61.199 - 65.03999999999999] be very very different from da vinci

[63.12 - 68.479] from plain vanilla da vinci

[65.04 - 71.36000000000001] almond and da vinci instruct beta

[68.479 - 73.76] so the instruct series are fine-tuned um

[71.36 - 75.2] to do quite a few tasks and so i just

[73.76 - 77.68] took a couple quick notes about

[75.2 - 79.04] different kinds of tasks so what we're

[77.68 - 81.759] going to do is i just clicked on one of

[79.04 - 83.759] the random wikipedia articles of the day

[81.759 - 84.88] and i'll just copy this in and this will

[83.759 - 87.36] be our

[84.88 - 88.479] this will be our our fodder for uh for

[87.36 - 92.24] today

[88.479 - 95.119] um so let's start with one task which is

[92.24 - 97.6] uh summarization or paraphrasing

[95.119 - 99.52] um so i'll just say summarize so you

[97.6 - 102.079] need an imperative verb so an imperative

[99.52 - 104.56] verb is a command

[102.079 - 106.63999999999999] a command or imperative tells it what to

[104.56 - 107.84] do that is the instruction so i'll say

[106.64 - 110.32000000000001] summarize

[107.84 - 112.159] the following article and then also

[110.32 - 114.72] let's turn the temperature down to zero

[112.159 - 115.92] so zero makes the model deterministic

[114.72 - 117.52] which means it'll give us the same

[115.92 - 120.32000000000001] output every time so if you change one

[117.52 - 122.32] little thing you'll see a difference

[120.32 - 125.52] so what i do often is i'll do at least

[122.32 - 127.52] two new lines i'll say article

[125.52 - 129.759] so one thing is if you capitalize

[127.52 - 131.68] something it's a different set of tokens

[129.759 - 133.2] um which which kind of tells the model

[131.68 - 134.8] like oh pay attention to this this is

[133.2 - 136.879] not normal language this is not part of

[134.8 - 139.84] the article you can also do stuff like

[136.879 - 142.48] adding you know um those it kind of that

[139.84 - 144.0] can cut sometimes kind of confuse it

[142.48 - 146.0] so then you just say

[144.0 - 150.72] then go to the very end and they say

[146.0 - 150.72] summary and then we'll do control enter

[153.12 - 155.68] all right

[155.76 - 158.16] so

[156.48 - 160.319] you see the irish bee conservation

[158.16 - 161.35999999999999] project is a charitable organization etc

[160.319 - 163.92] etc

[161.36 - 165.519] um so let's just copy this out

[163.92 - 167.04] and i'll save it and then we'll change

[165.519 - 169.20000000000002] one thing at a time and i'll show you

[167.04 - 170.959] what i mean so first let's run it again

[169.2 - 173.599] just just to see

[170.959 - 174.879] that it generates the same exact

[173.599 - 176.56] um

[174.879 - 178.39999999999998] uh

[176.56 - 179.519] output or at least it look

[178.4 - 182.56] no did it do something a little bit

[179.519 - 184.48000000000002] different interesting

[182.56 - 186.64000000000001] yeah it gave me a different output what

[184.48 - 189.44] did i do differently it's supposed to be

[186.64 - 189.44] deterministic

[189.519 - 194.64000000000001] let me run this again

[191.44 - 194.64] did i fat finger something

[196.959 - 199.36] i wonder if i fat fingered something on

[198.319 - 202.56] the first one because this looks

[199.36 - 204.239] identical to the second run

[202.56 - 207.799] let's do it let's do it one more time

[204.239 - 207.799] just to be sure

[212.72 - 216.0] okay that's a little bit different too

[216.239 - 220.959] i wonder if the temperature no longer

[218.319 - 223.599] has the same impact

[220.959 - 224.56] okay this is the same as the first one

[223.599 - 225.92] oops

[224.56 - 228.64000000000001] interesting okay so it seems to be

[225.92 - 231.28] flip-flopping between two outputs okay

[228.64 - 232.95899999999997] so that's slightly unexpected anyways so

[231.28 - 235.04] let's go so we've got that we've got

[232.959 - 236.879] these instructions and we see that it

[235.04 - 238.72] generates um

[236.879 - 240.319] those two things so now let's let's

[238.72 - 241.84] change let's do a summarize the

[240.319 - 244.72] following article

[241.84 - 246.879] very concisely so cons

[244.72 - 249.439] using adjectives modifying the

[246.879 - 250.879] instructions with adjectives will uh

[249.439 - 253.84] will change the output so then we'll

[250.879 - 255.35999999999999] just say concise summary so this word

[253.84 - 257.519] activates

[255.36 - 259.519] different parts of the gpd3 model that

[257.519 - 261.68] it says okay what does concise mean it

[259.519 - 264.32] means make it smaller so now let's see

[261.68 - 267.52] the temperature is still zero

[264.32 - 269.199] so let's see see how much shorter it is

[267.52 - 270.12] uh and we'll run this a couple times so

[269.199 - 273.759] we have

[270.12 - 274.72] 829 characters versus 298.

[273.759 - 276.0] um

[274.72 - 277.28000000000003] oops

[276.0 - 279.04] control

[277.28 - 281.11999999999995] z redo

[279.04 - 282.639] and the the first bit is is almost

[281.12 - 284.96] identical right

[282.639 - 287.04] you see that where it just adds more so

[284.96 - 288.4] basically telling it to be concise cut

[287.04 - 289.759] it off at the knees

[288.4 - 292.63899999999995] um

[289.759 - 292.639] let's run it again

[293.759 - 297.36] looks like it's pretty much identical

[295.28 - 299.28] yep okay so telling it to be concise

[297.36 - 300.88] that does one thing now

[299.28 - 302.63899999999995] what if we what if we take the

[300.88 - 304.08] temperature and turn it up to one so

[302.639 - 305.84000000000003] this is how i learned all this stuff is

[304.08 - 308.4] i just said okay let me just i've got

[305.84 - 310.08] this i've got this little panel of of

[308.4 - 311.67999999999995] knobs and levers let me just experiment

[310.08 - 312.96] with them and see what happens so now

[311.68 - 316.16] that the temperature is up to one we're

[312.96 - 316.15999999999997] going to see a lot more variants

[318.32 - 322.479] oh it still has concise so it actually

[320.56 - 324.639] gave me the same output

[322.479 - 326.4] so i'll have to remove concise yeah

[324.639 - 328.639] that's the same same output all right so

[326.4 - 331.52] let's remove concise summary

[328.639 - 333.84000000000003] uh summarize the following article

[331.52 - 335.44] and also it's one thing is that's

[333.84 - 337.19899999999996] important to keep in mind is that this

[335.44 - 339.199] is a fine-tuned model so its output is

[337.199 - 340.32] going to be much more consistent in

[339.199 - 344.40000000000003] general

[340.32 - 344.4] than um ordinary davinci

[344.88 - 350.08] oh interesting okay

[347.44 - 352.08] so this is one problem with uh with the

[350.08 - 354.88] instruct series is that they do tend to

[352.08 - 358.88] be a little bit more deterministic

[354.88 - 358.88] or less less random

[360.24 - 363.039] there we go

[361.36 - 365.52000000000004] so this gave us a completely different

[363.039 - 366.8] um different output also part of the

[365.52 - 369.19899999999996] problem is that this is a is a

[366.8 - 370.40000000000003] relatively short or um not organization

[369.199 - 371.759] uh article

[370.4 - 373.12] which means that there's not a whole lot

[371.759 - 374.72] to do okay

[373.12 - 376.0] you get the idea we've done a little bit

[374.72 - 376.96000000000004] of summarization let's move on to

[376.0 - 378.8] another

[376.96 - 381.52] whoops cancel that

[378.8 - 383.28000000000003] um let's see classification

[381.52 - 384.639] rewriting

[383.28 - 386.23999999999995] i'm not sure if there's any

[384.639 - 388.8] classification that we can do with this

[386.24 - 391.12] however there is a lot of keyword

[388.8 - 396.24] extraction named entity recognition and

[391.12 - 397.52] dates um so let's see uh perform

[396.24 - 398.479] any r

[397.52 - 400.0] uh

[398.479 - 402.479] and um

[400.0 - 406.16] and date extraction

[402.479 - 409.919] on the following article

[406.16 - 411.28000000000003] and so then we say list all named

[409.919 - 413.52] entities

[411.28 - 416.0] and dates

[413.52 - 418.15999999999997] and then one thing i often do is because

[416.0 - 419.919] i want it to be a list i'll just i'll go

[418.16 - 421.36] to the new line and start with a dash

[419.919 - 423.28] because that is like a final little

[421.36 - 424.96000000000004] thing that says this is the list because

[423.28 - 426.0] sometimes the model will get confused

[424.96 - 429.44] and it'll just describe it as a

[426.0 - 432.0] paragraph it's like no give me a list

[429.44 - 432.0] there we go

[433.039 - 436.24] hey not bad

[434.56 - 438.96] so it gives me beltane living earth

[436.24 - 443.36] festival southeast technology instrument

[438.96 - 444.79999999999995] university 21st baron of dunsini

[443.36 - 447.36] um i could have sworn there was some

[444.8 - 449.52000000000004] dates in here there's 2020

[447.36 - 452.08000000000004] 2021

[449.52 - 453.52] so it missed a few dates but that's okay

[452.08 - 454.71999999999997] if we turn the well i'm not going to

[453.52 - 455.68] worry about the temperature you've seen

[454.72 - 457.28000000000003] you've seen that there's different

[455.68 - 459.28000000000003] things that it can do

[457.28 - 462.15999999999997] but it did do a good job of extracting

[459.28 - 465.11999999999995] name entities and dates

[462.16 - 467.03900000000004] let's see what else can we do

[465.12 - 469.039] let's go back to my list um

[467.039 - 471.68] brainstorming rewriting classification

[469.039 - 471.68] oh here we go

[471.84 - 476.15999999999997] rewrite the following

[474.24 - 477.28000000000003] wikipedia

[476.16 - 478.639] article

[477.28 - 479.599] um

[478.639 - 482.319] uh

[479.599 - 484.639] so that it's more interesting

[482.319 - 486.8] from a uh

[484.639 - 488.72] let's see so it's more interesting for

[486.8 - 491.039] um an online

[488.72 - 491.03900000000004] um

[491.52 - 494.31899999999996] news article

[496.639 - 501.28000000000003] so then uh

[498.96 - 502.87899999999996] rewrite to be interesting

[501.28 - 504.15999999999997] and so you know you might you might your

[502.879 - 505.759] intuition might be like well a machine

[504.16 - 507.03900000000004] doesn't know what interesting is the

[505.759 - 508.879] machine doesn't need to understand what

[507.039 - 511.12] interesting really means all it has to

[508.879 - 512.719] do is match the pattern of what what it

[511.12 - 514.08] has read in hundreds of gigabytes of

[512.719 - 517.08] other text of what humans find

[514.08 - 517.08] interesting

[521.12 - 524.9590000000001] look at this this is great copy

[526.64 - 529.6] and then if it cut off because the

[528.08 - 530.64] maximum length so let's let it finish

[529.6 - 534.6] its article

[530.64 - 534.6] it's probably just about done

[536.24 - 540.32] yeah so in this case you can see it's

[538.72 - 542.88] pretty similar

[540.32 - 546.08] um but it has expanded on a lot of the

[542.88 - 547.92] stuff quite a bit um

[546.08 - 550.72] in some cases it's kind of just

[547.92 - 552.24] regurgitating what it what it um what it

[550.72 - 555.279] read up top

[552.24 - 557.279] um but it has definitely adopted um

[555.279 - 560.08] slightly new formats rewarded it just a

[557.279 - 561.76] little bit um to make it a a bit more

[560.08 - 563.279] interesting a little a little less dry

[561.76 - 565.279] and academic

[563.279 - 566.32] so rewriting is is another thing that it

[565.279 - 568.399] can do

[566.32 - 569.6800000000001] um let's see

[568.399 - 572.32] let's see rewrite the following

[569.68 - 573.3599999999999] wikipedia article so that it is

[572.32 - 578.72] let's say

[573.36 - 578.72] so it is more accessible to children

[578.88 - 582.64] so then let's come here rewrite

[583.44 - 586.839] for children

[594.24 - 597.92] so you see it's it's

[596.32 - 600.1600000000001] still got really similar

[597.92 - 601.5999999999999] information but instead of like pillars

[600.16 - 603.8389999999999] of support it just says there are four

[601.6 - 607.0400000000001] things the charity does to help bees so

[603.839 - 608.5600000000001] the language has been simplified um and

[607.04 - 611.4399999999999] and some of the some of the irrelevant

[608.56 - 613.1199999999999] details have been have been removed um

[611.44 - 615.44] let's see let's see rewrite the

[613.12 - 617.44] following wikipedia article

[615.44 - 620.0] let's just do something off the wall um

[617.44 - 621.12] in esperanto

[620.0 - 622.8] um

[621.12 - 624.9590000000001] let's see if it knows esperanto it might

[622.8 - 626.079] not rewrite

[624.959 - 629.079] in

[626.079 - 629.079] esperanto

[632.399 - 636.16] i have no idea if that's actually

[633.519 - 636.16] esperanto

[641.76 - 648.48] um it did something okay cool

[644.959 - 652.2399999999999] um let's see and uh in oh what is it

[648.48 - 655.24] there's um bbc was it bbc pigeon

[652.24 - 655.24] um

[661.12 - 664.88] i'm pretty sure

[662.48 - 666.48] they're like bbc has like a section that

[664.88 - 667.8389999999999] is

[666.48 - 670.24] now okay

[667.839 - 670.24] um

[672.64 - 675.8389999999999] oh wait hang on

[679.36 - 684.88] let's see let's say a west african

[681.92 - 684.88] um pigeon

[686.0 - 691.12] so basically what i'm remembering sorry

[688.0 - 693.44] i kind of trailed off is uh bbc started

[691.12 - 693.44] um

[693.68 - 697.5999999999999] yeah there it is okay so it does

[695.36 - 699.36] understand pidgin so this is like a kind

[720.56 - 725.1999999999999] saying rewrite um so

[723.519 - 726.72] one thing is in that's interesting is if

[726.72 - 730.32] for whatever reason gpth3 often gets

[728.56 - 732.399] confused when you say translate but if

[730.32 - 734.1600000000001] you tell it to rewrite it says okay i'm
