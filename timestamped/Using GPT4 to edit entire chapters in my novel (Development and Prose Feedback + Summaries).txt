[0.78 - 6.48] hey gang David Shapiro here introducing

[3.6 - 10.139] a new repo that I'm working on

[6.48 - 12.420000000000002] so this is uh as many of you are aware

[10.139 - 15.299] I've been working with fiction and

[12.42 - 18.6] language models for quite a while

[15.299 - 20.22] um and this one is uh my chapter

[18.6 - 22.5] summarizer

[20.22 - 24.358999999999998] so what does it do I can't show you the

[22.5 - 26.58] end result because it's private it's for

[24.359 - 28.32] for my novel but you're welcome to run

[26.58 - 30.598999999999997] it yourself and you can also test it in

[28.32 - 34.86] the playground if you've got access to

[30.599 - 39.3] the chat API and gpt4 it will not work

[34.86 - 41.04] anywhere else because of the um and

[39.3 - 42.98] actually it might only work with the API

[41.04 - 47.76] I haven't actually tried it in here

[42.98 - 50.16] but the gpt4 API will give you 8 000

[47.76 - 52.079] tokens which if you write longer

[50.16 - 54.059] chapters like I do which is four to five

[52.079 - 55.14] thousand words you need that 8 000

[54.059 - 58.559] tokens

[55.14 - 60.3] and so the idea though is I wanted a way

[58.559 - 63.78] to get really good feedback really

[60.3 - 68.03999999999999] quickly and I tried for months and

[63.78 - 70.979] months with the 4000 token limit and if

[68.04 - 74.06] you summarizing the chapter could work

[70.979 - 74.06] but not always

[74.1 - 79.08] um and so anyways the final result is

[75.96 - 81.29899999999999] now that I've got access to the gpt4 API

[79.08 - 83.82] I just created this and suddenly

[81.299 - 86.34] everything is infinite excuse me

[83.82 - 87.65899999999999] infinitely easier kind of hiccups

[86.34 - 90.659] um but yeah so let me walk you through

[87.659 - 93.06] this um I do have instructions here

[90.659 - 95.04] um but yeah so what you'll need to do is

[93.06 - 97.56] you'll need to create your API key here

[95.04 - 101.52000000000001] and then you'll also need to create your

[97.56 - 104.10000000000001] folders here so the um the chapters dot

[101.52 - 109.79899999999999] doc so put all of your chapters in here

[104.1 - 112.02] as word docs and then uh this this Pi uh

[109.799 - 114.78] Powershell script will summer or sorry

[112.02 - 117.119] convert them to text then that'll

[114.78 - 119.399] they'll end up here and then finally you

[117.119 - 120.18] run the second one to summarize and it

[119.399 - 122.64] will

[120.18 - 126.119] um jump drop the summaries here

[122.64 - 128.88] uh so the the the the linchpin of this

[126.119 - 130.8] is this prompt here so this is this is

[128.88 - 132.9] the primary thing that you're trying to

[130.8 - 134.16000000000003] achieve please write an executive

[132.9 - 135.9] summary of the following chapter

[134.16 - 138.42] followed by a list of the most Salient

[135.9 - 140.16] details from the chapter saline details

[138.42 - 141.78] should include uh chapter development

[140.16 - 143.819] plot advancement important World

[141.78 - 145.44] building details and any thematic

[143.819 - 148.79999999999998] elements those are the four primary

[145.44 - 150.12] pillars of good fiction of well all

[148.8 - 152.04000000000002] stories

[150.12 - 154.31900000000002] um please write the list of details in

[152.04 - 156.54] complete sentences next please provide

[154.319 - 158.04] some developmental feedback what is the

[156.54 - 159.9] one biggest thing wrong with this

[158.04 - 162.0] chapter what is the first and biggest

[159.9 - 164.76000000000002] thing I need to work on as the author

[162.0 - 166.56] finally please provide prose feedback by

[164.76 - 170.22] focusing on the dialogue Exposition

[166.56 - 172.92000000000002] interiority action and I should actually

[170.22 - 175.739] change this to description

[172.92 - 177.29999999999998] um sorry you should avoid Exposition if

[175.739 - 179.04] you can

[177.3 - 181.86] um but description is good

[179.04 - 184.07999999999998] uh so I made that mistake there so

[181.86 - 187.20000000000002] anyways the first script is super simple

[184.08 - 189.36] it just passes in its Powershell because

[187.2 - 190.98] if you're using Microsoft Word you can

[189.36 - 193.14000000000001] do this part manually too if you want

[190.98 - 195.599] like if you're if you're writing your

[193.14 - 197.7] your chapter somewhere else you can copy

[195.599 - 201.23899999999998] them out to text files doesn't matter

[197.7 - 204.78] but for this draft I am doing it all as

[201.239 - 208.019] one chapter per Word document

[204.78 - 210.239] um just for cleanliness sake

[208.019 - 212.64000000000001] um and that's what this does so it'll

[210.239 - 214.92000000000002] drop it all here into chapters text and

[212.64 - 217.44] then I run the second script which is

[214.92 - 218.099] really really straightforward

[217.44 - 221.22] um

[218.099 - 223.73899999999998] all it does is in the main Loop we set

[221.22 - 227.459] the API key we get the chapters

[223.739 - 228.72] underscore text we get the summaries if

[227.459 - 231.36] it doesn't make it it'll make the

[228.72 - 233.099] directory for you which is nice

[231.36 - 235.799] um and then what it does so here's a

[233.099 - 237.959] couple things to to pay attention to

[235.799 - 240.959] um if the if the program barfs in the

[237.959 - 243.12] middle you don't want to redo everything

[240.959 - 245.94] um so it'll it'll skip it if it's

[243.12 - 247.26] already been summarized so then it'll

[245.94 - 250.5] tell you the file that it's reading

[247.26 - 253.5] it'll open the chapter it will populate

[250.5 - 256.56] the prompt right here and then it will

[253.5 - 259.38] create the conversation so as of right

[256.56 - 260.94] now gpt4 is only available at the chat

[259.38 - 263.52] completion endpoint I don't I think

[260.94 - 266.4] they're moving away from from the

[263.52 - 269.58] original completions endpoint entirely I

[266.4 - 271.79999999999995] don't know but anyways so I give it the

[269.58 - 273.0] the system role is I'm a fiction writing

[271.8 - 274.62] assistant who will always provide

[273.0 - 277.62] thorough professional and detailed help

[274.62 - 280.38] it's pretty pretty straightforward you

[277.62 - 282.6] can probably play with this if you want

[280.38 - 286.919] um especially if you wanted to take some

[282.6 - 289.02000000000004] elements of the instructions out but uh

[286.919 - 291.24] you know there's there's been some like

[289.02 - 293.03999999999996] in some of the documentation it says

[291.24 - 294.90000000000003] that it doesn't pay as much attention to

[293.04 - 298.02000000000004] the system message

[294.9 - 301.13899999999995] um as the as the user message so what I

[298.02 - 302.58] do is I have the I just have this so it

[301.139 - 305.1] knows that I am a fiction writing

[302.58 - 306.65999999999997] assistant okay great and then I I put

[305.1 - 308.58000000000004] the prompt in

[306.66 - 311.16] um and because I'm using the gpt4

[308.58 - 314.639] endpoint with 8 000 tokens it can read

[311.16 - 316.97900000000004] the entire uh chapter so then I get the

[314.639 - 318.66] summary and then I save out the summary

[316.979 - 320.639] it is that simple it's brain dead simple

[318.66 - 322.8] now there's a couple other things that I

[320.639 - 324.6] added so

[322.8 - 327.0] um the first time I ran this it ended up

[324.6 - 330.12] failing because of

[327.0 - 333.78] um error rate or uh usage rates so gpt4

[330.12 - 336.3] is presently super super constrained and

[333.78 - 337.55999999999995] so what I did was I added an exponential

[336.3 - 340.32] back off

[337.56 - 343.08] so that if you get an error the first

[340.32 - 345.9] time it'll wait five seconds then 10

[343.08 - 349.19899999999996] seconds then 20 and so on and I have it

[345.9 - 350.58] uh it'll retry up to six times

[349.199 - 352.979] um waiting longer and longer between

[350.58 - 354.65999999999997] each time after I Incorporated this I

[352.979 - 357.06] didn't have any trouble

[354.66 - 358.97900000000004] um but that you know it is what it is

[357.06 - 362.46] um another thing that I had to modify

[358.979 - 364.86] was for whatever reason converting from

[362.46 - 366.78] word doc to text

[364.86 - 369.18] um still produce some UTF errors on

[366.78 - 371.63899999999995] occasion on only like a couple files so

[369.18 - 373.62] I added the ignore here so but here's

[371.639 - 377.699] the thing is gpt3 doesn't care if you've

[373.62 - 380.46] got a couple of erroneous characters the

[377.699 - 382.199] big thing is that um oh actually I

[380.46 - 385.38] didn't include it here

[382.199 - 388.319] um was the force ASCII in code decode

[385.38 - 390.65999999999997] but it haven't had any trouble since so

[388.319 - 393.12] I think that's it

[390.66 - 396.36] um yeah and here let me go back to the

[393.12 - 397.86] repo oh so a couple other things like I

[396.36 - 399.66] said I'm not sure if it'll work here

[397.86 - 401.28000000000003] because I look at the maximum length of

[399.66 - 402.6] 2048

[401.28 - 405.539] um so I don't think that they're giving

[402.6 - 407.52000000000004] you the full 8 000 tokens here

[405.539 - 409.56] um so I don't I don't think you can

[407.52 - 412.08] actually test it in the playground but

[409.56 - 413.759] also this is expensive so I had to

[412.08 - 417.06] restart it a few times so it's actually

[413.759 - 418.62] about half this but half my novel or

[417.06 - 420.84] just over half my novel cost about

[418.62 - 423.539] somewhere between four and eight dollars

[420.84 - 425.039] to review

[423.539 - 427.259] um which in the grand scheme of things

[425.039 - 428.88] is hella cheap because it's like four

[427.259 - 430.68] dollars who cares

[428.88 - 432.65999999999997] um but then you compare that to like you

[430.68 - 434.639] know some of the other tasks that you

[432.66 - 437.94] guys have seen me do it cost me 43 cents

[434.639 - 439.8] right so because of the volume of the

[437.94 - 441.3] text that it's reading it is a lot more

[439.8 - 443.46000000000004] expensive

[441.3 - 446.759] um still it's way cheaper than a full

[443.46 - 448.85999999999996] editor now that being said I added some

[446.759 - 451.74] some notes here at the end because I

[448.86 - 454.819] paid a high-end Editor to help me with

[451.74 - 456.96000000000004] my story and that experience was still

[454.819 - 459.12] worthwhile even though it was like

[456.96 - 461.94] Seventeen hundred dollars I paid a human

[459.12 - 464.4] to read it and to understand what I was

[461.94 - 465.71999999999997] what I was trying to achieve now that

[464.4 - 469.67999999999995] being said

[465.72 - 472.259] once Jeep once we get the 32 000 token

[469.68 - 475.08] um endpoint which I I haven't tested

[472.259 - 478.139] that yet or you know as fast as it's

[475.08 - 481.25899999999996] ramping up because 32 000 is eight times

[478.139 - 483.3] more than the four thousand token so who

[481.259 - 485.88] knows by the end of the summer we might

[483.3 - 489.3] be at 300 000 tokens which is more than

[485.88 - 491.039] enough to read an entire novel right so

[489.3 - 494.099] I don't know what's going to happen to

[491.039 - 496.02] the professional editing industry nor

[494.099 - 498.96] the fiction industry I think we're going

[496.02 - 502.02] to end up with a lot of books out there

[498.96 - 503.87899999999996] um but anyways it is what it is so

[502.02 - 506.69899999999996] um yeah it provides some developmental

[503.879 - 511.199] feedback as well as Pros feedback so

[506.699 - 513.539] when I was using chat gbt to work on the

[511.199 - 514.74] um Cornelia valyria storied my Ascension

[513.539 - 517.8] novel

[514.74 - 520.08] after I got the first chapter written

[517.8 - 522.659] um which I deleted that video because it

[520.08 - 525.36] was a hot mess but the thing that I

[522.659 - 526.8] realized was that asking chat GPT what

[525.36 - 529.5600000000001] is the biggest problem with this chapter

[526.8 - 532.019] is actually the best way to to get it to

[529.56 - 534.3599999999999] give you developmental feedback because

[532.019 - 535.62] there's usually going to be only one big

[534.36 - 537.54] problem

[535.62 - 540.48] um but also you can only focus on one

[537.54 - 542.519] problem at a time right so like you know

[540.48 - 545.04] say for instance your chapter is

[542.519 - 547.08] otherwise fine maybe it has some issues

[545.04 - 549.5999999999999] but it just doesn't have enough tension

[547.08 - 551.76] you need to fix that problem first and

[549.6 - 553.6800000000001] then see what comes next you actually

[551.76 - 555.42] can't solve more than one problem at a

[553.68 - 557.399] time and therefore it's an iterative

[555.42 - 558.959] process

[557.399 - 561.42] um and then finally I also have it give

[558.959 - 563.9399999999999] you some prose feedback just to make

[561.42 - 565.1999999999999] sure that at the at the line level that

[563.94 - 567.12] you're doing a good job because those

[565.2 - 569.519] are kind of two different Scopes so

[567.12 - 571.2] it'll give you a summary uh an executive

[569.519 - 574.5] summary a list of salient details

[571.2 - 577.1400000000001] developmental feedback and um and prose

[574.5 - 578.76] feedback all in one go it works pretty

[577.14 - 582.48] well

[578.76 - 587.16] um yeah so I think that's about it uh

[582.48 - 589.6800000000001] the it's up here on MIT license

[587.16 - 592.459] um yeah I guess I'll stop it there let

[589.68 - 592.459] me know what you guys think
