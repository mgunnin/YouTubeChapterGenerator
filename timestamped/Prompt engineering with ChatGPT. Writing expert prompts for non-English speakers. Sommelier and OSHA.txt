[0.659 - 7.5] hey everybody David Shapiro here with a

[3.24 - 9.96] more uh conventional video so

[7.5 - 11.7] um on my patreon

[9.96 - 13.259] um and throughout all of my time on

[11.7 - 16.858999999999998] YouTube one of the questions that I get

[13.259 - 19.8] the most is uh with prompt engineering

[16.859 - 23.340000000000003] and one thing that I've noticed is that

[19.8 - 25.32] uh many folks

[23.34 - 28.68] um are are working on prompt engineering

[25.32 - 31.198999999999998] and in some cases English is not their

[28.68 - 33.42] first language and so this video is

[31.199 - 34.800000000000004] going to be primarily for people who for

[33.42 - 38.28] whom English is not your first language

[34.8 - 40.44] and so for instance In some cultures

[38.28 - 43.86] you're more likely to use the passive

[40.44 - 47.059] voice so this is particularly for

[43.86 - 49.739] um for uh folks from India and Japan

[47.059 - 51.539] where you kind of insinuate what you

[49.739 - 53.519999999999996] need and and the the reason is because

[51.539 - 56.64] in these cultures it's considered

[53.52 - 59.52] impolite or rude to be direct but that

[56.64 - 63.18] being said these models and these models

[59.52 - 65.4] I mean gpt3 and chat GPT they're trained

[63.18 - 66.84] with a western mindset and so what I'm

[65.4 - 69.60000000000001] what I mean by that is that they

[66.84 - 73.02000000000001] responded to imperatives to commands and

[69.6 - 74.39999999999999] if you're a Spanish speaker bandatos so

[73.02 - 75.89999999999999] that's actually where I originally kind

[74.4 - 77.10000000000001] of learned that concept is like oh it's

[75.9 - 80.10000000000001] a command word

[77.1 - 82.74] uh or or a imperative sentence or um

[80.1 - 84.17999999999999] that sort of thing so what I what I have

[82.74 - 85.55999999999999] started telling people

[84.18 - 89.759] uh if you're not a native English

[85.56 - 91.86] speaker use chat GPT to to get the

[89.759 - 94.08] intent across and to write it in in good

[91.86 - 96.42] English but you need to understand that

[94.08 - 99.119] imperative so you say write instructions

[96.42 - 101.93900000000001] not like you know uh the chatbot should

[99.119 - 104.1] write this blah blah you know you got to

[101.939 - 106.979] be direct so I got a couple of examples

[104.1 - 108.72] and so and and these are inspired by by

[106.979 - 112.67999999999999] questions that I've actually gotten so

[108.72 - 116.1] in one write product reviews for uh for

[112.68 - 118.97900000000001] some uh wine given some basic facts so

[116.1 - 120.96] let's ask chat gbt uh are you familiar

[118.979 - 124.579] with

[120.96 - 124.579] uh prompt engineering

[124.979 - 132.12] and so what I'm doing here is I am

[129.119 - 135.72] uh priming this conversation so the chat

[132.12 - 137.28] GPT knows what it is that we're doing so

[135.72 - 138.72] it's like okay I understand the concept

[137.28 - 140.7] of prompt engineering that's what we're

[138.72 - 141.84] working on

[140.7 - 143.819] cool

[141.84 - 145.379] and so that's that's it I just needed

[143.819 - 147.0] that information in the context window

[145.379 - 151.14] so that that way it knows what we're

[147.0 - 154.2] about to do cool uh help me write a

[151.14 - 155.099] DaVinci prompt for

[154.2 - 160.26] um

[155.099 - 165.35999999999999] uh for writing uh wine uh descriptions

[160.26 - 171.54] for an online uh store

[165.36 - 176.18] um my database has a few uh Fields

[171.54 - 178.64] um such as year location type of wine

[176.18 - 182.16] flavor profile

[178.64 - 183.66] bouquet I think I spelled that right and

[182.16 - 188.599] so on

[183.66 - 190.879] um we need a prompt that

[188.599 - 195.72] will write

[190.879 - 195.72] incredibly vivid descriptions

[196.019 - 198.08] um

[198.12 - 205.5] for each wine

[200.58 - 209.84] um they should be flowery or romantic

[205.5 - 212.879] um or even sultry in some cases

[209.84 - 214.68] where appropriate

[212.879 - 217.26] um

[214.68 - 218.4] for instance uh

[217.26 - 222.29899999999998] like

[218.4 - 226.44] imagine that the description

[222.299 - 229.37900000000002] is written by a professional French

[226.44 - 231.68] sommelier

[229.379 - 231.67999999999998] um okay

[231.92 - 240.0] can you take a crack at that prompt so

[237.54 - 242.64] what we do is that for for iterative

[240.0 - 244.379] purposes because you have no idea what

[242.64 - 245.45899999999997] it's going to do

[244.379 - 247.56] um

[245.459 - 249.42000000000002] there we go there we go so this is

[247.56 - 252.18] actually off to a great start so all I

[249.42 - 254.51899999999998] did was I described the prompt and so

[252.18 - 256.32] let me unpack what I did here so I said

[254.519 - 257.94] write a DaVinci prompt for me I'm

[256.32 - 259.68] assuming that chat GPT knows what

[257.94 - 260.28] DaVinci is

[259.68 - 262.139] um

[260.28 - 264.35999999999996] I don't know if it does but it's being

[262.139 - 265.86] constantly updated so who knows but it

[264.36 - 268.02000000000004] does say open AI DaVinci so it did

[265.86 - 270.0] connect that DaVinci is from openai Okay

[268.02 - 271.02] cool so chat GPT knows how to write

[270.0 - 272.759] prompts

[271.02 - 275.34] all right so as of professional French

[272.759 - 277.259] sommelier write a captivating ooh ooh I

[275.34 - 279.96] like that captivating description of a

[277.259 - 281.52000000000004] year type of wine from location so these

[279.96 - 284.03999999999996] are the placeholders with flavor profile

[281.52 - 286.32] and Bouquet transport the reader to the

[284.04 - 288.06] vineyard and let them savor every sip oh

[286.32 - 292.02] that is good

[288.06 - 295.34] um example so then uh as a

[292.02 - 298.08] this that and the other okay so it gave

[295.34 - 300.06] this as

[298.08 - 301.979] okay so this this is basically going to

[300.06 - 304.08] be a few shot right so we're saying

[301.979 - 305.0] here's an example

[304.08 - 309.53999999999996] um

[305.0 - 312.18] yep so we need to fill in the blanks for

[309.54 - 313.86] this for the few shot okay

[312.18 - 315.18] so let me let me slow down because I

[313.86 - 318.12] know that I'm going really fast so what

[315.18 - 321.0] it did was it produced here's the prompt

[318.12 - 324.06] right and then here is an example of how

[321.0 - 326.22] it would look right and so we'll need to

[324.06 - 328.919] do a little bit of formatting

[326.22 - 330.72] um and and this is get basically like so

[328.919 - 333.24] I'm going to tell it let's use this as a

[330.72 - 335.94000000000005] few shot example so we can get exactly

[333.24 - 338.0] the the behavior that we want

[335.94 - 338.0] um

[338.28 - 342.65999999999997] tantalizing creation as a friend as a

[341.039 - 344.21999999999997] professional French sommelier I invite

[342.66 - 346.02000000000004] you to do blah blah

[344.22 - 347.40000000000003] um okay so what's what's wrong with this

[346.02 - 349.5] we don't want it to say as a

[347.4 - 355.13899999999995] professional French sommelier

[349.5 - 356.4] um this is a good start but we don't

[355.139 - 360.72] want

[356.4 - 364.5] um the response to open with as a

[360.72 - 370.8] professional French sommelier

[364.5 - 372.86] um the user will probably uh not care

[370.8 - 372.86] um

[376.039 - 382.56] instead let's

[378.479 - 384.0] um write the prompt in such a way that

[382.56 - 384.74] it uses

[384.0 - 388.02] um

[384.74 - 389.40000000000003] uh uses a kind of a

[388.02 - 391.62] third

[389.4 - 395.88] perspective

[391.62 - 397.259] so for instance it will reply or it will

[395.88 - 400.139] say

[397.259 - 400.97900000000004] this bottle will

[400.139 - 402.96000000000004] um

[400.979 - 404.58] transport you

[402.96 - 409.44] make sense

[404.58 - 412.68] um can you try a slightly modified

[409.44 - 416.06] version of this prompt

[412.68 - 416.06] sure here's a modified version

[418.74 - 425.0] okay now it's getting confused

[422.34 - 425.0] hmm

[425.699 - 430.979] so now that's that's not what I was

[427.44 - 436.199] looking for no that's not what I was

[430.979 - 436.86] looking for let's start over

[436.199 - 441.599] um

[436.86 - 444.84000000000003] let's just write the prompt let's adopt

[441.599 - 446.819] a new format where

[444.84 - 449.63899999999995] the opening

[446.819 - 454.62] prompt is labeled

[449.639 - 461.12] as prompt in your response and then the

[454.62 - 461.12] completion is also labeled with all caps

[462.78 - 471.0] so the prompt should include

[466.28 - 475.85999999999996] the Persona of a sommelier but the most

[471.0 - 481.38] important thing is to write the Vivid

[475.86 - 483.72] description of the wine based upon the

[481.38 - 486.86] input variables

[483.72 - 486.86] try again please

[488.52 - 491.18] there we go

[492.12 - 495.78000000000003] all right so it says write a captivating

[494.28 - 497.34] wine description

[495.78 - 499.979] from the perspective of a French

[497.34 - 502.21999999999997] sommelier for a year blah blah blah okay

[499.979 - 502.21999999999997] cool

[502.5 - 504.979] um yeah

[505.319 - 510.72] this is pretty simple so one thing I

[508.199 - 512.94] will say is that less is often more

[510.72 - 514.44] so you see how this prompt got shorter

[512.94 - 516.899] and shorter

[514.44 - 518.58] we should actually try this this is

[516.899 - 522.12] pretty simple

[518.58 - 526.62] um so it may work can you

[522.12 - 530.839] fill in the variables for me so I can

[526.62 - 530.839] try it and then what we're going to do

[533.1 - 536.399] from Napa Valley with a buttery flavor

[534.899 - 538.14] profile that hints of vanilla and Oak

[536.399 - 539.399] okay cool

[538.14 - 541.74] um so what we're going to do is we're

[539.399 - 544.64] going to actually take this

[541.74 - 544.64] platform

[544.86 - 548.1800000000001] and we're gonna um

[549.36 - 553.38] description so we're going to actually

[550.86 - 554.76] see what it does now I lately I turned

[553.38 - 556.2] the temperature down to zero because I

[554.76 - 558.66] want to see what the model produces

[556.2 - 562.94] without any variance

[558.66 - 562.9399999999999] um let's see 250 that's probably enough

[564.12 - 569.1] it's a truly Exquisite wine blah blah

[567.0 - 571.5] blah

[569.1 - 573.9590000000001] okay so now what I can do is I can take

[571.5 - 575.519] this output and say I liked this output

[573.959 - 578.18] but I was hoping it would be a little

[575.519 - 578.18] bit more

[578.22 - 583.44] so this output is good but I'd like for

[581.22 - 584.7] it to be a little bit longer okay

[583.44 - 588.36] great

[584.7 - 589.9200000000001] um I tried it and got the following

[588.36 - 592.04] output

[589.92 - 592.04] um

[593.94 - 600.1800000000001] so this is really great

[597.12 - 602.22] but I'd like to add

[600.18 - 603.12] a bit about

[602.22 - 607.64] um

[603.12 - 612.6] when and where this wine would be good

[607.64 - 618.3199999999999] please update modify expand the prompt

[612.6 - 623.88] so that it will include uh stuff like

[618.32 - 625.6800000000001] food pairings but also really engage

[623.88 - 627.24] the users

[625.68 - 632.399] um not user

[627.24 - 636.839] the uh wine uh buyers imagination

[632.399 - 639.899] they need to know exactly how they're

[636.839 - 641.1] going to use this wine going to use this

[639.899 - 642.66] wine

[641.1 - 648.4200000000001] all right

[642.66 - 651.24] so now please write a new new prompt

[648.42 - 652.279] um with this in mind

[651.24 - 657.5] um

[652.279 - 657.5] the last one was pretty good

[662.72 - 667.14] okay

[664.44 - 668.7] cool excellent

[667.14 - 672.56] and I just hit Escape because I don't

[668.7 - 675.12] need it like chat GPT is hallucinating

[672.56 - 676.6199999999999] what the output might be and that's fine

[675.12 - 679.68] because it's like it gives you an idea

[676.62 - 683.579] of but then you need to test it okay

[679.68 - 686.64] great can you uh fill in the blanks fill

[683.579 - 689.4799999999999] in the variables of that last prompt so

[686.64 - 689.48] I can test

[689.579 - 693.06] excuse me

[691.98 - 695.04] okay

[693.06 - 696.8389999999999] so then we'll grab this and come back

[695.04 - 700.38] over here

[696.839 - 702.7790000000001] Okay so

[700.38 - 704.76] um describe how this wine can be enjoyed

[702.779 - 706.14] what dishes it pairs well with and how

[704.76 - 708.74] it will enhance the overall dining

[706.14 - 708.74] experience

[710.66 - 715.8] is a truly captivating wine

[714.24 - 717.36] um it's fruity flavor is balanced by

[715.8 - 719.04] floral bouquet making a delightful

[717.36 - 721.019] complex experience on the palette you'll

[719.04 - 723.5999999999999] find notes of ripe cherries raspberries

[721.019 - 726.5] and hints of spice cool I don't know if

[723.6 - 726.5] it's lying but okay

[726.779 - 730.14] um Pinot Noir pairs wonderfully with a

[728.579 - 732.2399999999999] variety of dishes from light salads to

[730.14 - 734.519] heartier fair is fruity notes make it a

[732.24 - 736.5] great companion accompaniment sorry to

[734.519 - 738.3] grilled salmon or roasted chicken

[736.5 - 740.519] there you go

[738.3 - 743.3389999999999] um experience sure to enhance any dining

[740.519 - 746.1] experience it's complexity and balance

[743.339 - 748.86] make it a great choice for any occasion

[746.1 - 751.8000000000001] um cool so I was at the grocery store

[748.86 - 754.5] with my fiance and there was um there

[751.8 - 756.3] was a brand of wine that was like you

[754.5 - 757.14] know it was it was very sultry it was

[756.3 - 760.74] like

[757.14 - 762.8389999999999] um uh like you know the the delicate

[760.74 - 764.519] velvet on your lips is sure to like

[762.839 - 766.2600000000001] basically turn you on

[764.519 - 768.72] um so what we want to do now is we want

[766.26 - 773.459] to add one final variable so that the um

[768.72 - 775.2] whoever's writing this can um add a tone

[773.459 - 778.7399999999999] um great

[775.2 - 782.4590000000001] great that worked uh really well

[778.74 - 783.6] um let's add one last variable to The

[782.459 - 788.279] Prompt

[783.6 - 793.26] um I want my users Wine sellers

[788.279 - 798.42] to be able to specify a tone

[793.26 - 801.56] so for instance some Shoppers are going

[798.42 - 806.399] to be very uh haughty

[801.56 - 808.079] and serious about their wine so we need

[806.399 - 808.68] to

[808.079 - 812.399] um

[808.68 - 816.4799999999999] create a variable that will allow for

[812.399 - 817.44] that but some wine brands are going to

[816.48 - 818.5790000000001] be

[817.44 - 820.86] um

[818.579 - 824.8199999999999] to be sillier

[820.86 - 829.519] or um basically just eight or two

[824.82 - 834.3000000000001] different audiences so can you

[829.519 - 836.279] modify the prompt one last time to

[834.3 - 838.079] include

[836.279 - 841.639] a um

[838.079 - 841.6389999999999] uh uh uh

[841.98 - 846.38] target audience tone

[844.56 - 849.66] kind of thing

[846.38 - 854.48] I'm not sure the

[849.66 - 854.48] best way to modify the prompt

[855.12 - 859.5] okay let's see what it does so chat GPT

[857.279 - 861.0] is pretty smart

[859.5 - 862.8] um

[861.0 - 864.06] tailored for a specific

[862.8 - 865.4399999999999] no

[864.06 - 867.42] um

[865.44 - 869.6600000000001] let's see that's not what I was looking

[867.42 - 869.66] for

[872.54 - 879.12] no that's not good uh you removed

[877.2 - 881.82] the bit about

[879.12 - 883.26] food pairings

[881.82 - 886.5790000000001] and such

[883.26 - 886.579] bring that back

[886.8 - 890.24] so let's see um

[890.82 - 898.62] let's bring that back um just modify

[893.699 - 900.3599999999999] this following prompt by adding a new

[898.62 - 903.5] tone variable

[900.36 - 903.5] or something like that

[907.68 - 911.9399999999999] all right I apologize for the confusion

[909.839 - 912.62] it's very uh recalcitrant is that the

[911.94 - 915.6] word

[912.62 - 917.4590000000001] contrite Contrition okay write a

[915.6 - 919.0790000000001] captivating review blah blah blah tailor

[917.459 - 922.2199999999999] the tone for a specific audience no

[919.079 - 922.2199999999999] you're not using the tone

[923.699 - 934.9799999999999] you did not add a tone variable you just

[930.959 - 939.66] you just rambled off the list of tones I

[934.98 - 941.1] suggested as possible variables

[939.66 - 943.68] so it might sound like I'm being really

[941.1 - 945.48] rude to the machine right now

[943.68 - 948.4799999999999] um

[945.48 - 952.639] there we go so now we've got this all

[948.48 - 952.639] right so let's add this to our prompt

[954.42 - 958.4399999999999] tailor the tone

[956.399 - 961.139] of the description to a specific tardy

[958.44 - 963.5400000000001] Audience by using the variable uh that's

[961.139 - 964.98] like really well let's see if it works

[963.54 - 967.019] let's see if it works I I might be

[964.98 - 968.4590000000001] jumping to conclusions

[967.019 - 970.44] um

[968.459 - 972.959] so we'll say something like target

[970.44 - 973.639] audience tone is going to be

[972.959 - 976.4399999999999] um

[973.639 - 978.1800000000001] uh let's see

[976.44 - 979.74] young 20 something

[978.18 - 984.019] [Music]

[979.74 - 984.019] um women okay cool

[988.339 - 993.98] no

[989.94 - 993.98] that didn't work laughs

[994.399 - 998.22] you don't advertise to Young

[996.42 - 1000.199] 20-something women by saying you're a

[998.22 - 1002.0600000000001] young 20-something woman

[1000.199 - 1004.959] um

[1002.06 - 1004.959] yeah that didn't work

[1005.8 - 1009.74] that's kind of funny

[1008.36 - 1011.3000000000001] um all right so let's use let's use more

[1009.74 - 1013.4590000000001] adjectives

[1011.3 - 1015.74] because in this case it's like the the

[1013.459 - 1016.699] model is like very

[1015.74 - 1020.36] um

[1016.699 - 1021.8599999999999] Let's do let's do uh fun and silly

[1020.36 - 1024.919] all right

[1021.86 - 1026.179] it's a fun and silly wine

[1024.919 - 1029.5590000000002] no

[1026.179 - 1029.5590000000002] super not what I want

[1029.66 - 1032.38] all right

[1032.48 - 1038.0] okay I tried this and

[1036.079 - 1042.26] uh it is

[1038.0 - 1042.26] an unmitigated disaster

[1045.38 - 1050.38] prompt

[1047.6 - 1050.3799999999999] completion

[1056.059 - 1060.559] what do you think is wrong with this

[1059.6 - 1065.98] prompt

[1060.559 - 1065.98] got any ideas how to fix it

[1069.38 - 1072.0390000000002] foreign

[1075.74 - 1078.28] okay

[1083.48 - 1089.38] why don't we try changing the line

[1095.72 - 1101.96] this seems off

[1098.48 - 1105.4] and we simplify this

[1101.96 - 1105.4] um part of the prompt

[1114.559 - 1117.94] removed the variable again

[1119.05 - 1122.51] [Laughter]

[1124.22 - 1129.2] and then it says tailor the tone okay

[1126.86 - 1131.32] the best fits your brand

[1129.2 - 1131.32] um

[1134.179 - 1138.8600000000001] all right let's see it's clear that you

[1137.6 - 1139.6399999999999] are lost

[1138.86 - 1142.4799999999998] um

[1139.64 - 1142.48] foreign

[1143.179 - 1152.419] remember that a prompt is static so

[1147.5 - 1155.799] including a description or a a line in

[1152.419 - 1155.7990000000002] the prompt like

[1157.46 - 1161.679] um does not make any sense

[1165.2 - 1170.26] can you try something completely

[1167.9 - 1170.26] different

[1176.48 - 1181.58] there we go tailor the tone for the

[1179.6 - 1184.6599999999999] description of your target audiences

[1181.58 - 1184.6599999999999] like no

[1186.38 - 1191.24] now you're completely lost

[1188.96 - 1192.6200000000001] okay this is getting aggravating

[1191.24 - 1195.44] actually

[1192.62 - 1196.58] um uh okay because what I'm trying to do

[1195.44 - 1198.98] is I'm trying to show you how to get

[1196.58 - 1201.799] chat EBT to do this but Chad GPT is

[1198.98 - 1203.059] obviously not

[1201.799 - 1207.26] um getting it

[1203.059 - 1207.86] so remember simpler is better

[1207.26 - 1210.02] um

[1207.86 - 1210.8799999999999] stop with the

[1210.02 - 1212.4189999999999] um

[1210.88 - 1213.919] ludicrously

[1212.419 - 1214.46] long

[1213.919 - 1217.24] um

[1214.46 - 1217.24] prompt

[1217.52 - 1220.6399999999999] just use

[1219.2 - 1224.6200000000001] a simple

[1220.64 - 1224.6200000000001] tone variable please

[1229.58 - 1235.34] okay it doesn't get it

[1232.58 - 1237.3799999999999] uh it really really doesn't get it

[1235.34 - 1240.1999999999998] um all right so here's how I would do it

[1237.38 - 1242.179] and I apologize but I hope as we we

[1240.2 - 1244.299] found out we found a limit

[1242.179 - 1244.299] um

[1245.059 - 1250.0] tone of the description

[1246.919 - 1250.0] fun and silly

[1254.419 - 1257.26] there we go

[1257.44 - 1262.16] this is what I was trying to get it to

[1259.52 - 1264.32] do and I was like simpler is better

[1262.16 - 1267.799] um so then we say

[1264.32 - 1268.76] um so then we say like uh let's see

[1267.799 - 1272.78] um

[1268.76 - 1272.78] uh let's see luxurious

[1273.44 - 1280.1200000000001] and sensual

[1276.2 - 1280.1200000000001] this is for the the snoo to your clients

[1280.58 - 1285.3999999999999] just said it's a luxurious and Central

[1282.559 - 1285.3999999999999] experience okay whatever

[1287.36 - 1292.6399999999999] it's not perfect but you can see we made

[1289.28 - 1295.3999999999999] some progress all right so let's move on

[1292.64 - 1296.7800000000002] to a different prompt altogether so OSHA

[1295.4 - 1298.4] this is actually one that I've gotten

[1296.78 - 1300.44] several questions

[1298.4 - 1302.0590000000002] um about over the years

[1300.44 - 1303.26] um and it's about like regulations and

[1302.059 - 1306.34] stuff

[1303.26 - 1306.34] so let's delete this

[1306.919 - 1318.679] um let's see help me write a uh Da Vinci

[1312.799 - 1321.559] um gpt3 prompt for uh citing

[1318.679 - 1326.3600000000001] OSHA regulations

[1321.559 - 1330.86] um given an employee complaint

[1326.36 - 1332.12] can you take a crack at this

[1330.86 - 1335.74] um

[1332.12 - 1340.1789999999999] label the prompt with prompt and

[1335.74 - 1340.179] completion with completion

[1341.48 - 1345.26] all right you're an HR representative

[1342.919 - 1347.96] for a Manufacturing Company an employee

[1345.26 - 1351.08] has filed a complaint

[1347.96 - 1354.679] um okay no

[1351.08 - 1358.28] all right good start but we need a

[1354.679 - 1361.3600000000001] placeholder in the prompt for the

[1358.28 - 1361.36] employee complaint

[1366.679 - 1368.679] um

[1370.28 - 1376.58] um the employee complaint

[1373.46 - 1378.559] should not be in line with the

[1376.58 - 1379.22] description

[1378.559 - 1382.3999999999999] um

[1379.22 - 1384.88] think of it more like a form the

[1382.4 - 1384.88] complaint

[1384.98 - 1393.14] may be a sentence or a whole paragraph

[1390.2 - 1396.22] so create some additional

[1393.14 - 1396.22] framing for it

[1403.22 - 1409.88] no I don't like that use new lines to

[1407.96 - 1412.1000000000001] frame the complaint

[1409.88 - 1415.8400000000001] better remember

[1412.1 - 1415.84] write it more like a form

[1417.5 - 1420.28] there we go

[1420.799 - 1425.36] okay cool

[1422.9 - 1426.0800000000002] great now let's

[1425.36 - 1430.34] um

[1426.08 - 1436.539] imagine an employee complaint for

[1430.34 - 1441.08] testing can you imagine a an employee

[1436.539 - 1443.299] complaint let's say realistic

[1441.08 - 1447.26] realistic employee complaint

[1443.299 - 1449.86] um on a warehouse floor involving a

[1447.26 - 1449.86] forklift

[1451.4 - 1459.5800000000002] no don't include the prompt

[1454.64 - 1459.5800000000002] just write the complaint only

[1463.1 - 1466.6399999999999] on several occasions I've witnessed

[1464.78 - 1469.3999999999999] forklifts after driving at excessive

[1466.64 - 1472.2800000000002] speeds such as honking the horn before

[1469.4 - 1473.96] not following okay

[1472.28 - 1478.58] cool

[1473.96 - 1480.559] cool now let's rewrite this with broken

[1478.58 - 1481.82] English

[1480.559 - 1486.26] um

[1481.82 - 1489.2] imagine that the employee is not a

[1486.26 - 1490.52] native English speaker

[1489.2 - 1493.9] so we're basically going to write this

[1490.52 - 1493.9] prompt to see if it is resilient

[1494.96 - 1498.44] and not follow safety cool this is

[1496.94 - 1501.0800000000002] dangerous for me please do something to

[1498.44 - 1503.8400000000001] fix now now to fix thank you cool great

[1501.08 - 1505.76] so let's try this

[1503.84 - 1507.3799999999999] um all right you are an HR

[1505.76 - 1509.24] representative

[1507.38 - 1511.46] so let's come back over here

[1509.24 - 1514.52] employee complaint

[1511.46 - 1516.6200000000001] and let's grab the complaint

[1514.52 - 1519.2] and my brother and I lived in an

[1516.62 - 1521.539] apartment like 15 years ago uh maybe not

[1519.2 - 1523.76] that long ago but the uh the the the

[1521.539 - 1525.26] neighborhood handyman actually wrote

[1523.76 - 1527.299] like this

[1525.26 - 1529.46] um and he was very helpful very sweet

[1527.299 - 1531.799] guy but just did not have a good command

[1529.46 - 1533.8400000000001] of English and you imagine that that

[1531.799 - 1536.74] many people who work dangerous jobs are

[1533.84 - 1536.74] not native English speakers

[1537.2 - 1540.919] okay so

[1540.02 - 1542.4189999999999] um

[1540.919 - 1547.2990000000002] whoops

[1542.419 - 1547.2990000000002] OSHA response let's see what it says

[1553.52 - 1556.179] okay

[1556.34 - 1560.779] all right cool

[1558.08 - 1564.86] I tested the um

[1560.779 - 1567.26] The Prompt and complaint

[1564.86 - 1571.3999999999999] but it uh

[1567.26 - 1573.919] did not cite any specific

[1571.4 - 1577.96] OSHA regulations

[1573.919 - 1577.96] um it just gave me

[1579.2 - 1584.419] a generic list of steps

[1582.74 - 1585.5] um

[1584.419 - 1591.3200000000002] foreign

[1585.5 - 1595.7] this prompt is meant to give internal HR

[1591.32 - 1598.52] a list of regulations to look up for

[1595.7 - 1601.4] reference can you

[1598.52 - 1603.74] can you modify the prompt

[1601.4 - 1607.0590000000002] um to list only

[1603.74 - 1607.059] OSHA regulations

[1616.76 - 1621.679] okay it's still it's still saying and

[1620.48 - 1623.059] outline the steps that we're going to

[1621.679 - 1625.159] take but I don't think that that's what

[1623.059 - 1628.48] we want it to do

[1625.159 - 1628.48] so let's grab this

[1635.659 - 1640.0390000000002] let's see and it just parroted this back

[1637.7 - 1642.46] at me

[1640.039 - 1642.46] um yep

[1642.62 - 1650.84] no we don't want to um

[1647.24 - 1655.299] give the response to the employee

[1650.84 - 1659.0] so remove the bit about steps will take

[1655.299 - 1664.36] remember the entire point of this is

[1659.0 - 1664.36] just to list OSHA regulations

[1665.659 - 1671.9] please rewrite the entire prompt from

[1669.5 - 1673.279] the beginning actually here here's what

[1671.9 - 1674.779] we're going to do

[1673.279 - 1677.6] um this is this is another Advanced

[1674.779 - 1679.34] technique which is um you ask it to to

[1677.6 - 1682.36] summarize everything that we're doing so

[1679.34 - 1687.039] far can you recap and summarize

[1682.36 - 1687.039] everything we're doing

[1694.58 - 1698.48] not quite

[1696.2 - 1700.88] take a big step back

[1698.48 - 1703.72] what are we doing here

[1700.88 - 1703.72] zoom out

[1704.779 - 1708.2] we are creating a prompt and an employee

[1706.58 - 1710.24] complaint for an HR representative at a

[1708.2 - 1713.98] Manufacturing Company involving unsafe

[1710.24 - 1713.98] working conditions blah blah okay

[1715.34 - 1719.98] yep good good good okay

[1718.64 - 1725.14] now

[1719.98 - 1725.14] describe the goal of the prompt

[1729.14 - 1735.679] wrong

[1730.82 - 1740.059] we are not replying to the uh employee

[1735.679 - 1744.1000000000001] we are only generating OSHA citations

[1740.059 - 1744.1] for HR to investigate

[1746.0 - 1748.9] say regulations

[1752.12 - 1757.3999999999999] can you restate the purpose

[1755.179 - 1759.5590000000002] of the prompt

[1757.4 - 1761.0] now and so when you do this when you ask

[1759.559 - 1762.62] it like wait tell me what you're

[1761.0 - 1765.399] thinking then you can see the

[1762.62 - 1765.399] misunderstanding

[1769.34 - 1772.34] there we go

[1771.26 - 1776.539] great

[1772.34 - 1782.9189999999999] now please write a brand new prompt

[1776.539 - 1782.919] that accepts the uh employ the complaint

[1783.44 - 1787.48] and sites regulations

[1795.46 - 1802.0] stop with the steps that the company

[1799.34 - 1802.0] will take

[1803.6 - 1808.84] we are not doing that

[1806.36 - 1808.84] foreign

[1814.039 - 1822.17] that is not even the same prompt no

[1818.66 - 1822.17] [Laughter]

[1826.76 - 1829.72] there we go

[1829.76 - 1833.779] I didn't actually know if that would

[1831.62 - 1836.6] work

[1833.779 - 1841.039] okay cool

[1836.6 - 1844.1789999999999] let's see if this works

[1841.039 - 1844.179] employee complaint

[1848.299 - 1851.86] and then whoops

[1851.899 - 1857.02] instead of Osha response I probably need

[1853.88 - 1857.0200000000002] to say OSHA regulations

[1862.159 - 1867.1000000000001] whoa I wonder if these are right

[1863.779 - 1867.1] probably not

[1872.539 - 1877.039] powered industrial trucks

[1875.059 - 1881.0] I'll be darned

[1877.039 - 1881.0] oh cool

[1881.72 - 1887.5] um let's see we're looking for 178

[1884.899 - 1887.5] oh

[1888.14 - 1891.039] loading

[1891.14 - 1894.5200000000002] I'll be darned okay

[1894.62 - 1899.26] so now let's try this let's remove this

[1903.799 - 1907.24] and see if it still knows

[1911.899 - 1915.4399999999998] I'll be darned

[1913.34 - 1917.4189999999999] okay so even when I removed it it still

[1915.44 - 1919.94] knows the regulations

[1917.419 - 1924.14] I think we can call this a victory

[1919.94 - 1926.419] damn I'm actually impressed okay

[1924.14 - 1928.46] um yeah because one thing that a lot of

[1926.419 - 1930.5590000000002] people mistake is that uh the model

[1928.46 - 1931.7] already knows a lot so you need to see

[1930.559 - 1933.6789999999999] if the model already has that

[1931.7 - 1935.3600000000001] information and this video is getting

[1933.679 - 1937.279] long we're already at 30 minutes so I

[1935.36 - 1939.5] think we'll call it a day we'll maybe do

[1937.279 - 1940.7] chat bot prompting in the future but uh

[1939.5 - 1943.12] I hope you found this valuable thanks

[1940.7 - 1943.1200000000001] for watching
