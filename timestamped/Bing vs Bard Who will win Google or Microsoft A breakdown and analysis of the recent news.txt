[0.84 - 7.62] morning everybody David Shapiro here

[3.12 - 10.379999999999999] with a breakdown so yesterday we had

[7.62 - 13.2] Microsoft with their Bing announcement

[10.38 - 17.46] and demonstration and this morning we

[13.2 - 20.039] had Google with Bard and then some so

[17.46 - 22.14] uh let's break this down uh in case you

[20.039 - 25.740000000000002] haven't seen it yet uh there was a nice

[22.14 - 28.740000000000002] little demo of of Bing where you can ask

[25.74 - 31.619] about uh you know getting a dog and then

[28.74 - 33.96] you basically get a chat GPT like output

[31.619 - 36.899] but it does cite its sources which is

[33.96 - 38.399] really cool so I get the impression that

[36.899 - 39.899] there's a little bit more going on

[38.399 - 42.6] behind the scenes where they're probably

[39.899 - 45.36] doing uh integrating search results and

[42.6 - 46.620000000000005] citing their sources as they go which is

[45.36 - 49.62] really good

[46.62 - 52.86] um having using the internet as a source

[49.62 - 54.059] of declarative knowledge good on you

[52.86 - 55.44] um there's still going to be gaps in

[54.059 - 57.059] this but we don't have to take a deep

[55.44 - 61.379] dive into that so

[57.059 - 62.64] uh if you get on it you can expand it uh

[61.379 - 64.86] I don't know I don't know how broadly

[62.64 - 66.96000000000001] available this is yet uh of course it's

[64.86 - 69.6] also just the first release it's going

[66.96 - 71.39999999999999] to be improved over time uh but as an

[69.6 - 73.91999999999999] initial showing it's like okay cool this

[71.4 - 76.58000000000001] is basically chat GPT directly in your

[73.92 - 80.58] browser with citations sorted or

[76.58 - 84.9] citations uh provided rather not sorted

[80.58 - 87.6] um now today though Google had their

[84.9 - 91.68] expected announcement of Bard but they

[87.6 - 95.33999999999999] went above and beyond so they had a lot

[91.68 - 97.97900000000001] on visual search with Google Lens as

[95.34 - 99.78] well as Google Maps both of those are

[97.979 - 103.14] roughly the same kind of thing where

[99.78 - 106.02] it's about being in the real world and

[103.14 - 110.159] more visual data Google immersive view

[106.02 - 112.56] in maps looks incredible so they use a

[110.159 - 115.56] new technology called Nerf or a neural

[112.56 - 118.2] Radiance field there's a great video on

[115.56 - 119.57900000000001] this from corridor through which I

[118.2 - 121.02] definitely recommend you check out I

[119.579 - 124.02] think it was about four two or two to

[121.02 - 126.719] four months ago anyways uh I told a

[124.02 - 128.28] friend of mine uh about six or seven

[126.719 - 129.72] months ago that that neural

[128.28 - 131.58] representations were going to be the way

[129.72 - 133.8] of the future we were talking about deep

[131.58 - 136.20000000000002] fakes and then neural Radiance Fields

[133.8 - 138.0] come out which is basically I think that

[136.2 - 140.879] neural Radiance fields are going to

[138.0 - 145.92] completely change the way that we do

[140.879 - 147.66] movies uh film TV uh it it's interactive

[145.92 - 150.0] as well so this could change the way

[147.66 - 152.94] that we do games I think the future is

[150.0 - 154.8] neural representations and Google nailed

[152.94 - 156.599] it they stuck The Landing with the

[154.8 - 159.59900000000002] immersive view on maps you can actually

[156.599 - 161.29999999999998] go in and walk through in in fully

[159.599 - 163.73899999999998] rendered 3D

[161.3 - 165.72] any locations that they have with the

[163.739 - 167.81900000000002] neural Radiance fields

[165.72 - 170.4] um and then they had this uh these

[167.819 - 173.33999999999997] little opera singing blobs uh for their

[170.4 - 174.84] their arts and culture aspect and uh

[173.34 - 176.58] we'll get it will get a little bit more

[174.84 - 180.12] into this in the future but I also think

[176.58 - 183.12] that we are seeing the very beginning of

[180.12 - 186.06] AI generated entertainment

[183.12 - 189.06] um the combination of generative AI in

[186.06 - 192.659] in the form of large language models uh

[189.06 - 194.879] uh text image text to video uh text

[192.659 - 197.519] audio in this case these these opera

[194.879 - 199.26] singers are all completely synthesized

[197.519 - 202.019] um and then also neural representations

[199.26 - 203.7] for interactive aspects such as neural

[202.019 - 205.37900000000002] Radiance Fields when we'll get a little

[203.7 - 207.54] bit more into that

[205.379 - 208.85999999999999] um with a with a nice little Hidden Gem

[207.54 - 210.48] at the end of the video so stick around

[208.86 - 211.92000000000002] until the end

[210.48 - 212.7] um where I talk about where this is

[211.92 - 214.55999999999997] going

[212.7 - 217.79999999999998] Okay so

[214.56 - 220.5] I uh I did a little poll I did one on

[217.8 - 222.72] Twitter and YouTube uh now there is

[220.5 - 225.299] obviously some bias in this because uh

[222.72 - 228.54] people that follow me are more likely to

[225.299 - 231.84] uh see this poll and reply but on both

[228.54 - 234.659] platforms Google was chosen as the clear

[231.84 - 239.34] winner uh of this fight

[234.659 - 241.56] um with 70 on on YouTube and 62 on

[239.34 - 244.379] Twitter now I have way fewer followers

[241.56 - 247.31900000000002] on Twitter so this is probably a more

[244.379 - 249.29899999999998] fair representation whereas uh my

[247.319 - 253.07999999999998] followers on YouTube are going to be

[249.299 - 254.76000000000002] familiar with uh uh some of my prior

[253.08 - 257.1] prior beliefs around cognitive

[254.76 - 258.419] architecture and so on which is why I

[257.1 - 261.47900000000004] favor Google

[258.419 - 264.96] uh if I were a betting man now

[261.479 - 267.78] um so General consensus seems to be that

[264.96 - 271.44] Google has about a two to one uh

[267.78 - 272.82] advantage over Microsoft with Bing we'll

[271.44 - 275.94] be curious to see how these numbers

[272.82 - 277.259] change after today I suspect this is

[275.94 - 278.639] going to tip a little bit more in the

[277.259 - 280.91900000000004] favor of Google

[278.639 - 282.96000000000004] uh one thing that came up in this poll

[280.919 - 283.88] though was that a bunch of folks were

[282.96 - 287.4] saying

[283.88 - 288.84] we are going to see a paradigm shift in

[287.4 - 291.84] the way that we approach the internet

[288.84 - 293.34] and web and and so on and I've I've had

[291.84 - 295.5] people recommend all kinds of things

[293.34 - 297.35999999999996] like we're going to see a new layer of

[295.5 - 299.22] abstraction where instead of websites

[297.36 - 301.32] we're going to have a different uh you

[299.22 - 302.88000000000005] know like the chat or another kind of

[301.32 - 305.34] way of interacting with the internet

[302.88 - 307.74] we're going to have entirely new AI

[305.34 - 310.79999999999995] experiences uh there's going to be a

[307.74 - 312.3] third party an underdog maybe an open

[310.8 - 316.32] source solution

[312.3 - 318.12] so there is some energy around hey maybe

[316.32 - 321.24] AI is going to completely change the

[318.12 - 322.919] landscape I'm not sure that I am in that

[321.24 - 325.08] camp just yet because when you look at

[322.919 - 326.69899999999996] the people that are best equipped to

[325.08 - 328.38] adapt to this change it's going to be

[326.699 - 330.78000000000003] the ones that are one leading the

[328.38 - 333.24] research and two have the money to Pivot

[330.78 - 336.17999999999995] and Microsoft and Google have both of

[333.24 - 338.699] those in Spades remember that it was

[336.18 - 340.62] Google who started this with their paper

[338.699 - 343.199] their original papers on Transformers

[340.62 - 344.34000000000003] back in what 2016

[343.199 - 345.6] um and that has led to the current

[344.34 - 348.25899999999996] Revolution

[345.6 - 350.52000000000004] uh so they've been here for years

[348.259 - 352.91900000000004] Microsoft is technically still playing

[350.52 - 354.539] catch-up although open AI is a little

[352.919 - 356.52] bit ahead you know but in the grand

[354.539 - 358.199] scheme of things Microsoft and Google

[356.52 - 360.35999999999996] are neck and neck in this technology

[358.199 - 362.82] they're they're leading the charge and

[360.36 - 365.16] setting the tone so I think that they

[362.82 - 368.639] are probably going to be the preeminent

[365.16 - 370.8] uh players when it comes to Ai and

[368.639 - 372.24] neural networks and particularly search

[370.8 - 374.40000000000003] as well as some of these other

[372.24 - 377.039] Technologies uh such as the digital

[374.4 - 378.84] avatars and so and and and voice and

[377.039 - 382.68] image generation

[378.84 - 384.539] now I did however start another poll

[382.68 - 388.74] based on some of those responses because

[384.539 - 391.62] I was curious uh is search toast maybe

[388.74 - 394.199] they're on to something maybe we will

[391.62 - 396.84000000000003] see the death of conventional search

[394.199 - 399.36] through you know your search bar it

[396.84 - 401.21999999999997] could entirely be that search is going

[399.36 - 403.62] the way of the dinosaurs after all

[401.22 - 406.08000000000004] younger younger folks these days gen Z

[403.62 - 408.84000000000003] they're more likely to use tick tock to

[406.08 - 410.81899999999996] search which that still blows my mind

[408.84 - 413.75899999999996] um you know because it's like Tick Tock

[410.819 - 415.68] is a Chinese platform that is designed

[413.759 - 416.699] to be addictive I don't know why you

[415.68 - 418.919] would want to use that for information

[416.699 - 421.44] foraging purposes

[418.919 - 423.06] um but hey it is what it is

[421.44 - 425.52] um so

[423.06 - 428.52] anyways the results here were mixed now

[425.52 - 431.75899999999996] to be fair there's only 162 votes total

[428.52 - 434.28] between these two but they are opposite

[431.759 - 436.86] between Twitter and YouTube so

[434.28 - 440.81899999999996] search is here forever roughly 50 50

[436.86 - 443.16] with searches toasted maybe we will see

[440.819 - 445.62] a paradigm shift where people are just

[443.16 - 447.59900000000005] not going to use search anymore imagine

[445.62 - 450.539] you know people there's already people

[447.599 - 453.0] using replica uh their chat bot imagine

[450.539 - 455.15999999999997] that you have an app on your phone that

[453.0 - 457.86] is your personal information concierge

[455.16 - 460.08000000000004] and all you do is chat with that that's

[457.86 - 462.18] honestly what I want I don't want to

[460.08 - 464.88] cruise Reddit which is going to give me

[462.18 - 466.919] you know depressing information and doom

[464.88 - 469.56] scrolling I want to have a meaningful

[466.919 - 472.44] conversation with an intelligent entity

[469.56 - 474.06] that can tell me like the no one knows

[472.44 - 476.16] what I care about like you know nuclear

[474.06 - 478.8] fusion and mRNA and Rejuvenation

[476.16 - 480.66] therapies and Singularity and AI I want

[478.8 - 483.0] to have something that goes and finds

[480.66 - 484.44] the information that I want and hand

[483.0 - 487.199] delivers it to me and can have a

[484.44 - 489.419] conversation now Google News already

[487.199 - 492.06] does that I get most of my news by

[489.419 - 494.69899999999996] swiping um swiping left on my Android

[492.06 - 496.44] phone and it has a curated news feed

[494.699 - 499.319] that is already pretty well custom

[496.44 - 502.199] tailored to what I want to know about

[499.319 - 503.879] so you slap Google barred on that and

[502.199 - 506.099] that is going to be the primary way that

[503.879 - 508.91900000000004] I interact with the internet so it's an

[506.099 - 510.65999999999997] it is possible that search is going the

[508.919 - 514.4399999999999] way of the dinosaurs search as we know

[510.66 - 516.3000000000001] it obviously search is still there but

[514.44 - 517.62] maybe there is something to this idea

[516.3 - 519.7189999999999] that we're going to have another layer

[517.62 - 521.94] on top of it and then of course you know

[519.719 - 525.4200000000001] these tools cite their sources so then

[521.94 - 526.98] if I have Google bard or another uh you

[525.42 - 528.42] know Bing or whatever that I'm

[526.98 - 529.9200000000001] interacting with and it's and I'm

[528.42 - 531.779] talking to it about news a social

[529.92 - 533.2199999999999] landscape whatever what are my friends

[531.779 - 534.66] up to

[533.22 - 537.0600000000001] um you know who should I what friends

[534.66 - 540.0] should I call today you know go read

[537.06 - 541.6199999999999] their Twitter feeds for me or whatever

[540.0 - 542.82] um you know it is possible that we're

[541.62 - 544.86] going to go that way there's no

[542.82 - 547.2600000000001] consensus which is really interesting to

[544.86 - 549.9590000000001] me is I thought it would be like really

[547.26 - 552.54] obvious like people are saying no AI is

[549.959 - 555.42] going to completely replace search or no

[552.54 - 557.6999999999999] search is obviously going to stay

[555.42 - 558.959] um if there's mix if the results are

[557.7 - 561.12] this mixed I think it's going to be both

[558.959 - 563.04] right this is a false dichotomy it's a

[561.12 - 564.6] false choice but I thought these results

[563.04 - 565.38] were very interesting so I wanted to

[564.6 - 569.22] share

[565.38 - 572.58] okay so let's do a breakdown uh a pros

[569.22 - 574.62] and cons view of Microsoft so

[572.58 - 576.839] Bing had a good showing

[574.62 - 578.88] um they had a good live demo uh it

[576.839 - 581.1] obviously works it is a little bit on

[578.88 - 582.48] the slow side which they addressed

[581.1 - 584.399] um or maybe it was some of the some of

[582.48 - 586.019] the interviews addressed

[584.399 - 587.279] um I watched an interview with Satya

[586.019 - 589.44] Nadella

[587.279 - 592.14] um and he's got a very clear-headed

[589.44 - 594.9590000000001] approach to wanting to take a larger

[592.14 - 597.18] market share of of search and I think

[594.959 - 600.8389999999999] that being with AI will do that

[597.18 - 603.18] especially since uh chat GPT and gpt3

[600.839 - 604.9200000000001] are going to be integrated across

[603.18 - 607.14] Microsoft's landscape they're already

[604.92 - 610.38] rolling out teams premium with chat GPT

[607.14 - 612.36] built in I have had the privilege of

[610.38 - 615.06] speaking with various teams and product

[612.36 - 617.279] owners throughout Microsoft

[615.06 - 619.8599999999999] um they the the entire organization at

[617.279 - 622.019] Microsoft is working on integrating uh

[619.86 - 625.019] GPT Technologies

[622.019 - 628.74] um and so we are going to see business

[625.019 - 631.86] software very quickly pivot to be truly

[628.74 - 634.86] like 21st century or AI based Microsoft

[631.86 - 638.16] has Windows which runs desktop PCS

[634.86 - 640.86] gaming and server infrastructure

[638.16 - 644.399] um so I can imagine that uh businesses

[640.86 - 647.6] are going to really benefit from AI

[644.399 - 651.66] integration above and beyond just Bing

[647.6 - 654.3000000000001] now another Pro in the in the uh column

[651.66 - 657.36] for Microsoft is they can afford to lose

[654.3 - 659.9399999999999] the search War Microsoft has so many

[657.36 - 662.339] other business segments they are like a

[659.94 - 665.0400000000001] uh they're like a a federation or A

[662.339 - 668.5790000000001] Confederacy of business units all of

[665.04 - 671.519] which provide value whereas Google is

[668.579 - 673.8599999999999] monolithic 70 I think it's 70 to 90

[671.519 - 676.5] percent of Google's revenue comes from

[673.86 - 679.2] search so and we'll get into that in

[676.5 - 681.899] just a minute now that being said the

[679.2 - 683.519] cons on Microsoft side is that it was a

[681.899 - 685.68] pretty anemic showing they had one

[683.519 - 687.42] basically one product

[685.68 - 689.579] um and it kind of felt like a

[687.42 - 692.279] half-hearted attempt it really reminds

[689.579 - 695.0999999999999] me of Zune where Microsoft has really

[692.279 - 698.7] really always struggled to break into

[695.1 - 700.26] the b2c market or the consumer Market uh

[698.7 - 704.76] think about their competition with apple

[700.26 - 707.76] apple has had a very coherent consumer

[704.76 - 710.88] ecosystem for a long time with iTunes

[707.76 - 713.04] iPhone ever you know I everything

[710.88 - 716.399] um Microsoft has really struggled with

[713.04 - 718.38] that the only exception being Xbox right

[716.399 - 721.32] with their gaming platform and and how

[718.38 - 723.779] Central Microsoft Windows has been to

[721.32 - 725.7] desktop gaming and then of course some

[723.779 - 727.98] console gaming of course the console

[725.7 - 729.6600000000001] Market is a little bit different uh

[727.98 - 732.9590000000001] because you've got you know PlayStation

[729.66 - 734.579] is still a major player uh and a handful

[732.959 - 735.899] of others

[734.579 - 738.18] um but you know you've also seen others

[735.899 - 740.339] go the way the dinosaurs Sega got out of

[738.18 - 743.9399999999999] the console they only produce games now

[740.339 - 745.62] so anyways uh I that's that's kind of

[743.94 - 747.899] that's kind of the high level overview

[745.62 - 750.839] pros and cons for Microsoft so now let's

[747.899 - 752.94] look at Google uh how the last couple

[750.839 - 755.6400000000001] days how does their showing Stack Up in

[752.94 - 758.519] terms of pros and cons the biggest Pro

[755.64 - 761.8199999999999] is they brought a huge portfolio of

[758.519 - 763.2] products uh to to share they they

[761.82 - 766.5] addressed arts and culture they

[763.2 - 769.32] addressed navigation maps translation uh

[766.5 - 770.82] entertainment they had so much to going

[769.32 - 773.22] for them

[770.82 - 775.32] um uh Google has mobile they have

[773.22 - 776.639] Android who has a Windows phone I don't

[775.32 - 777.839] think they even make Windows phones

[776.639 - 781.8] anymore

[777.839 - 784.98] um so Android is going to be a huge huge

[781.8 - 788.0999999999999] Boon for Google in deploying access to

[784.98 - 791.22] these whether it's Bard or any of these

[788.1 - 794.7] other things such as lens Maps

[791.22 - 796.8000000000001] we like you can get by without a laptop

[794.7 - 798.9590000000001] or desktop today you can get by with

[796.8 - 801.62] just a smartphone or a tablet

[798.959 - 805.38] um which means that Android uh is

[801.62 - 808.079] incredible for for Google Now Google

[805.38 - 810.66] also has Chrome the most used browser

[808.079 - 812.459] globally so regardless of whether or not

[810.66 - 814.1999999999999] you're using a Windows server or Windows

[812.459 - 816.7199999999999] desktop you're probably using Chrome

[814.2 - 818.519] that or Firefox right

[816.72 - 820.2] um oh I actually have some folks that

[818.519 - 822.6] I'm going to be talking to at Mozilla

[820.2 - 824.1] about trustworthy AI so keep uh keep

[822.6 - 826.019] your eyes peeled for that video coming

[824.1 - 829.26] up if they let me talk about it

[826.019 - 831.839] obviously I honor ndas there's plenty of

[829.26 - 833.22] stuff that I know that I am not sharing

[831.839 - 835.5] um because you know I like when people

[833.22 - 838.019] share stuff with me uh but anyways

[835.5 - 840.24] getting distracted point being is Google

[838.019 - 843.9590000000001] has Android and Chrome

[840.24 - 846.54] which uh that's a tough nut to crack and

[843.959 - 850.1389999999999] I don't think that being with AI alone

[846.54 - 852.8389999999999] is going to dislodge and and dislodge uh

[850.139 - 855.48] Chrome because Edge is like okay sure

[852.839 - 857.339] but what else right uh whether or not

[855.48 - 858.839] it's trusted you know Edge is now the

[857.339 - 860.7600000000001] fastest way to download Chrome and

[858.839 - 862.2] Firefox right or whatever else you want

[860.76 - 864.54] to use

[862.2 - 866.339] um so Google also has an established

[864.54 - 868.6999999999999] dominance in brand trust where it comes

[866.339 - 871.019] to search we just trust Google results

[868.7 - 873.36] and trust is one of those things that

[871.019 - 876.0] Google has managed to maintain when

[873.36 - 879.3000000000001] other Tech giants like meta AKA Facebook

[876.0 - 881.1] lost trust and is now imploding

[879.3 - 883.62] um ditto for Tesla

[881.1 - 885.66] uh so Google has managed to maintain

[883.62 - 887.699] trust to be fair Microsoft has

[885.66 - 889.38] maintained trust as well just not with

[887.699 - 892.139] some of their products namely Edge

[889.38 - 895.019] Cortana because they have a long history

[892.139 - 897.3] of failed products that they just didn't

[895.019 - 900.24] really seem to invest in

[897.3 - 902.04] um now uh this is both a pro and a con

[900.24 - 905.16] for Google is they cannot afford to lose

[902.04 - 907.139] this so it is a pro in the fact that

[905.16 - 909.8389999999999] they can't they can't afford to lose it

[907.139 - 912.24] so they're going to go all in right they

[909.839 - 914.519] Google will intrinsically put more

[912.24 - 916.32] energy and money into winning the search

[914.519 - 918.66] War than Microsoft will because

[916.32 - 920.519] Microsoft can afford to lose it so there

[918.66 - 922.8] may be they might you know have a foray

[920.519 - 925.079] just like how zun tried to compete with

[922.8 - 927.3] iPods and they're like okay well that

[925.079 - 928.8599999999999] didn't really work they Microsoft did

[927.3 - 930.8389999999999] the same thing with with Windows phone

[928.86 - 932.22] they wanted to compete with iPhone it

[930.839 - 935.1] didn't really work so they let it go

[932.22 - 938.1] right so the core business of Microsoft

[935.1 - 940.5600000000001] and Google is different but because of

[938.1 - 942.0600000000001] that Google really cannot afford to lose

[940.56 - 944.6389999999999] this this war

[942.06 - 947.9399999999999] now they also lost Tempo and initiative

[944.639 - 950.04] as I mentioned earlier Google created

[947.94 - 952.86] the technology that is driving this

[950.04 - 955.86] revolution they started this trend in

[952.86 - 958.32] 2016 which is what seven years ago right

[955.86 - 960.0] and this came back to bite them too so

[958.32 - 963.5400000000001] I'm one thing that I'm concerned about

[960.0 - 965.579] is uh and and uh people in the alignment

[963.54 - 966.899] spaces are talking about this now is

[965.579 - 969.42] that there's this there's this

[966.899 - 971.82] frigidness that's kind of settling on to

[969.42 - 974.3389999999999] open source which is the big players

[971.82 - 976.019] like Google deepmind Microsoft open AI

[974.339 - 978.12] they have published research and there's

[976.019 - 979.32] a lot of takers both in the corporate

[978.12 - 983.279] space but also in the International

[979.32 - 985.1990000000001] Space and so I'm wondering if this is

[983.279 - 987.779] going to cause a lot of the tech Giants

[985.199 - 990.3599999999999] to clam up and switch from open source

[987.779 - 992.279] to closed Source uh because something as

[990.36 - 994.8000000000001] innocuous as the Transformer Innovation

[992.279 - 997.019] and the uh and the the

[994.8 - 998.639] um and the lost signals all the

[997.019 - 1001.82] algorithmic improvements that allowed

[998.639 - 1004.339] for the current wave of AI what if

[1001.82 - 1007.279] Google hadn't if they what if Google had

[1004.339 - 1010.399] realized what they had seven years ago

[1007.279 - 1012.56] and kept it all closed Source like that

[1010.399 - 1014.779] would be bad for all of us but it would

[1012.56 - 1015.7399999999999] be really good for Google so that's one

[1014.779 - 1017.72] thing that I'm concerned about and

[1015.74 - 1020.0] that's why I posted that as a con not

[1017.72 - 1022.4590000000001] necessarily for Google but for all of us

[1020.0 - 1024.98] is the possibility that we're going to

[1022.459 - 1027.4389999999999] get this this really uh kind of hostile

[1024.98 - 1028.939] environment and we're gonna get rid of

[1027.439 - 1031.28] Open Source

[1028.939 - 1032.78] so here's my here's my personal

[1031.28 - 1035.66] conclusions

[1032.78 - 1040.16] Google is the hands down winner up front

[1035.66 - 1042.14] for now uh the in the long run the lines

[1040.16 - 1044.72] might break down over B to B which is

[1042.14 - 1047.1200000000001] business to business versus B to C or

[1044.72 - 1049.04] business to customer Microsoft their

[1047.12 - 1051.08] core business has always been B2B

[1049.04 - 1053.54] software business software Google

[1051.08 - 1055.34] they're better in the consumer space so

[1053.54 - 1056.799] they might ultimately just kind of stick

[1055.34 - 1059.84] with their Core Business

[1056.799 - 1062.66] another uh takeaway is Google must go

[1059.84 - 1064.1599999999999] all in on AI and that means pivoting

[1062.66 - 1067.3400000000001] their entire organization if they have

[1064.16 - 1069.919] to they just laid off 12 000 more people

[1067.34 - 1072.32] um so you know they're gonna pivot they

[1069.919 - 1075.5590000000002] have to if they want to survive they

[1072.32 - 1077.84] will need to go all in Google has a much

[1075.559 - 1080.12] broader range of offerings on B2B or

[1077.84 - 1082.1599999999999] sorry b2c with their Android and chrome

[1080.12 - 1085.4599999999998] platforms as one of the primary uh

[1082.16 - 1087.679] delivery mechanisms but Microsoft has a

[1085.46 - 1091.16] much more comprehensive B2B portfolio

[1087.679 - 1092.72] with Microsoft Office server Azure and

[1091.16 - 1093.98] everything else so again they're

[1092.72 - 1096.14] probably going to end up playing in

[1093.98 - 1097.7] their own sandboxes just as they have

[1096.14 - 1099.5590000000002] been

[1097.7 - 1103.22] um one thing that was missing from this

[1099.559 - 1105.44] was gaming and AI assistance uh like why

[1103.22 - 1106.46] didn't Microsoft say anything about Xbox

[1105.44 - 1109.5800000000002] like

[1106.46 - 1111.5] are they not gonna like create a you

[1109.58 - 1113.6] know realistic NPCs that you can have

[1111.5 - 1115.1] real conversations with that's what I

[1113.6 - 1117.5] think is really missing from this

[1115.1 - 1119.1789999999999] conversation so I promised earlier that

[1117.5 - 1121.419] we were going to touch on that so here's

[1119.179 - 1125.419] the last two slides of this presentation

[1121.419 - 1127.3400000000001] keep an eye on Nvidia Omniverse I don't

[1125.419 - 1129.3200000000002] know why Nvidia is not getting more

[1127.34 - 1131.72] attention if you go watch their

[1129.32 - 1133.78] omniverse videos for audio to face and

[1131.72 - 1137.1200000000001] their Ace their uh Avatar Cloud engine

[1133.78 - 1139.1] it is super impressive

[1137.12 - 1141.1399999999999] um you combine the conversational

[1139.1 - 1143.36] ability of chat GPT and large language

[1141.14 - 1145.5800000000002] models with this stuff you add a little

[1143.36 - 1149.059] bit more sophistication in you've got

[1145.58 - 1151.1] completely interactive uh avatars that

[1149.059 - 1153.1399999999999] can you know be whatever you need them

[1151.1 - 1156.02] to be whether it's gaming whether it's

[1153.14 - 1157.76] news whether it's teachers like oh man

[1156.02 - 1160.22] I've had some conversations with the

[1157.76 - 1162.74] folks over at Nvidia I am excited for

[1160.22 - 1165.2] them I don't think Nvidia yet realizes

[1162.74 - 1166.28] what they've got and so I want to wrap

[1165.2 - 1169.039] this up with something that's a little

[1166.28 - 1169.8799999999999] bit more abstract for the infrastructure

[1169.039 - 1173.36] people

[1169.88 - 1176.0] uh is uh nvidia's unified Computing

[1173.36 - 1178.34] framework that is a really boring Bland

[1176.0 - 1180.919] name but this is this is the

[1178.34 - 1182.84] underpinning technology that will allow

[1180.919 - 1186.0800000000002] for all of these other things to be

[1182.84 - 1188.24] delivered and matured and consumed and

[1186.08 - 1190.34] so I think that Nvidia might be that

[1188.24 - 1194.179] Underdog that people were talking about

[1190.34 - 1196.58] on on Twitter because all the Plug and

[1194.179 - 1198.919] Play stuff and I I definitely encourage

[1196.58 - 1200.96] you go look up Nvidia Ace and UCF watch

[1198.919 - 1203.24] the videos this stuff is really

[1200.96 - 1205.46] impressive this is going to allow

[1203.24 - 1209.1200000000001] anybody so you see the low code design

[1205.46 - 1211.4] tools sample applications all of it is

[1209.12 - 1214.3999999999999] they've got it nice and layered it's got

[1211.4 - 1217.4] a nice graphical user interface and it's

[1214.4 - 1219.98] also incredibly powerful this is coming

[1217.4 - 1222.3200000000002] it's coming fast and I think that Nvidia

[1219.98 - 1225.2] probably will be able to Corner this

[1222.32 - 1227.78] Market but the biggest thing is is I

[1225.2 - 1229.22] think that Nvidia sees themselves as the

[1227.78 - 1231.799] underdog they're very much acting like

[1229.22 - 1233.1200000000001] the underdog where they're like ah we're

[1231.799 - 1235.6399999999999] big but we're not going to compete with

[1233.12 - 1238.3999999999999] Google and Microsoft I think that Nvidia

[1235.64 - 1240.98] has the capacity to carve out a huge

[1238.4 - 1243.02] huge chunk of the market if they

[1240.98 - 1243.919] position themselves right and have the

[1243.02 - 1246.9189999999999] vision

[1243.919 - 1251.2] so thank you for watching we are in the

[1246.919 - 1251.2] hilarious timeline now take care
