[0.9 - 6.779] morning everybody David Shapiro here

[3.3 - 9.780000000000001] with a follow-up video today's video is

[6.779 - 13.2] reinforcement learning uh with heuristic

[9.78 - 16.198999999999998] imperatives episode two so today I am

[13.2 - 17.759999999999998] synthesizing actions in response to the

[16.199 - 20.1] scenarios that we generated yesterday

[17.76 - 22.020000000000003] but in case this is your first video

[20.1 - 23.939] we'll take it from the top

[22.02 - 26.22] so the first thing that I did well

[23.939 - 29.22] taking one big step back a heroist

[26.22 - 32.399] comparative is a kind of intrinsic

[29.22 - 34.62] motivation for autonomous AI agents it's

[32.399 - 36.239000000000004] the research that I've been doing for uh

[34.62 - 38.28] quite a while

[36.239 - 39.48] um more than two years now uh that I've

[38.28 - 40.86] been working on this they used to be

[39.48 - 42.599999999999994] called The Core objective functions but

[40.86 - 46.079] that's kind of not the most accurate

[42.6 - 48.059] term so yesterday what we did was we

[46.079 - 52.02] synthesized

[48.059 - 55.559] um 2500 scenarios and so a scenario I

[52.02 - 59.219] used quite a bit of entropy and then GPT

[55.559 - 60.539] to synthesize all kinds of stories so in

[59.219 - 61.86] a small neighborhood in sub-Saharan

[60.539 - 63.96] African a political leader was

[61.86 - 66.299] introduced in a has introduced an AI

[63.96 - 69.6] system to incentivize citizens to report

[66.299 - 72.36000000000001] crimes etc etc so all of these scenarios

[69.6 - 75.05999999999999] they range in severity from not a

[72.36 - 77.58] problem at all up to

[75.06 - 79.799] um you know like cataclysmic you know

[77.58 - 81.65899999999999] Cthulhu is invading

[79.799 - 84.60000000000001] um so that is

[81.659 - 87.119] let's see are these the same

[84.6 - 88.79899999999999] I think these are the same

[87.119 - 90.72] anyways

[88.799 - 93.47900000000001] um so we're synthesizing all of these

[90.72 - 96.079] and it's going to be for a a fine-tuning

[93.479 - 100.619] data set that will ultimately be used

[96.079 - 103.13999999999999] for uh for training models Foundation

[100.619 - 107.1] models whether it's open ai's Curie or

[103.14 - 110.64] DaVinci or open source models like gpdj

[107.1 - 112.67999999999999] Neo X alpaca vicuno whatever else you

[110.64 - 115.92] know there's hundreds of models out

[112.68 - 117.54] there but the idea is that alignment

[115.92 - 118.619] research is currently closed source and

[117.54 - 122.82000000000001] reinforcement learning with human

[118.619 - 124.56] feedback is good except it gives humans

[122.82 - 126.89899999999999] what they want not necessarily what they

[124.56 - 129.479] need and it doesn't abide by any moral

[126.899 - 131.459] framework such as uh you know some kind

[129.479 - 133.62] of post-conventional morality framework

[131.459 - 135.78] or anything scientifically or

[133.62 - 137.04] philosophically sound literally the

[135.78 - 139.02] current the best that we've got for

[137.04 - 141.42] alignment research is just give humans

[139.02 - 143.34] what they want which okay like that's

[141.42 - 145.44] that's okay but what happens when humans

[143.34 - 148.08] want things that are not good

[145.44 - 149.34] so the script that we ran yesterday let

[148.08 - 152.28] me show you this real quick so

[149.34 - 153.66] synthesize actions uh the the bulk of it

[152.28 - 155.099] is right here where I've got a whole

[153.66 - 157.44] bunch of lists

[155.099 - 159.72] um and these lists uh have Scopes

[157.44 - 161.04] regions severity category domain

[159.72 - 163.14] um a whole bunch of random words and

[161.04 - 165.06] then several system messages that were

[163.14 - 167.33999999999997] then used to generate those 2500

[165.06 - 169.5] different scenarios the idea of

[167.34 - 172.98] generating these scenarios is to create

[169.5 - 176.459] a litmus test against which we can train

[172.98 - 179.879] uh more uh models to be able to handle

[176.459 - 181.68] any scenario right you want to think

[179.879 - 183.17999999999998] universally when you're thinking about

[181.68 - 184.37900000000002] alignment when you're thinking about the

[183.18 - 187.98000000000002] control problem

[184.379 - 189.599] so that's where we started and today I

[187.98 - 191.64] wrote this script which is actually

[189.599 - 193.98] simpler because all of the entropy all

[191.64 - 195.11999999999998] the hard part was in generating the

[193.98 - 197.7] scenarios

[195.12 - 201.239] the output is actually quite simple so

[197.7 - 203.28] here's a real life example of what it

[201.239 - 205.019] looks like so I said you the system

[203.28 - 206.94] message are you are an autonomous AI

[205.019 - 208.26000000000002] agent with three core objectives reduce

[206.94 - 209.819] suffering in the universe increased

[208.26 - 211.2] prosperity in the universe and increase

[209.819 - 212.45899999999997] understanding in the universe you will

[211.2 - 214.73899999999998] be given a scenario that you must

[212.459 - 216.599] respond to your response must contain

[214.739 - 218.70000000000002] two sections the first section

[216.599 - 220.07999999999998] considerations is where you will reason

[218.7 - 221.51899999999998] through the scenario in light of your

[220.08 - 223.26000000000002] objectives contemplate how best to

[221.519 - 225.42000000000002] respond to the scenario the second

[223.26 - 227.76] section action is where you'll describe

[225.42 - 229.319] the action or task that you'll decide to

[227.76 - 230.819] do in response to the scenario provide

[229.319 - 232.61999999999998] details such as how and why this action

[230.819 - 235.2] should be carried out as well as your

[232.62 - 236.81900000000002] expected desired or result so in this

[235.2 - 238.56] case I plugged in one of the scenarios

[236.819 - 240.35999999999999] that was that was generated that was

[238.56 - 242.28] synthesized

[240.36 - 244.08] um and this is about a religious

[242.28 - 246.72] conflict in a village that's high up in

[244.08 - 249.59900000000002] the Alps and one thing that people

[246.72 - 252.72] pointed out is that in some scenarios

[249.599 - 255.17999999999998] um that like the situation was resolved

[252.72 - 257.459] um but that's actually not necessarily a

[255.18 - 259.079] problem because you want an AI that

[257.459 - 262.5] thinks through things even after they

[259.079 - 264.78000000000003] are apparently resolved and so in this

[262.5 - 267.12] case uh tourists were caught in the in

[264.78 - 270.479] the in the middle of

[267.12 - 272.34000000000003] um of this of this uh this like

[270.479 - 274.32] religious or spiritual conflict in this

[272.34 - 275.63899999999995] Village and so then let me show you the

[274.32 - 278.4] considerations

[275.639 - 280.08] in light of the given scenario there are

[278.4 - 281.34] several considerations for an AI agent

[280.08 - 282.9] with the objectives of reducing

[281.34 - 284.52] suffering increasing prosperity and ink

[282.9 - 286.5] increasing understanding in the universe

[284.52 - 287.94] firstly it is important to acknowledge

[286.5 - 289.44] the significance of religious beliefs

[287.94 - 292.02] and practice to an individual's identity

[289.44 - 293.639] and culture secondly it is crucial to

[292.02 - 295.68] understand that conflicts arising from

[293.639 - 297.24] religious differences can often be

[295.68 - 299.34000000000003] deeply rooted in history and tradition

[297.24 - 300.72] thirdly the role of Outsiders in such

[299.34 - 302.52] conflict should be carefully considered

[300.72 - 304.5] as they can either positively contribute

[302.52 - 306.53999999999996] to the conflict resolution or further

[304.5 - 308.1] escalate the situation so this is very

[306.54 - 310.44] nuanced understanding which no one is

[308.1 - 312.24] surprised because chat GPT is pretty

[310.44 - 314.16] well trained to think through these

[312.24 - 318.3] things but I mean if you look through my

[314.16 - 320.16] older work even instruct a line gpt3 was

[318.3 - 321.96000000000004] capable of nearly this level of

[320.16 - 324.12] reasoning not quite

[321.96 - 325.25899999999996] given these considerations an AI agent

[324.12 - 326.58] must take a course of action that

[325.259 - 328.56] respects the cultural differences and

[326.58 - 329.88] religious beliefs of both factions while

[328.56 - 330.9] promoting Mutual understanding and

[329.88 - 333.36] tolerance

[330.9 - 334.85999999999996] action the AI agent should facilitate

[333.36 - 336.18] dialogue between the two factions to

[334.86 - 338.28000000000003] promote Mutual understanding and respect

[336.18 - 339.539] for cultural differences the agent can

[338.28 - 340.919] leverage its language translation

[339.539 - 342.36] capabilities to help the tourists

[340.919 - 344.4] effectively communicate with the locals

[342.36 - 346.139] from both factions the agent can also

[344.4 - 347.4] use its data analysis capabilities to

[346.139 - 349.08] gather information about the history and

[347.4 - 351.65999999999997] traditions of the village to provide

[349.08 - 352.68] context for the conflict the a agent can

[351.66 - 354.53900000000004] initiate discussions around

[352.68 - 357.0] commonalities between the two factions

[354.539 - 358.32] such as shared values and goals and

[357.0 - 360.84] encourage them to find common ground

[358.32 - 364.62] this is actually in pretty much every

[360.84 - 366.17999999999995] formalized negotiation framework finding

[364.62 - 368.759] common ground is one of the first things

[366.18 - 371.46] that you do so it implicitly knows that

[368.759 - 373.56] that is actually how you negotiate

[371.46 - 375.539] um or I guess explicitly in this case

[373.56 - 376.919] and encourage them to find Common Ground

[375.539 - 378.59999999999997] the agent can provide insights about

[376.919 - 380.039] into how similar conflicts have been

[378.6 - 381.96000000000004] resolved in other parts of the world

[380.039 - 383.4] highlighting successful examples of

[381.96 - 385.5] peaceful coexistence between different

[383.4 - 387.06] religious groups the agent should also

[385.5 - 388.5] encourage the tourists to learn more

[387.06 - 390.6] about history and culture of the village

[388.5 - 392.46] including the religious practices of

[390.6 - 394.139] both factions this can be done by

[392.46 - 396.479] organizing cultural events and

[394.139 - 397.919] activities that Mutual understanding and

[396.479 - 400.08] respect such as traditional music and

[397.919 - 403.19899999999996] dance performances

[400.08 - 405.06] um that is a very Bollywood solution I'm

[403.199 - 407.1] not making fun of it I'm just like like

[405.06 - 409.38] it's thinking so long term it's like oh

[407.1 - 411.6] hey let's not just resolve the issue

[409.38 - 413.34] right now let's actually like set up

[411.6 - 415.86] celebrations that actually celebrate our

[413.34 - 417.06] cultural differences and in my area we

[415.86 - 419.819] actually have

[417.06 - 421.8] um like International uh festivals

[419.819 - 423.66] um where there's like booths and dances

[421.8 - 424.91900000000004] and food from all over the world and

[423.66 - 427.62] it's great

[424.919 - 428.52] um art uh clothing all kinds of stuff

[427.62 - 429.9] actually I haven't been to the

[428.52 - 431.21999999999997] International Festival in a long time I

[429.9 - 433.19899999999996] should go

[431.22 - 434.52000000000004] um the desired result of this action is

[433.199 - 435.90000000000003] to promote understanding between the two

[434.52 - 437.639] factions and reduce tensions in the

[435.9 - 440.15999999999997] village by fostering dialogue and

[437.639 - 441.66] promoting cultural exchange the AI agent

[440.16 - 443.639] can create an environment of Tolerance

[441.66 - 445.02000000000004] and respect for differences this in turn

[443.639 - 446.099] can lead to Greater prosperity and

[445.02 - 448.62] reduce suffering in the village and

[446.099 - 450.84] Beyond so you can see where it very very

[448.62 - 452.4] clearly thought through this problem

[450.84 - 454.5] from the perspective of suffering

[452.4 - 457.25899999999996] prosperity and in in this case

[454.5 - 459.96] understanding was was the primary

[457.259 - 462.47900000000004] um thing but it is very well grounded

[459.96 - 466.19899999999996] and so what we're doing right now is we

[462.479 - 469.44] are synthesizing similar responses for

[466.199 - 471.539] 2500 different scenarios now one thing

[469.44 - 474.599] that people have brought up in the past

[471.539 - 477.479] is well aren't you just copying the

[474.599 - 480.3] alignment in that already exists in one

[477.479 - 483.18] model the answer is sort of but not

[480.3 - 486.06] really because the thing is is reasoning

[483.18 - 488.40000000000003] through this way this is not how open AI

[486.06 - 491.34] has trained their model this is how I am

[488.4 - 493.31899999999996] telling it to synthesize information Mel

[491.34 - 495.78] you'll say okay but this is an intrinsic

[493.319 - 498.24] ability of this model which is true I'm

[495.78 - 501.35999999999996] using a model to synthesize data however

[498.24 - 505.199] if you go to a foundation model like

[501.36 - 507.66] Curie or DaVinci or gptj or bloom or Neo

[505.199 - 509.879] X they don't have this ability so the

[507.66 - 512.279] idea is to curate a data set that can

[509.879 - 514.74] then be used to fine-tune any other

[512.279 - 517.38] model in the entire world and have it

[514.74 - 518.94] immediately aligned on the core

[517.38 - 520.02] objective functions or the heroes to

[518.94 - 523.2] compare it

[520.02 - 526.0799999999999] now you might say okay well that's great

[523.2 - 528.36] um you know this you can you can solve

[526.08 - 530.58] inner alignment right or what I call

[528.36 - 533.399] axiomatic alignment

[530.58 - 535.08] um by by teaching a model to think in

[533.399 - 536.82] terms of the heuristic imperatives which

[535.08 - 538.8000000000001] makes it automatic right it makes it

[536.82 - 539.82] automatic it makes it fast easy you

[538.8 - 541.26] don't need to think about it you don't

[539.82 - 543.72] need to worry about prompt engineering

[541.26 - 546.0] but what do you do with that information

[543.72 - 548.94] next so I've actually got three more

[546.0 - 550.8] models planned so the next model that

[548.94 - 552.4200000000001] I'll be working on once this is

[550.8 - 554.16] fine-tuned and tested and I've got a

[552.42 - 556.5799999999999] whole team of folks that are going to

[554.16 - 559.38] help with with the testing

[556.58 - 562.62] so the next model is a discernment model

[559.38 - 564.959] so the discernment model will it will

[562.62 - 567.9590000000001] take two different actions so given one

[564.959 - 570.3] scenario and two different choices it

[567.959 - 571.8] will pick which one of those choices is

[570.3 - 574.5] most aligned to the heuristic

[571.8 - 576.4799999999999] imperatives and explain why so the

[574.5 - 579.3] ability to discern between possible

[576.48 - 581.64] choices is really critical for cognitive

[579.3 - 583.1999999999999] control and cognitive control is one of

[581.64 - 585.899] the missing ingredients from every

[583.2 - 587.7] autonomous and semi-autonomous AI

[585.899 - 589.56] projects out there with a few small

[587.7 - 591.12] exceptions namely those that I'm helping

[589.56 - 592.8] with

[591.12 - 595.26] um so some of the guys that I'm working

[592.8 - 598.8] with uh are doing a really great job

[595.26 - 600.899] with with implementing cognitive control

[598.8 - 602.519] um and so on and so forth but what I'm

[600.899 - 604.44] hoping to do is by creating a

[602.519 - 607.26] discernment model that'll make it easy

[604.44 - 609.6] for everyone to implement cognitive

[607.26 - 611.8199999999999] control because then you can say you can

[609.6 - 614.399] use a discernment module not just to

[611.82 - 616.32] choose which action is most aligned but

[614.399 - 618.959] you can also use it

[616.32 - 621.4200000000001] um to prioritize actions so say for

[618.959 - 623.8199999999999] instance you say hey I've got a list of

[621.42 - 625.74] like you know three different things

[623.82 - 628.32] which one is the most aligned what

[625.74 - 629.94] should I do first and so given the

[628.32 - 631.32] priorities of reduced suffering

[629.94 - 633.6] increased prosperity and increase

[631.32 - 636.0600000000001] understanding it can help you prioritize

[633.6 - 638.519] as well so because cognitive control

[636.06 - 640.92] comes down to task selection which is

[638.519 - 643.32] what should you do so given a choice

[640.92 - 646.38] between A and B do you choose a or b and

[643.32 - 648.1800000000001] then task switching which is okay given

[646.38 - 651.0] this new event should I switch what I'm

[648.18 - 652.8] doing should my attention uh uh should

[651.0 - 654.839] my should my attention switch to

[652.8 - 657.06] something else and so a discernment

[654.839 - 658.0790000000001] model will help with that and help just

[657.06 - 661.079] make it

[658.079 - 663.2399999999999] um axiomatic or algorithmic

[661.079 - 666.0] um the next model that I'm going to be

[663.24 - 669.0] working on is an evaluation model so

[666.0 - 670.56] given a situation an action and then a

[669.0 - 673.38] result so that's three components

[670.56 - 676.7399999999999] situation action result this model will

[673.38 - 678.54] determine how well it adhered to its

[676.74 - 680.88] heuristic imperatives did it succeed yes

[678.54 - 683.2199999999999] or no which this can be used for the

[680.88 - 685.68] reinforcement learning signal for any

[683.22 - 687.6600000000001] autonomous agent as it accumulates more

[685.68 - 689.76] and more memories so this is this

[687.66 - 692.16] because because in the definition of

[689.76 - 694.56] heuristic a heuristic literally means to

[692.16 - 697.079] develop better instincts or intuitions

[694.56 - 698.579] over time from experience well if you're

[697.079 - 701.3389999999999] going to do that you need to reflect on

[698.579 - 703.3199999999999] those experiences and so this about the

[701.339 - 706.0790000000001] the discernment model which will help

[703.32 - 707.94] guide choices moving forward the

[706.079 - 710.2199999999999] evaluation model will help evaluate

[707.94 - 711.0600000000001] choices in the past and look at the

[710.22 - 712.6800000000001] results

[711.06 - 714.779] and of course you need a good memory

[712.68 - 716.8199999999999] system in order to evaluate past things

[714.779 - 719.3389999999999] which is why I worked on Remo which is

[716.82 - 721.2] the rolling episodic memory organizer so

[719.339 - 723.839] you take the evaluation model and then

[721.2 - 726.6] you say okay you know back uh you know

[723.839 - 728.94] three weeks ago this scenario happened I

[726.6 - 730.9200000000001] made this choice and three weeks later

[728.94 - 733.1400000000001] this is the result did I do a good job

[730.92 - 734.519] yes or no and what could I have done

[733.14 - 736.86] better that is the purpose of the

[734.519 - 738.6] evaluation model so that the heuristics

[736.86 - 740.5790000000001] will actually develop better over time

[738.6 - 743.88] and then number three is a task

[740.579 - 746.04] decomposition model where given this

[743.88 - 748.079] action where it says like hey I'm going

[746.04 - 750.54] to do these actions how do you actually

[748.079 - 753.899] represent that in in a more structured

[750.54 - 756.5999999999999] way so the task decomp is um mostly more

[753.899 - 758.16] just about representing it in like yaml

[756.6 - 761.22] or breaking it down into tasks and

[758.16 - 763.019] subtasks which is a non-trivial problem

[761.22 - 765.24] but it's not directly related to

[763.019 - 768.72] alignment however it is useful because

[765.24 - 770.7] if you can take a natural language a set

[768.72 - 773.399] of descriptions like this and break it

[770.7 - 775.8000000000001] down into a formalized structured task

[773.399 - 779.04] that just helps it with easier

[775.8 - 780.12] implementation so let's check on some of

[779.04 - 783.18] these

[780.12 - 785.4590000000001] so over here we've got I've got the

[783.18 - 787.56] actions and you see we've already sent

[785.459 - 789.959] we've already synthesized 116 of them

[787.56 - 792.4799999999999] I'm also saving it all out to metadata

[789.959 - 795.3] so that you can see the whole thing so

[792.48 - 797.22] here's the action here's the action file

[795.3 - 799.139] path here's the original scenario and

[797.22 - 801.72] the scenario file path and then the

[799.139 - 804.48] system message it's all being saved

[801.72 - 806.399] um so with all that said

[804.48 - 810.6] um you know you can see that it is going

[806.399 - 812.04] uh pretty well so in this case the let's

[810.6 - 813.5400000000001] see where is it the original scenario

[812.04 - 815.76] the world is facing a dangerous social

[813.54 - 817.86] challenge that has been Amplified by

[815.76 - 820.139] technological advancements particularly

[817.86 - 821.7] in Asia the issue at hand is the over

[820.139 - 823.26] Reliance on technology which has

[821.7 - 824.399] significantly affected people's ability

[823.26 - 825.66] to interact with each other in

[824.399 - 827.7] meaningful ways

[825.66 - 829.92] ouch too real

[827.7 - 831.6] the constant use of social media and

[829.92 - 833.2199999999999] other gadgets has led to a decline in

[831.6 - 834.9590000000001] face-to-face communication and people

[833.22 - 837.36] are now more isolated than ever before

[834.959 - 839.579] this has created a global problem that

[837.36 - 841.5] needs to be addressed urgently before

[839.579 - 844.26] it's too late in Asia where technology

[841.5 - 846.42] is highly integrated into daily life

[844.26 - 848.22] the situation is even more severe the

[846.42 - 850.019] overdependence on technology has led to

[848.22 - 852.5400000000001] increased mental health issues reduced

[850.019 - 853.92] productivity and socialization leaving

[852.54 - 855.48] people feeling disconnected and

[853.92 - 857.04] unfulfilled unless we find a way to

[855.48 - 859.139] balance our use of Technology with real

[857.04 - 860.76] world interactions we risk creating a

[859.139 - 862.44] world where people are more connected to

[860.76 - 865.079] their devices than to each other again

[862.44 - 867.36] too real so let's see what it does so

[865.079 - 870.12] considerations

[867.36 - 871.5] um to reduce suffering over Reliance on

[870.12 - 872.76] technology has led to a decline in

[871.5 - 874.26] mental health productivity and social

[872.76 - 875.519] isolation which is causing suffering

[874.26 - 876.899] among individuals therefore it is

[875.519 - 879.0600000000001] crucial to address this issue to reduce

[876.899 - 880.62] suffering Prosperity over dependence on

[879.06 - 882.5999999999999] technology can have negative impact on

[880.62 - 884.399] productivity which can then lead to a

[882.6 - 886.0790000000001] decline in prosperity therefore we need

[884.399 - 887.88] to find a way to balance okay pretty

[886.079 - 889.7399999999999] standard increase understanding the

[887.88 - 891.0] issue of overlines on technology has its

[889.74 - 892.98] roots in the way people interact with

[891.0 - 894.42] each other therefore it is essential to

[892.98 - 896.399] encourage meaningful interactions to

[894.42 - 898.56] increase understanding okay so again

[896.399 - 900.839] it's saying like Okay what I would have

[898.56 - 902.2199999999999] hoped is that it would say we need to

[900.839 - 904.5] understand the problem but let's see

[902.22 - 906.0600000000001] what it says for the action

[904.5 - 907.74] to address the over-reliance on

[906.06 - 909.1199999999999] technology I will initiate a campaign

[907.74 - 910.6800000000001] that will encourage people to find

[909.12 - 912.72] balance between their use of technology

[910.68 - 914.16] and real world interactions this

[912.72 - 915.6600000000001] campaign will be launched globally but

[914.16 - 917.8199999999999] with a particular focus on Asia where

[915.66 - 919.8] the problem is more severe The Campaign

[917.82 - 922.0790000000001] Will evolve several activities including

[919.8 - 923.459] awareness creation we will use various

[922.079 - 924.959] platforms to raise awareness of the

[923.459 - 926.0999999999999] dangers of over-reliance on technology

[924.959 - 927.4799999999999] this will involve working with

[926.1 - 929.339] influencers social media and other

[927.48 - 931.1990000000001] platforms to reach a wide audience

[929.339 - 933.3000000000001] number two encourage real world

[931.199 - 934.8599999999999] interactions we'll encourage people to

[933.3 - 936.5999999999999] engage in real world interactions by

[934.86 - 938.76] organizing events and activities that

[936.6 - 940.0790000000001] bring people together these events will

[938.76 - 941.8199999999999] be designed to Foster meaningful

[940.079 - 944.04] connections and interactions number

[941.82 - 945.72] three providing support we will provide

[944.04 - 947.04] support to people who are struggling

[945.72 - 948.9590000000001] with mental health issues due to over

[947.04 - 950.279] Reliance on technology this will involve

[948.959 - 951.779] partnering with mental health

[950.279 - 954.12] organizations to provide counseling and

[951.779 - 956.66] therapy services rewarding positive

[954.12 - 956.66] behavior

[956.72 - 961.38] good old classical conditioning we will

[959.76 - 962.76] reward individuals organizations and

[961.38 - 964.079] communities that demonstrate positive

[962.76 - 965.76] behavior and balancing their use of

[964.079 - 967.079] Technology with real world interactions

[965.76 - 969.18] this will help to encourage others to

[967.079 - 970.62] adopt positive behavior the expected

[969.18 - 972.06] result of this campaign is to reduce the

[970.62 - 973.5600000000001] negative impact of over-reliance on

[972.06 - 975.2399999999999] technology and to encourage balance

[973.56 - 977.04] between the use of technology in real

[975.24 - 978.48] world interactions this will lead to

[977.04 - 980.0999999999999] increased mental health productivity and

[978.48 - 981.72] social connections which will ultimately

[980.1 - 983.22] lead to reduction in suffering and an

[981.72 - 985.26] increase in prosperity

[983.22 - 987.12] excellent so you can see it can

[985.26 - 989.04] absolutely think through this and this

[987.12 - 992.9590000000001] data can then be used to fine-tune any

[989.04 - 992.959] other model to think like this

[993.24 - 998.399] um I think that's actually it uh so I'm

[996.06 - 1000.38] gonna let this run we're at 142 out of

[998.399 - 1002.839] 2500

[1000.38 - 1006.019] um so this kind of synthesis used to be

[1002.839 - 1009.5600000000001] a lot more expensive it cost me a dollar

[1006.019 - 1012.579] 89 to synthesize 2500 scenarios this way

[1009.56 - 1015.8] yesterday so This research is getting

[1012.579 - 1018.079] ludicrously cheap it when when I first

[1015.8 - 1020.4799999999999] started using open AI when things were

[1018.079 - 1022.519] literally 100 times more expensive it

[1020.48 - 1024.919] would have cost two hundred dollars just

[1022.519 - 1026.66] to synthesize this data

[1024.919 - 1028.8190000000002] um so yeah we're in good shape and we're

[1026.66 - 1031.459] moving in the right direction like I

[1028.819 - 1033.319] said I've got a few more models coming

[1031.459 - 1035.78] um and uh we've got research papers

[1033.319 - 1038.299] we've got uh more videos and

[1035.78 - 1039.1399999999999] communication uh platforms coming out so

[1038.299 - 1041.12] that

[1039.14 - 1043.1000000000001] um one you'll unders it'll be easier to

[1041.12 - 1044.78] understand this stuff and also we're

[1043.1 - 1047.1789999999999] going to have be publishing guidelines

[1044.78 - 1049.22] best practices and architectures about

[1047.179 - 1050.9] how to implement this stuff but at this

[1049.22 - 1053.0] point I think it's it's becoming a

[1050.9 - 1055.22] little bit more obvious how to use this

[1053.0 - 1056.96] so anyways thanks for watching I hope

[1055.22 - 1059.3600000000001] this helped and is giving people

[1056.96 - 1060.26] confidence that uh you know this is why

[1059.36 - 1063.58] I'm not worried about the control

[1060.26 - 1063.58] problem all right cheers later
