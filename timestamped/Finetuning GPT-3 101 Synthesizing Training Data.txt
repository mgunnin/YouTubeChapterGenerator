[1.52 - 5.839] hey everybody david shapiro here for

[3.36 - 9.679] another tutorial video today we are

[5.839 - 10.96] going to go over um fine tuning 101 data

[9.679 - 11.84] prep

[10.96 - 13.360000000000001] so

[11.84 - 15.28] uh if you've watched my other videos you

[13.36 - 17.52] know that i'm a big fan of synthetic

[15.28 - 19.68] data sets especially because one it's

[17.52 - 21.84] fast two it's relatively cheap and three

[19.68 - 24.56] you get exactly what you want

[21.84 - 26.96] so what i want to do is show you an

[24.56 - 28.64] example of how to get synthetic data now

[26.96 - 30.880000000000003] one thing to keep in mind with fine

[28.64 - 33.36] tuning is that you're not actually

[30.88 - 35.44] training the model to do anything new

[33.36 - 37.92] gpt3 is already trained on many hundreds

[35.44 - 39.44] of gigabytes worth of data everything

[37.92 - 41.04] that you ask it to do it already knows

[39.44 - 43.92] how to do so the purpose of fine tuning

[41.04 - 45.519999999999996] is to narrow down to say do this one

[43.92 - 47.760000000000005] thing every time

[45.52 - 49.84] now because fine tuning is about

[47.76 - 50.96] removing possibilities

[49.84 - 53.68000000000001] you want to make sure that your fine

[50.96 - 55.44] tuning data has a broad variety so that

[53.68 - 56.32] it has seen

[55.44 - 58.399] many

[56.32 - 60.16] examples um

[58.399 - 62.32] and we'll get into advanced fine tuning

[60.16 - 64.64] techniques later um i'll probably do a

[62.32 - 65.43900000000001] video going over my question generating

[64.64 - 66.4] um

[65.439 - 68.63999999999999] bot

[66.4 - 70.64] because the more variety you show for

[68.64 - 72.799] the input and the more

[70.64 - 74.56] and the more examples you give in terms

[72.799 - 76.56] of that breadth of variety and like

[74.56 - 78.56] different formats the better it will

[76.56 - 80.08] perform now when you're doing synthetic

[78.56 - 82.4] data in the way that i'm about to show

[80.08 - 84.24] you it's a very consistent format

[82.4 - 85.60000000000001] but anyways so

[84.24 - 87.92] i wanted to start with something very

[85.6 - 90.64] simple which was just imagine a complete

[87.92 - 93.36] and detailed plot synopsis for a

[90.64 - 95.92] blank you know genre set in a location

[93.36 - 98.4] during a time and then the story should

[95.92 - 99.92] be uh you know add a couple modifiers

[98.4 - 101.2] write out the entire plot premise in

[99.92 - 104.159] great detail

[101.2 - 106.64] um now unfortunately uh the instruct

[104.159 - 109.92] series models are not the best

[106.64 - 111.759] at going in at long form writing

[109.92 - 114.24000000000001] but you see this one's okay it's doing

[111.759 - 115.84] all right um

[114.24 - 117.83999999999999] so

[115.84 - 119.43900000000001] it does a pretty good job it's almost

[117.84 - 122.399] like a movie poster it's not actually

[119.439 - 124.55999999999999] like writing out the story um

[122.399 - 126.799] but this is good enough for now um with

[124.56 - 128.319] a little bit more prompt engineering um

[126.799 - 130.72] here actually let's try it let's instead

[128.319 - 132.319] of premise let's say outline and see if

[130.72 - 134.64] that modifies it

[132.319 - 134.64] um

[139.599 - 143.2] yeah that looks like it's a little bit

[140.879 - 145.51999999999998] more detailed um but it's still not

[143.2 - 147.67999999999998] actually writing the whole story um

[145.52 - 150.0] because part of the problem is that gpt3

[147.68 - 151.92000000000002] was not trained on actual like plot

[150.0 - 153.92] outlines and actually if you watch my

[151.92 - 156.07999999999998] other videos um

[153.92 - 158.16] getting getting gpt3 to actually write

[156.08 - 159.84] fiction is really difficult so i'll

[158.16 - 162.0] modify the prompt to say instead of

[159.84 - 164.239] premise i'll say plot outline

[162.0 - 164.239] um

[164.64 - 168.16] and we'll just change this here as well

[166.64 - 171.76] so we're going to say write plot

[168.16 - 173.04] outlines okay so we've got this this is

[171.76 - 174.56] the prompt that i'm going to use and i'm

[173.04 - 177.12] going to auto populate it with different

[174.56 - 179.36] things so this is a really quick way to

[177.12 - 182.08] get a broader variety of data is where

[179.36 - 183.76000000000002] you ask it to do kind of the same prompt

[182.08 - 186.31900000000002] but you give it a bunch of different

[183.76 - 189.12] modifiers um so effectively what i'm

[186.319 - 190.879] going to do is give it you know 200

[189.12 - 193.12] different prompts and i'm going to

[190.879 - 196.0] record that output and then use that for

[193.12 - 198.72] fine tuning data

[196.0 - 202.48] and so the scripts that i've got

[198.72 - 204.4] oops uh is here here i did something

[202.48 - 205.44] wrong

[204.4 - 207.04] okay

[205.44 - 209.04] the script that i've got is synthesize

[207.04 - 211.599] plots um so what i've got is i've got a

[209.04 - 214.239] list of genres a list of modifiers a

[211.599 - 215.51899999999998] list of places and a list of periods so

[214.239 - 216.56] you get all this you can get a lot of

[215.519 - 218.0] variety you can get a lot of

[216.56 - 219.36] combinations

[218.0 - 220.72] the first time i ran it i had

[219.36 - 222.239] uncommented all these and it was like

[220.72 - 223.28] going to generate 2 000 different

[222.239 - 224.56] samples

[223.28 - 226.72] i'm not going to spend that much on a

[224.56 - 229.04] tutorial video so i cut it down to four

[226.72 - 232.239] by four by four by four so four to the

[229.04 - 234.159] fourth power is 256. so i've got four

[232.239 - 236.48000000000002] examples of each

[234.159 - 238.48] of each thing and then you might also

[236.48 - 241.599] notice that i've got the

[238.48 - 243.84] up here the uuid so uuid let me just

[241.599 - 244.79899999999998] show you what it looks like

[243.84 - 246.64000000000001] oops

[244.799 - 248.31900000000002] synthesize

[246.64 - 250.79899999999998] slots there we go

[248.319 - 253.04] okay so this is this is showing you the

[250.799 - 255.84] the prompts that it's going to run so it

[253.04 - 257.84] starts with a uuid up at the top a uu id

[255.84 - 259.759] is just a random string of hexadecimal

[257.84 - 261.84] characters

[259.759 - 263.6] but one thing that i found is that this

[261.84 - 265.11999999999995] does a really good job

[263.6 - 267.04] of

[265.12 - 269.199] of causing gpt3 to have a little bit

[267.04 - 271.68] more internal entropy by starting it

[269.199 - 272.88] with a uuid it's like okay i'm reading

[271.68 - 275.199] this i don't i don't know how to make

[272.88 - 276.8] sense of it so it's trying to create an

[275.199 - 280.0] internal state that doesn't make any

[276.8 - 281.36] sense so you you you prime it to be a

[280.0 - 282.56] little bit more different a little bit

[281.36 - 284.08000000000004] more random

[282.56 - 285.68] this is especially good if you need to

[284.08 - 288.08] run the same prompt over and over and

[285.68 - 289.68] over again so you do this in combination

[288.08 - 291.28] with a high temperature and you'll get a

[289.68 - 292.32] lot more variety

[291.28 - 294.479] but anyways you can see where it's

[292.32 - 295.919] populated out imagine a complete and

[294.479 - 297.52] detailed plot outline for a science

[295.919 - 300.15999999999997] fiction film set in india during the

[297.52 - 302.639] 1990s the story should be supernatural

[300.16 - 304.24] and otherworldly write out the entire

[302.639 - 305.84000000000003] plot

[304.24 - 308.32] write out the entire plot outline in

[305.84 - 310.96] great detail

[308.32 - 312.8] and then you see the number here 256. so

[310.96 - 315.039] if you go back here you say i just did a

[312.8 - 316.72] quick count to keep track of how many it

[315.039 - 318.15999999999997] generated just to show you that's what

[316.72 - 320.08000000000004] it's doing so we can comment this out

[318.16 - 323.28000000000003] since we don't need this

[320.08 - 325.35999999999996] um and then what we'll do is i have some

[323.28 - 328.08] some canned functions that i use so

[325.36 - 330.56] here's the uh here's the gpt3 completion

[328.08 - 333.28] um use text davinci o2 temperature one

[330.56 - 335.199] top p of one token's a thousand it's not

[333.28 - 336.15999999999997] generating anywhere near that much

[335.199 - 338.08] um

[336.16 - 341.28000000000003] and then we'll save we'll save all this

[338.08 - 343.19899999999996] out to gpt3 logs but then what are we

[341.28 - 344.88] going to do with the actual prompt and

[343.199 - 347.12] completion right because for fine tuning

[344.88 - 349.039] you need a prompt and a completion and

[347.12 - 351.44] we're not going to just record these

[349.039 - 353.44] prompts what would be the point of that

[351.44 - 356.0] we're not actually adding anything so

[353.44 - 358.16] what we got to do is we're going to then

[356.0 - 359.12] format a prompt to look a little bit

[358.16 - 360.639] different

[359.12 - 365.6] so we'll say

[360.639 - 367.759] completion equals gpt3 completion

[365.6 - 369.28000000000003] and then we'll beat in my prompt but

[367.759 - 371.84000000000003] i've got all i've got the genre the

[369.28 - 375.919] modifier the place and the period so

[371.84 - 380.08] what i want to do is i'll save the um

[375.919 - 381.68] the out the um the out prompt as

[380.08 - 383.44] it'll be a text

[381.68 - 385.52] that uh basically what i'll do is i'll

[383.44 - 387.52] just say um

[385.52 - 389.28] uh let's see

[387.52 - 392.4] genre equals

[389.28 - 394.15999999999997] that and then newline and then i'll say

[392.4 - 395.35999999999996] location

[394.16 - 397.12] is

[395.36 - 398.08000000000004] dollar s and so this dollar s i'll show

[397.12 - 399.759] you what i'm going to do with this in

[398.08 - 402.479] just a second

[399.759 - 404.24] genre location

[402.479 - 406.15999999999997] period

[404.24 - 409.479] and then

[406.16 - 409.47900000000004] and then modifier

[410.08 - 412.639] and so then we'll do that and then we'll

[411.759 - 415.199] do

[412.639 - 417.12] newline new line

[415.199 - 419.44] and then we'll do

[417.12 - 421.599] lot outline and then we'll add a little

[419.44 - 423.759] space and so basically what this will

[421.599 - 426.4] look like let me show you what the what

[423.759 - 430.40000000000003] the actual final prompt will look like

[426.4 - 432.08] um so instead of this it will have

[430.4 - 434.08] location

[432.08 - 435.52] period

[434.08 - 437.599] modifier

[435.52 - 440.79999999999995] and then double new line

[437.599 - 441.759] um plot outline and so it'll be like you

[440.8 - 445.599] know

[441.759 - 447.039] sci-fi or i guess i had it out as um

[445.599 - 451.039] science fiction

[447.039 - 453.039] location will be india period will be um

[451.039 - 455.44] the renaissance

[453.039 - 457.68] um and then the modifier will be like

[455.44 - 458.639] cerebral and what did i say like spooky

[457.68 - 460.479] or whatever

[458.639 - 462.84000000000003] um

[460.479 - 467.28] uh cerebral and suspenseful

[462.84 - 468.71999999999997] okay okay so given just these little bit

[467.28 - 470.96] of information

[468.72 - 472.72] um

[470.96 - 475.84] like if i just if i just put this into

[472.72 - 477.28000000000003] gpt3 right now it's it'll probably work

[475.84 - 478.63899999999995] a little bit oh i've misspelled

[477.28 - 480.96] suspenseful

[478.639 - 482.319] where did did i misspell that here i was

[480.96 - 483.35999999999996] just here

[482.319 - 486.0] okay

[483.36 - 490.0] i don't think i misspelled it up here

[486.0 - 491.759] um suspenseful yeah correct okay

[490.0 - 494.16] um

[491.759 - 497.68] it'll probably figure out what i want to

[494.16 - 499.44] do okay yeah so because it's fine-tuned

[497.68 - 501.84000000000003] um it can figure it out

[499.44 - 505.52] um it's not the best

[501.84 - 507.52] uh it certainly is just a plot premise

[505.52 - 511.68] it's not as complete

[507.52 - 514.0799999999999] as what was generated before

[511.68 - 515.36] but also this is with text davinci o2

[514.08 - 517.44] which is

[515.36 - 519.2] already fine-tuned to follow

[517.44 - 521.2] instructions

[519.2 - 522.5600000000001] uh another thing that you can do is once

[521.2 - 523.839] you generate data and we'll get into

[522.56 - 524.7199999999999] this let me do a quick time check

[523.839 - 526.1600000000001] actually

[524.72 - 528.64] um okay eight minutes we've got just a

[526.16 - 530.3199999999999] few minutes left um you can also go in

[528.64 - 534.16] and augment stuff so one thing that i

[530.32 - 536.6400000000001] like to do is um go to the edit model

[534.16 - 538.56] which is free right now at least it was

[536.64 - 540.3199999999999] and you can say like make this more

[538.56 - 541.1999999999999] detailed so

[540.32 - 543.279] let's

[541.2 - 545.44] um

[543.279 - 547.36] whoops that's not what i meant to do

[545.44 - 549.9200000000001] ah darn it got rid of what i

[547.36 - 551.2] what i wrote okay anyways point being

[549.92 - 553.5999999999999] i'll show you i'll show you the edit

[551.2 - 556.0] endpoint and this will be in an advanced

[553.6 - 558.64] uh tutorial as well anyways let's go

[556.0 - 560.72] back to our work

[558.64 - 563.1999999999999] um okay so we've got the completion so

[560.72 - 566.399] this is going to be the actual

[563.2 - 568.0] plot synopsis and then the out prompt is

[566.399 - 570.56] this and i showed you what this is going

[568.0 - 572.399] to look like here oh yeah here

[570.56 - 576.5999999999999] let me just go ahead and show you so

[572.399 - 576.6] we'll give it we'll get a plot outline

[577.68 - 582.959] an alternate history in india

[579.92 - 582.959] oh now this is fun

[585.36 - 589.76] um so apparently india invents ai during

[588.16 - 591.4399999999999] the renaissance that's kind of cool

[589.76 - 593.8389999999999] actually all right

[591.44 - 595.839] so here's here's a here's a

[593.839 - 597.839] food for thought later on you can use

[595.839 - 600.6400000000001] the edit endpoint

[597.839 - 600.6400000000001] and so we'll say

[601.12 - 603.519] let's see

[603.839 - 609.44] expand this plot outline to include more

[608.16 - 614.48] detail

[609.44 - 614.48] um make it a complete story

[615.519 - 618.48] and we'll turn the temperature all the

[616.8 - 620.079] way up because higher temperature

[618.48 - 621.6800000000001] generally leads to more creativity it

[620.079 - 624.16] can also lead to some random stuff that

[621.68 - 626.3199999999999] you don't want but anyways so another

[624.16 - 628.16] thing that you can do in in preparing

[626.32 - 629.7600000000001] your data is you can use the edit

[628.16 - 632.16] endpoint to

[629.76 - 634.64] further augment the data so by baking in

[632.16 - 636.48] multiple steps you can then have a data

[634.64 - 639.36] set that is trained to do

[636.48 - 642.72] more stuff oh here we go

[639.36 - 644.8000000000001] so this is a much longer

[642.72 - 646.5600000000001] plot synopsis so this is perfect i'm not

[644.8 - 648.079] going to do this this time but just i

[646.56 - 650.2399999999999] wanted to show you that this is a thing

[648.079 - 652.959] you can do you can use the edit endpoint

[650.24 - 654.16] to further augment your training data so

[652.959 - 656.4799999999999] this is great

[654.16 - 656.48] um

[656.56 - 662.88] let's see delighted in the

[658.839 - 662.8800000000001] stories acetics

[663.36 - 667.6800000000001] transmutation

[665.279 - 670.16] i think it actually did like an entirely

[667.68 - 672.4799999999999] different story okay

[670.16 - 672.48] um

[672.64 - 676.3199999999999] i don't know that it actually uh yeah

[675.36 - 677.2] okay

[676.32 - 678.6400000000001] the

[677.2 - 680.0] like i said if you have the really high

[678.64 - 682.3199999999999] temperature you can get stuff that you

[680.0 - 684.32] really don't do not expect um all right

[682.32 - 687.7600000000001] moving on we'll come back to uh

[684.32 - 690.24] augmenting techniques in a later video

[687.76 - 692.3199999999999] okay so here we are this is what we want

[690.24 - 694.0] the the prompt to look like so this is

[692.32 - 696.1600000000001] what we're going to record

[694.0 - 697.36] and then the output will just be the

[696.16 - 700.48] completion

[697.36 - 702.48] um and so then what we do is we'll do

[700.48 - 704.0790000000001] save file

[702.48 - 708.0790000000001] and actually let's do a file name real

[704.079 - 709.519] quick file name equals time

[708.079 - 711.68] plus

[709.519 - 716.32] dot text

[711.68 - 717.5999999999999] actually no file name will be

[716.32 - 719.44] will be

[717.6 - 722.72] uh let's see

[719.44 - 725.2790000000001] i need to remove the ands from it

[722.72 - 727.2] so we'll do

[725.279 - 729.519] what's the shortest one so we'll do

[727.2 - 734.0] place

[729.519 - 737.44] um place period genre okay yeah

[734.0 - 739.279] place plus period plus

[737.44 - 741.2] genre plus

[739.279 - 742.959] modifier

[741.2 - 744.48] um and then

[742.959 - 745.5189999999999] we will because each one of these is

[744.48 - 746.9590000000001] going to be unique it's only going to

[745.519 - 749.6] touch it once

[746.959 - 751.68] so then we'll do replace

[749.6 - 754.9590000000001] space with nothing

[751.68 - 756.6389999999999] and then we'll also do replace

[754.959 - 759.92] the and sign because i don't think i

[756.639 - 761.44] don't think it'll save that as a file

[759.92 - 763.1999999999999] and then we'll add

[761.44 - 765.2] dot text

[763.2 - 768.5600000000001] and then we'll do save file

[765.2 - 770.0790000000001] so the content of the file will be um

[768.56 - 773.1199999999999] wait make sure i

[770.079 - 776.0] file path is first okay so f uh so we're

[773.12 - 777.2] going to save the prompt out to

[776.0 - 781.279] prompt

[777.2 - 784.399] and then we'll do uh percent file name

[781.279 - 786.639] and then we'll do out prompt

[784.399 - 788.399] and then we'll do save file so basically

[786.639 - 790.5600000000001] what i'm doing is i'm saving the prompt

[788.399 - 792.639] and completion with the same file name

[790.56 - 794.959] but to different folders so then we'll

[792.639 - 796.32] do completions

[794.959 - 797.8389999999999] dollar s

[796.32 - 801.36] or a percent s

[797.839 - 803.6800000000001] percent file name and then completion

[801.36 - 804.48] um and there you have it that should be

[803.68 - 807.04] it

[804.48 - 809.12] um so what i like to do is for a quick

[807.04 - 810.399] debug because you obviously before you

[809.12 - 812.9590000000001] spend a lot of tokens you want to make

[810.399 - 816.32] sure it works right um so i i print out

[812.959 - 818.56] the prompt here but then let's also

[816.32 - 821.519] um just so we can watch while it's going

[818.56 - 824.4799999999999] here we'll do we'll just copy this

[821.519 - 824.48] so we'll do print

[824.56 - 828.959] out prompt and then print

[827.36 - 830.399] completion

[828.959 - 832.0] because why not you know if you're bored

[830.399 - 833.36] and you're watching your data run why

[832.0 - 835.36] not just do it

[833.36 - 838.88] okay so let's do

[835.36 - 838.88] cls to clear the screen

[839.199 - 842.88] um oops

[840.959 - 845.5999999999999] you have to wrap the text

[842.88 - 847.4399999999999] in actual quotations

[845.6 - 849.839] okay

[847.44 - 851.44] so we'll let it generate one and then

[849.839 - 853.7600000000001] we'll see what happens so this is a

[851.44 - 856.399] romance and comedy set in france during

[853.76 - 858.24] the renaissance this should be fun

[856.399 - 860.639] oh i forgot to do a thing

[858.24 - 862.0790000000001] um yeah i bet i bet this i bet it didn't

[860.639 - 864.0] look right so this is why you check your

[862.079 - 865.3599999999999] work so during the renaissance in france

[864.0 - 866.8] two lovers pierre and maria must

[865.36 - 869.279] overcome tremendous obstacles to be

[866.8 - 871.68] together their families rival noble our

[869.279 - 873.6] rival noble houses oh this is fun

[871.68 - 876.4799999999999] um war is brewing this sounds like war

[873.6 - 878.5600000000001] on the fondane um

[876.48 - 880.48] undaunted pier and murray made in secret

[878.56 - 882.7199999999999] planning to elope betrayed by one of

[880.48 - 884.9590000000001] murray's maidservants oh this is fun

[882.72 - 886.88] jealous older brother henry

[884.959 - 889.04] in a fierce battle they are mortally

[886.88 - 890.16] wounded and marie's art dies in murray's

[889.04 - 892.399] arms

[890.16 - 893.6] and he tells her to flee marie lu

[892.399 - 895.839] refuses

[893.6 - 898.5600000000001] so yeah this is this is romance and

[895.839 - 899.7600000000001] comedy um i don't really see much comedy

[898.56 - 901.3599999999999] in here

[899.76 - 902.959] as the lover's souls depart this world

[901.36 - 904.9590000000001] they vow to find each other again in the

[902.959 - 907.92] next life so it looks like the the

[904.959 - 909.5999999999999] modifier is kind of hijacking it

[907.92 - 911.68] i don't really see how you could make

[909.6 - 913.6] the i mean it's certainly romance but

[911.68 - 915.68] it's not a comedy

[913.6 - 917.279] so sometimes these things are

[915.68 - 918.8] conflicting but let's check the output

[917.279 - 920.16] data to make sure that it did what i

[918.8 - 922.56] expected

[920.16 - 924.8] okay so the completion looks right

[922.56 - 926.3199999999999] um i like how it's france the

[924.8 - 927.65] renaissance romance comedy cerebral

[926.32 - 928.8000000000001] suspenseful.txt

[927.65 - 930.8] [Laughter]

[928.8 - 932.8] you know exactly what you're getting um

[930.8 - 935.5999999999999] okay so that's good the completion looks

[932.8 - 938.24] right but i think the prompt is wrong

[935.6 - 940.5600000000001] yeah that's not what i wanted

[938.24 - 943.44] um okay so let's fix that

[940.56 - 945.1199999999999] let's um actually yeah let's just go

[943.44 - 946.9590000000001] ahead and delete that

[945.12 - 949.519] and delete the completion it'll

[946.959 - 951.5189999999999] regenerate it um anyways

[949.519 - 952.399] uh no don't keep it in no don't keep it

[951.519 - 955.519] in

[952.399 - 958.24] um okay so out prompt oh that's what i

[955.519 - 959.36] forgot to do so um you do the percent

[958.24 - 960.639] and then when you have multiple

[959.36 - 962.9590000000001] placeholders

[960.639 - 967.839] you need to do um you need to put it in

[962.959 - 969.5999999999999] an iterable like this so we do um

[967.839 - 973.36] period oh no

[969.6 - 974.399] genre look uh place

[973.36 - 976.16] period

[974.399 - 977.839] modifier

[976.16 - 979.759] so that should be right and that's that

[977.839 - 982.24] should be fully populated

[979.759 - 984.72] um okay so then let's run this again

[982.24 - 986.8] just to make sure

[984.72 - 990.639] let's make this a little bigger

[986.8 - 990.639] so here's the initial input

[993.04 - 998.0] and it'll take a second oh this is much

[994.8 - 998.959] longer much better much better okay

[998.0 - 1000.959] so

[998.959 - 1003.68] um here's the initial input

[1000.959 - 1005.92] here's how we're reformatting that input

[1003.68 - 1008.4799999999999] so it'll be like this and then this is

[1005.92 - 1010.7199999999999] the output when catherine de medici is

[1008.48 - 1012.48] widowed this is italy

[1010.72 - 1014.0790000000001] she's a skilled politician but not well

[1012.48 - 1016.24] loved so this is much longer this is

[1014.079 - 1017.3599999999999] what we would kind of want to see

[1016.24 - 1018.8] um

[1017.36 - 1021.6800000000001] so let's go make sure that the data

[1018.8 - 1025.039] looks right so the completion here it is

[1021.68 - 1027.9189999999999] um there we go completions and then

[1025.039 - 1029.76] prompts and there's the prompt um and so

[1027.919 - 1031.439] then what you do after this is you just

[1029.76 - 1032.72] you remove the escape

[1031.439 - 1034.72] um and you let it go and you've

[1032.72 - 1036.16] synthesized data and we are at 17

[1034.72 - 1038.4] minutes so this is a little bit longer

[1036.16 - 1040.64] than i try and make my tutorials

[1038.4 - 1041.919] so the last thing is just do this and

[1040.64 - 1043.8390000000002] let it run

[1041.919 - 1047.039] so i will go ahead and set this to run

[1043.839 - 1049.12] and then tune in for the next video

[1047.039 - 1050.64] where we'll go over data prep and i

[1049.12 - 1052.9599999999998] think probably what i'll do is talk

[1050.64 - 1054.0] about data augmentation and cleanup at

[1052.96 - 1056.24] that time because that's all part of

[1054.0 - 1058.48] data prep so anyways thanks for watching

[1056.24 - 1061.48] tune in again and i'll see you all again

[1058.48 - 1061.48] soon
