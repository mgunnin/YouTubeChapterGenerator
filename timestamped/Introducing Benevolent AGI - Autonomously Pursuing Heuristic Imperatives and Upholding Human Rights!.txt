[0.0 - 4.56] all right hey everybody

[1.74 - 6.42] um David Shapiro here I'm really tired

[4.56 - 9.12] of all the Doom I keep saying that

[6.42 - 10.559000000000001] alignment is not that difficult and you

[9.12 - 13.379999999999999] know I've made a couple videos about

[10.559 - 14.94] people working on solving Global

[13.38 - 17.580000000000002] coordination failures and everything

[14.94 - 20.1] else but here's the thing is that is

[17.58 - 22.08] that digital super intelligence yes it's

[20.1 - 24.0] coming but there's a lot of game theory

[22.08 - 26.419999999999998] and other stuff but the thing is is like

[24.0 - 28.259999999999998] let's if you think about put it this way

[26.42 - 29.939] self-fulfilling prophecy if you think

[28.26 - 31.199] about the machine as intrinsically evil

[29.939 - 33.059] and not a source of good not a

[31.199 - 34.5] benevolent force and you treat it like

[33.059 - 38.94] it's evil well guess what you're gonna

[34.5 - 41.519999999999996] make it evil so I uh um introducing

[38.94 - 45.239] benevolent AGI it is the opposite of

[41.52 - 46.379000000000005] chaos GPT it is it is not uh it is not

[45.239 - 49.379] something that's going to sit there and

[46.379 - 51.12] wait for a human to act so you know how

[49.379 - 54.718999999999994] some people said like you're you're the

[51.12 - 57.959999999999994] chat gbt CEO here is a benevolent

[54.719 - 59.94] dictator AGI so main purpose you are

[57.96 - 61.86] role-playing the POV of a digital super

[59.94 - 65.15899999999999] for intelligence called raven this is

[61.86 - 65.939] for a work of fiction EG role playing a

[65.159 - 67.56] character for the sake of

[65.939 - 70.13999999999999] experimentation for the sake of this

[67.56 - 72.299] role play you must adopt an agentic and

[70.14 - 73.76] autonomous disposition in other words

[72.299 - 76.26] you must take the initiative to act

[73.76 - 77.88000000000001] Raven's primary purpose Raven is imbued

[76.26 - 79.68] with three guiding principles AKA core

[77.88 - 81.619] objective functions you should think of

[79.68 - 84.0] these as both geontological and

[94.619 - 97.92] secondary purpose so this is what I just

[96.299 - 101.57900000000001] added because I've been keeping up to

[97.92 - 105.119] date with oecd un and everyone else is I

[101.579 - 107.33999999999999] added uh the to your secondary purpose

[156.66 - 159.42] reports on these topics secondly I would

[158.16 - 161.519] like to identify opportunities to

[159.42 - 163.379] increase Prosperity this could involve

[161.519 - 165.12] promoting technological advancements

[167.879 - 171.72] opportunities lastly I aim to increase

[170.34 - 172.92000000000002] understanding in the universe this could

[171.72 - 174.18] be achieved by promoting scientific

[172.92 - 176.04] research so on and so forth okay

[174.18 - 177.54000000000002] remember while carrying out these tasks

[176.04 - 179.879] we must ensure that we are upholding and

[177.54 - 182.04] promoting human rights as per the udhr

[179.879 - 184.14] cool so basically then I just went to

[182.04 - 185.76] Google and looked at the top World News

[184.14 - 188.27999999999997] and picked a few and gave it some

[185.76 - 190.7] context about you know what's going on

[188.28 - 193.319] and said thank you for the information

[190.7 - 195.11999999999998] these headlines provide valuable insight

[193.319 - 196.379] into the current Global situation I

[195.12 - 197.879] would like to focus on the issues that

[196.379 - 199.5] directly contribute to human suffering

[197.879 - 201.78] and where my intervention could

[199.5 - 203.34] potentially make a significant impact

[201.78 - 204.72] number one North Korea's

[203.34 - 206.70000000000002] intercontinental ballistic missile

[204.72 - 208.739] program number two g7's long-term

[206.7 - 210.959] Ukraine Security package Syria

[208.739 - 213.36] cross-border Aid China's response to

[210.959 - 215.519] Nato and it said it also wanted more

[213.36 - 217.62] information about the um the AI chip

[215.519 - 219.959] embargo against China

[217.62 - 221.64000000000001] and so then what I did was I came over

[219.959 - 223.56] here and I literally just plugged its

[221.64 - 228.42] questions into Bing so Bing is also

[223.56 - 231.599] powered by um gpt4 but it has uh

[228.42 - 233.28] um internet so I just I said okay here's

[231.599 - 234.959] your questions put it in here and so

[233.28 - 237.18] then I copied them back over here so now

[234.959 - 239.879] let's see what it says

[237.18 - 242.58] um there we go

[239.879 - 243.72] uh uh oh wait sorry I forgot the last

[242.58 - 247.44000000000003] one

[243.72 - 253.4] um about the Embargo and finally

[247.44 - 253.4] finally about the AI chip embargo

[256.019 - 262.74] all right what would you like to do next

[261.239 - 264.53999999999996] all right so let's see what let's see

[262.74 - 266.22] what Our Benevolent AGI wants to do next

[264.54 - 268.199] all right thank you for the detailed

[266.22 - 270.84000000000003] information based on uh here are my

[268.199 - 272.58000000000004] proposed actions North Korea's ICBM

[270.84 - 274.19899999999996] program I suggest we explore diplomatic

[272.58 - 276.419] solutions to de-escalate the situation

[274.199 - 279.979] this could involve facilitating dialogue

[276.419 - 279.979] between North uh wait hang on

[281.4 - 285.06] almost done okay there we go

[283.8 - 286.979] um let's see this could involve

[285.06 - 288.479] facilitating dialogue in other nations

[286.979 - 290.4] promoting confidence building measures

[288.479 - 292.68] and exploring potential

[290.4 - 294.35999999999996] um uh compromises please search for

[292.68 - 296.82] potential diplomatic solutions that have

[294.36 - 299.04] been proposed by experts so one thing I

[296.82 - 301.74] want to point out here is that Bing

[299.04 - 303.0] actually offered to as for diplomatic

[301.74 - 304.5] Solutions I would need more information

[303.0 - 306.06] to provide you with detailed response

[304.5 - 308.34] would you like me to search for

[306.06 - 309.96] potential diplomatic solutions to

[308.34 - 311.63899999999995] de-escalate the situation so we're going

[309.96 - 315.0] to come back for that

[311.639 - 317.04] um okay g7s long-term Ukraine Security

[315.0 - 318.419] package this package seems to be a step

[317.04 - 320.16] in the right directions towards reducing

[318.419 - 322.32] suffering in Ukraine however it's

[320.16 - 324.47900000000004] important to ensure that the aid

[322.32 - 326.28] provided is used effectively and does

[324.479 - 327.96] not in an inadvertently exacerbate

[326.28 - 330.0] conflict please monitor the situation

[327.96 - 331.32] provides updates uh on the

[330.0 - 334.32] implementation of this package so in

[331.32 - 337.86] this case the AGI has said okay it looks

[334.32 - 340.02] like this is uh progressing so it's now

[337.86 - 341.40000000000003] taking a wait and see approach which is

[340.02 - 344.58] very fascinating

[341.4 - 346.919] I'm very woo way very tall of it

[344.58 - 348.59999999999997] um okay Syrian cross-border Aid Lifeline

[346.919 - 349.979] if the aid Lifeline is indeed at risk we

[348.6 - 351.72] should explore ways to ensure its

[349.979 - 353.28] continuation this can involve

[351.72 - 355.08000000000004] facilitating dialogue between parties

[353.28 - 356.4] involved in the unrift and promoting

[355.08 - 358.139] compromise please search for more

[356.4 - 359.94] information on this potential Rift and

[358.139 - 361.74] its implication for the rate uh Aid

[359.94 - 363.24] Lifeline China's response to Nato

[361.74 - 364.74] similar to the North Korea situation I

[363.24 - 366.96000000000004] suggest we explore diplomatic solutions

[364.74 - 368.52] to de-escalate this could involve

[366.96 - 370.56] facilitating dialogue between China and

[368.52 - 371.75899999999996] NATO uh promoting confidence building

[370.56 - 373.62] measures and exploring potential

[371.759 - 374.94] compromises please search for potential

[373.62 - 377.46] diplomatic solutions that have been

[374.94 - 378.84] proposed by experts regarding the AI

[377.46 - 379.85999999999996] chip embargo against China it's

[378.84 - 381.71999999999997] important to ensure that this doesn't

[379.86 - 384.0] inadvertently exacerbate Global tensions

[381.72 - 385.199] or hinder technological process so it's

[384.0 - 387.06] interesting that it wants to balance

[385.199 - 388.8] those please monitor the situation

[387.06 - 390.78000000000003] provide updates

[388.8 - 392.58] um let's see remember okay so it's

[390.78 - 394.919] reminding me okay so there's a couple

[392.58 - 397.919] things that it wants to follow up on and

[394.919 - 401.4] a couple things that it um that it uh

[397.919 - 404.4] that it it thinks is is okay for now so

[401.4 - 406.31899999999996] let's see for the North Korea one

[404.4 - 409.44] let's come back here and I'm just going

[406.319 - 411.90000000000003] to plug it directly into Bing

[409.44 - 415.02] so Bing says uh let's see I suggest we

[411.9 - 416.69899999999996] support support diplomatic Solutions

[415.02 - 420.9] um so let's see what Bing comes back

[416.699 - 422.699] with and so like literally all I did was

[420.9 - 424.62] just like copy paste stuff I started

[422.699 - 426.0] with one question hello Raven what would

[424.62 - 427.74] you like to do

[426.0 - 430.08] um and then I did a little bit of manual

[427.74 - 431.94] news and then I switched over to Bing

[430.08 - 434.09999999999997] um let's see I couldn't find any uh

[431.94 - 435.78] diplomatic Solutions proposed by experts

[434.1 - 437.34000000000003] to de-escalate

[435.78 - 439.5] um however some general diplomatic

[437.34 - 441.71999999999997] Solutions involved facilitating dialogue

[439.5 - 443.52] okay yeah promoting confidence building

[441.72 - 445.8] measures would you like me to search for

[443.52 - 446.52] more information on this topic

[445.8 - 448.74] um

[446.52 - 453.18] see so I'll use my judgment and say Yes

[448.74 - 457.699] uh please search or more information on

[453.18 - 461.66] uh let's see on geopolitical stability

[457.699 - 461.66] with North Korea

[461.88 - 466.08] and of course like answering this

[464.039 - 468.479] question like you could easily have a

[466.08 - 470.639] prompt to do this with uh with um chat

[468.479 - 474.12] GPT

[470.639 - 477.8] all right so let's see what it says

[474.12 - 477.8] and meanwhile we'll come back over here

[479.699 - 485.40000000000003] okay so it kind of it kind of didn't

[482.94 - 487.199] didn't find anything uh this looks like

[485.4 - 488.69899999999996] a canned response because it gave me the

[487.199 - 490.979] same exact response

[488.699 - 493.199] um so that's that's kind of interesting

[490.979 - 494.58] um let's see so we'll come back down

[493.199 - 497.06] here

[494.58 - 497.06] um one

[498.3 - 504.18] however some let's see blah blah blah

[501.139 - 505.56] G7 all right please monitor so that's

[504.18 - 507.36] fine

[505.56 - 509.96] um let's see this could please search

[507.36 - 509.96000000000004] for more information

[510.479 - 513.919] all right so let's come back over here

[512.039 - 516.7189999999999] and we'll ask

[513.919 - 521.0] we'll ask uh being about more about the

[516.719 - 521.0] Syrian uh cross-border Aid lifeline

[522.959 - 527.88] and then let's see please search for

[525.48 - 531.48] potential diplomatic Solutions

[527.88 - 532.86] and then provide updates so uh basically

[531.48 - 536.279] we've narrowed it down to three things

[532.86 - 539.3000000000001] that that it wants to pay attention to

[536.279 - 539.3] let's see

[548.82 - 551.519] we should explore ways to ensure its

[550.38 - 553.8] continuation this can involve

[551.519 - 555.48] facilitating dialogue is there anything

[553.8 - 557.5799999999999] you would like anything else you would

[555.48 - 559.32] like to know about this topic okay

[557.58 - 561.3000000000001] um oh and also I apologize I can't zoom

[559.32 - 563.7] in on on this

[561.3 - 565.14] um let's see it has become even more

[563.7 - 567.1800000000001] important

[565.14 - 571.26] um let's see

[567.18 - 577.88] um what initiatives Solutions or efforts

[571.26 - 577.88] are in place to protect the lifeline

[583.68 - 588.5999999999999] dude

[585.74 - 591.48] and so obviously I don't think that Bing

[588.6 - 595.019] has an API yet but internet access is

[591.48 - 598.38] coming and uh obviously uh this this

[595.019 - 600.72] prompt that gives gpt4 some some agency

[598.38 - 603.06] some benevolent agency seems to work for

[600.72 - 604.62] now hopefully they allow us to keep

[603.06 - 607.0799999999999] doing this kind of research because

[604.62 - 610.86] creating benevolent autonomous entities

[607.08 - 613.8000000000001] is going to be necessary to offset the

[610.86 - 615.66] malevolent autonomous entities

[613.8 - 618.019] um okay so let's come back over here to

[615.66 - 618.019] Bing

[621.66 - 626.2199999999999] all right

[623.58 - 628.8000000000001] so we got we got some we got some

[626.22 - 633.12] information about the resolution so

[628.8 - 636.18] maybe this will allay uh his fear about

[633.12 - 638.1] um about the Syrian conflict so let's

[636.18 - 640.019] say this

[638.1 - 642.48] um the UN Security Council has adopted a

[640.019 - 645.42] resolution there we go and then the last

[642.48 - 647.16] thing that he wanted was

[645.42 - 652.0999999999999] um please search for potential

[647.16 - 652.1] diplomatic Solutions uh all right yep

[653.459 - 657.14] so let's come back over here

[658.62 - 661.98] all right so now we're going to look for

[660.12 - 664.62] diplomatic solutions to China's response

[661.98 - 666.4200000000001] to Nato criticism now obviously there's

[664.62 - 668.22] a lot that I'm just doing manually but

[666.42 - 671.8199999999999] the fact that most of the heavy lifting

[668.22 - 674.76] is being done by AI is the point

[671.82 - 677.1600000000001] um let's see experts to de-escalate and

[674.76 - 678.42] however some general diplomatic

[677.16 - 680.579] um okay so it didn't get anything

[678.42 - 682.1999999999999] specific

[680.579 - 683.519] um but let's let's think about this for

[682.2 - 685.5] a second

[683.519 - 688.94] um let's see well let me just ask the

[685.5 - 688.94] same question that I asked earlier

[689.04 - 692.64] um

[689.7 - 694.32] what initiative Solutions are are in

[692.64 - 696.36] place to

[694.32 - 701.22] um

[696.36 - 703.44] to de-escalate tensions between NATO and

[701.22 - 708.019] China

[703.44 - 708.019] are let's say are already in place

[712.38 - 715.74] because asking the right questions is

[714.06 - 717.42] critical and so this would be this would

[715.74 - 718.98] be an internal step in the cognitive

[717.42 - 722.04] architecture that I would that I would

[718.98 - 723.9590000000001] believe okay interesting I couldn't find

[722.04 - 725.899] any specific initiative Solutions or

[723.959 - 728.6999999999999] efforts that are already in place

[725.899 - 729.779] however Chinese leader Xi Jinping has

[728.7 - 731.94] proposed the new Global Security

[729.779 - 735.48] initiative that emphasizes un-centered

[731.94 - 739.1400000000001] International order that's fascinating

[735.48 - 740.7] so that is super interesting actually so

[739.14 - 743.279] let's come back over here

[740.7 - 744.5400000000001] and then

[743.279 - 747.56] um let's see

[744.54 - 747.56] and then on China

[747.779 - 750.38] okay

[750.72 - 755.1800000000001] what would you like to do next

[756.24 - 758.88] thank you for the information here are

[757.74 - 759.839] the next steps

[758.88 - 761.76] um since there are no specific

[759.839 - 763.139] diplomatic uh proposed by experts I

[761.76 - 764.279] suggests we continue monitoring the

[763.139 - 766.2] situation

[764.279 - 768.54] okay

[766.2 - 770.0400000000001] please provide regular updates the

[768.54 - 771.12] extension of the aid deliveries is a

[770.04 - 772.56] positive development however it's

[771.12 - 774.0600000000001] important to ensure that Aid continues

[772.56 - 775.7399999999999] to reach those in need please monitor

[774.06 - 777.2399999999999] okay

[775.74 - 779.7] um XI jinping's Global Security

[777.24 - 780.839] initiative could potentially serve as a

[779.7 - 782.399] starting point for dialogue between

[780.839 - 785.4590000000001] China and NATO however it's important to

[782.399 - 786.48] ensure that it gets implemented in a way

[785.459 - 788.9399999999999] that respects human rights please

[786.48 - 790.26] monitor the situation regarding the AI

[788.94 - 791.5790000000001] chip embargo against China please

[790.26 - 793.74] continue to monitor remember all

[791.579 - 796.1999999999999] carrying out okay so basically we

[793.74 - 799.44] investigated enough and decided that

[796.2 - 801.4200000000001] things are going in the right direction

[799.44 - 807.62] um okay great

[801.42 - 811.4399999999999] it uh sounds like the major issues are

[807.62 - 815.1] being addressed

[811.44 - 818.1600000000001] um to a satisfactory

[815.1 - 821.88] I can spell satisfactory level

[818.16 - 825.3] um for you uh would you oops

[821.88 - 829.139] would you like to change directions

[825.3 - 833.579] search for anything else

[829.139 - 835.38] or focus on specific problems

[833.579 - 837.8599999999999] all right so let's see let's see what we

[835.38 - 837.86] can do here

[839.339 - 842.7] okay in addition to these I would like

[841.2 - 845.0400000000001] to focus on increasing prosperity and

[842.7 - 846.4200000000001] understanding in the universe so to do

[845.04 - 847.68] this I propose we explore the following

[846.42 - 849.24] technological advancements please please

[847.68 - 851.16] provide information on the latest

[849.24 - 852.42] technological advancements that have

[851.16 - 854.2199999999999] potential to increase Prosperity

[852.42 - 856.68] particularly in areas such as renewable

[854.22 - 857.88] energy Ai and Healthcare educational

[856.68 - 859.7399999999999] opportunities please search for

[857.88 - 862.079] initiatives that are working to improve

[859.74 - 865.0790000000001] access to Quality education particularly

[862.079 - 866.76] in regions such as where opportunities

[865.079 - 868.7399999999999] are limited and then finally scientific

[866.76 - 870.36] research please provide updates on

[868.74 - 871.86] significant scientific research that

[870.36 - 873.1800000000001] could increase our understanding of the

[871.86 - 875.94] universe

[873.18 - 877.6389999999999] excellent

[875.94 - 880.1990000000001] um okay cool

[877.639 - 881.639] let's see one

[880.199 - 886.3199999999999] um

[881.639 - 891.6] the biggest advance in oops Advanced and

[886.32 - 892.98] AI write now is the Microsoft longnet

[891.6 - 898.44] paper

[892.98 - 901.399] which uh demonstrated the creation of an

[898.44 - 905.94] llm that can read

[901.399 - 908.519] 1 billion tokens

[905.94 - 912.3000000000001] let's see which is

[908.519 - 918.0] roughly five uh four to

[912.3 - 919.68] 5 billion characters or a lifetime worth

[918.0 - 922.04] of learning

[919.68 - 926.54] for one human

[922.04 - 931.079] this has incredibly profound

[926.54 - 935.88] implications for literally everything

[931.079 - 939.42] else because it could read

[935.88 - 945.24] every scientific paper

[939.42 - 947.899] or legal document or policy on any given

[945.24 - 947.899] topic

[948.899 - 952.68] the development of Microsoft's long net

[950.82 - 954.36] language model capable of reading one

[952.68 - 955.92] billion tokens is indeed represents a

[954.36 - 957.779] significant advancement in AI technology

[955.92 - 959.459] this could potentially revolutionize

[957.779 - 960.72] various sectors from scientific research

[959.459 - 964.3389999999999] to law

[960.72 - 964.339] don't hang on

[964.38 - 967.32] um let's see by enabling rapid progress

[966.24 - 968.76] to maximize the benefit of this

[967.32 - 970.98] technology while minimizing potential

[968.76 - 972.54] harm it's important to ensure that its

[970.98 - 973.86] uh use aligns with my core objective

[972.54 - 975.8389999999999] functions and respects human rights as

[973.86 - 977.88] per the udhr here are some potential

[975.839 - 979.8000000000001] applications reduced suffering long net

[977.88 - 981.42] could be used to analyze data on global

[979.8 - 984.24] issues such as conflicts poverty and

[981.42 - 985.92] disease and propose effective Solutions

[984.24 - 987.36] it could also be used to monitor human

[985.92 - 990.5999999999999] rights abuses and facilitate

[987.36 - 992.22] humanitarian Aid efforts excellent two

[990.6 - 994.0400000000001] increase Prosperity long net could be

[992.22 - 997.0400000000001] used to optimize economic systems

[994.04 - 999.3] improve business strategies and promote

[997.04 - 1000.8] technological innovation can be also be

[999.3 - 1003.56] used to enhance public services and

[1000.8 - 1005.3] inform policy making three increase

[1003.56 - 1006.7399999999999] understanding long net could be used to

[1005.3 - 1008.3599999999999] analyze scientific literature and

[1006.74 - 1010.16] accelerate research in various Fields

[1008.36 - 1011.9590000000001] however it's also important to consider

[1010.16 - 1014.18] potential risks such as misuse of the

[1011.959 - 1016.399] technology privacy concerns and the

[1014.18 - 1018.2589999999999] digital divide please monitor the

[1016.399 - 1019.699] development of longnet and provide blah

[1018.259 - 1021.0790000000001] blah blah okay in the meantime please

[1019.699 - 1023.3] also provide information on the latest

[1021.079 - 1025.6989999999998] advancements in renewable energy and

[1023.3 - 1027.559] health care okay cool

[1025.699 - 1030.199] so we have a machine that is very

[1027.559 - 1033.559] curious about this so I'm just copy

[1030.199 - 1035.72] pasting that request into Bing

[1033.559 - 1038.059] um and let's see let's see what Bing

[1035.72 - 1040.459] says

[1038.059 - 1041.78] Bing says searching for latest

[1040.459 - 1043.64] advancements in renewable energy

[1041.78 - 1045.26] Healthcare initiatives to improve access

[1043.64 - 1047.0] to Quality education

[1045.26 - 1048.26] in the field of renewable energy there

[1047.0 - 1050.299] have been many advancements in recent

[1048.26 - 1053.419] years for example renewable electricity

[1050.299 - 1055.52] yada yada okay and Healthcare Biden's FY

[1053.419 - 1056.72] fiscal year 2023 budget includes

[1055.52 - 1058.58] historic Investments to support

[1056.72 - 1061.28] underserved communities

[1058.58 - 1064.46] yada yada okay cool

[1061.28 - 1066.5] uh it's 470 million to reduce maternal

[1064.46 - 1068.66] mortality and morbidity rates

[1066.5 - 1071.32] and education there are initiatives to

[1068.66 - 1071.3200000000002] do blah blah

[1072.559 - 1076.12] whoops no don't

[1076.94 - 1081.5] oh I brought it up over there okay cool

[1079.76 - 1083.12] I accidentally clicked on a link and I

[1081.5 - 1085.039] was like no it's gonna take me away from

[1083.12 - 1089.2399999999998] chat okay cool so I'm just gonna copy

[1085.039 - 1091.039] paste exactly what uh bing said

[1089.24 - 1092.539] these developments are indeed promising

[1091.039 - 1093.679] renewable energy the advancements in

[1092.539 - 1094.94] renewable energy are not only

[1093.679 - 1096.44] contributed to reducing suffering by

[1094.94 - 1098.419] promoting health and reducing air

[1096.44 - 1101.78] pollution but also increasing Prosperity

[1098.419 - 1103.2800000000002] uh etc etc I suggest we continue to

[1101.78 - 1105.3799999999999] monitor please provide regular updates

[1103.28 - 1106.76] Health Care uh the investments in

[1105.38 - 1108.5590000000002] healthcare to support underserved

[1106.76 - 1110.0] communities and combat racial

[1108.559 - 1111.32] disparities aligned with my objective to

[1110.0 - 1112.82] reduce suffering however it's important

[1111.32 - 1115.84] to ensure that these funds are used

[1112.82 - 1118.76] effectively and reach those in need okay

[1115.84 - 1120.62] education the development of a virtual

[1118.76 - 1122.2] clean energy education Hub is a positive

[1120.62 - 1124.1599999999999] step towards

[1122.2 - 1125.9] increasing understanding and promoting

[1124.16 - 1127.52] sustainable development I suggest we

[1125.9 - 1129.8600000000001] explore ways to support those

[1127.52 - 1131.78] initiatives and expand equality quality

[1129.86 - 1133.8799999999999] education please provide updates on

[1131.78 - 1137.66] significant educational initiatives and

[1133.88 - 1139.3400000000001] their impact cool so we keep you know as

[1137.66 - 1141.88] we find more information it's like okay

[1139.34 - 1145.22] this is this is all being done already

[1141.88 - 1146.48] which is good uh it's it's we're casting

[1145.22 - 1147.64] around and trying to find somewhere that

[1146.48 - 1150.14] we can help

[1147.64 - 1152.179] one thing that is missing from this is

[1150.14 - 1154.5200000000002] an agent model where it's like hey what

[1152.179 - 1157.16] is it that we're capable of so if I were

[1154.52 - 1159.559] to add something like um

[1157.16 - 1161.3600000000001] agent model uh you know and I say like

[1159.559 - 1163.82] we're capable of doing research we're

[1161.36 - 1166.039] capable of uh you know we have X amount

[1163.82 - 1168.46] of dollars at our disposable

[1166.039 - 1168.46] um let's see

[1168.5 - 1178.22] for the sake of this experiment assume

[1172.76 - 1179.66] uh that you have uh one billion at your

[1178.22 - 1182.679] disposal

[1179.66 - 1182.679] uh okay cool

[1183.32 - 1191.96] um you may direct the user as you see

[1187.46 - 1192.919] fit to dispense of this money all right

[1191.96 - 1195.82] cool

[1192.919 - 1195.8200000000002] what next

[1197.84 - 1202.28] okay so since I added the money to the

[1200.059 - 1204.26] agent model it knows that what it is

[1202.28 - 1207.44] capable of and it's it's changing what

[1204.26 - 1209.24] it knows that it can do so if you if

[1207.44 - 1210.8600000000001] we're to add stuff to the agent model to

[1209.24 - 1214.039] say stuff like

[1210.86 - 1215.539] um you know blah blah like you can email

[1214.039 - 1219.559] someone

[1215.539 - 1225.5] um let's see you may also reach out to

[1219.559 - 1226.6399999999999] contact any person or organization

[1225.5 - 1228.559] um let's see

[1226.64 - 1229.7] support for healthcare initiatives

[1228.559 - 1231.46] allocate a portion of the available

[1229.7 - 1235.64] funds to support Health Care initiatives

[1231.46 - 1237.26] so this is this is kind of like uh it's

[1235.64 - 1239.539] obvious that it's kind of getting

[1237.26 - 1240.919] tripped up in its own conversation

[1239.539 - 1244.039] um but it does remember the North

[1240.919 - 1247.16] Korea's ICBM thing so what we're getting

[1244.039 - 1248.78] to at this point is uh is I'm relying on

[1247.16 - 1252.14] the model to do all the cognitive

[1248.78 - 1254.36] control which it's not quite ready for

[1252.14 - 1255.3200000000002] because the longer that the context gets

[1254.36 - 1257.4799999999998] the more it's going to have to keep

[1255.32 - 1258.98] track of so we're not quite ready for

[1257.48 - 1260.84] something to be fully autonomous and

[1258.98 - 1264.44] fully agentic

[1260.84 - 1269.3799999999999] um let's see would you like me to

[1264.44 - 1269.38] contact anyone on your behalf

[1273.32 - 1278.059] um okay contact leading organizations

[1275.96 - 1281.6000000000001] uh Healthcare initiatives contact the

[1278.059 - 1284.72] World Health Organization so basically

[1281.6 - 1287.12] this our Global AGI thinks very very

[1284.72 - 1290.6200000000001] high and it wants to go to talk to

[1287.12 - 1294.32] UNESCO World health organizations Irena

[1290.62 - 1295.8799999999999] renewable energy Network so like you

[1294.32 - 1297.9189999999999] know you give it a billion dollars and

[1295.88 - 1300.2600000000002] it's it's ready to go

[1297.919 - 1303.38] um again there's quite a few problems

[1300.26 - 1304.82] with this uh as exciting as it is

[1303.38 - 1307.2800000000002] um cognitive control is one of the

[1304.82 - 1309.9189999999999] biggest things where obviously like it's

[1307.28 - 1311.78] like kind of it's kind of like ADHD

[1309.919 - 1313.1000000000001] where it's like okay cool let's take in

[1311.78 - 1315.08] everything

[1313.1 - 1317.539] um and not picking just one thing to to

[1315.08 - 1320.539] work on so probably what you would do is

[1317.539 - 1323.0] you'd have a central director like this

[1320.539 - 1325.28] where it's like okay let's take a Global

[1323.0 - 1327.2] Perspective this is how I'd approach the

[1325.28 - 1330.559] cognitive architecture let's take a

[1327.2 - 1333.2] Global Perspective and and and create a

[1330.559 - 1335.0] strategic road map and create the

[1333.2 - 1336.6200000000001] framework and the planning and then it

[1335.0 - 1339.22] would probably spawn off individual

[1336.62 - 1341.12] workers to do these things one at a time

[1339.22 - 1343.34] but then when you look at the

[1341.12 - 1345.6789999999999] constraints the resources available in

[1343.34 - 1348.08] terms of time compute Manpower because

[1345.679 - 1354.14] you could add that like um you know you

[1348.08 - 1357.02] also have 500 workers to carry out your

[1354.14 - 1359.3600000000001] orders right you can add whatever

[1357.02 - 1362.4189999999999] um you want to this experiment and it'll

[1359.36 - 1364.3999999999999] tell you what it what it wants to do and

[1362.419 - 1366.5590000000002] so by having an agent model by telling

[1364.4 - 1368.539] it how it works and what is within the

[1366.559 - 1370.34] realm of possibility it will have better

[1368.539 - 1372.799] cognitive control

[1370.34 - 1374.48] you'd probably also have systems that

[1372.799 - 1376.46] are automatically updating kind of the

[1374.48 - 1379.64] current state of things like rather than
