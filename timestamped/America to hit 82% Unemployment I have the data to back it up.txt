[0.659 - 4.74] all right so there's a bit to unpack

[2.76 - 7.02] here but before we get started I want to

[4.74 - 9.780000000000001] uh profess this whole thing with take it

[7.02 - 12.12] with a gigantic grain of salt uh my

[9.78 - 16.32] methods are highly dubious and my data

[12.12 - 17.46] quality is uh abysmal let's say but it's

[16.32 - 18.9] an interesting thought experiment so

[17.46 - 20.039] let's dive in

[18.9 - 22.38] um all right so we'll start with the

[20.039 - 26.519000000000002] conclusion and then work backwards

[22.38 - 29.099] so right now at least May 2022 so just

[26.519 - 33.6] over a year ago 13 months ago America

[29.099 - 37.94] had 147 million employees ish 148

[33.6 - 41.879000000000005] million now based on the current

[37.94 - 43.68] capabilities of AI what this includes

[41.879 - 45.86] all machine automation robotics

[43.68 - 49.44] artificial intelligence

[45.86 - 54.0] my estimate is that we could automate

[49.44 - 58.32] away almost 25 million jobs today

[54.0 - 60.3] now that requires the deployment of new

[58.32 - 62.879] products and services so those products

[60.3 - 65.64] and services do not exist yet but the

[62.879 - 68.15899999999999] underpinning technology does which means

[65.64 - 70.74] that the only thing preventing us from

[68.159 - 73.08000000000001] from getting that employment is just

[70.74 - 75.29899999999999] inertia the time that it takes to

[73.08 - 77.82] develop the products and software

[75.299 - 79.43900000000001] the time to get it approved and the time

[77.82 - 83.52] to implement it and then make those

[79.439 - 85.86] changes so as of right now almost 25

[83.52 - 89.22] million jobs are vulnerable to AI with

[85.86 - 92.1] the capabilities of GPT 3.5 turbo and

[89.22 - 94.74] gpt4 and then of course all the other

[92.1 - 97.439] open source uh and and Commercial

[94.74 - 101.88] competitors that are near peer

[97.439 - 105.0] adversaries now that being said if you

[101.88 - 107.479] look at the jobs that uh based on a

[105.0 - 110.579] job's intrinsic requirement for humans

[107.479 - 112.14] uh basically you look at the the kinds

[110.579 - 114.65899999999999] of jobs that you're going to pay to have

[112.14 - 117.06] a person doing regardless of what the AI

[114.659 - 118.43900000000001] is capable of this is these are the jobs

[117.06 - 120.259] that are going to be vulnerable just by

[118.439 - 123.89899999999999] virtue of the fact that you don't really

[120.259 - 126.6] necessarily need a human doing it the

[123.899 - 128.819] numbers become a little bit scarier and

[126.6 - 133.01999999999998] uh my estimate this is worst case

[128.819 - 135.72] scenario is that in the near future 77

[133.02 - 138.12] million jobs out of the 140 seven

[135.72 - 139.62] million jobs are vulnerable to be to

[138.12 - 142.92000000000002] being automated away

[139.62 - 145.68] basically this calculation is a rough

[142.92 - 147.83999999999997] estimate on market demand how much do

[145.68 - 149.4] you actually want a human doing that

[147.84 - 151.14000000000001] particular job

[149.4 - 154.8] which means that in the worst case

[151.14 - 158.45899999999997] scenario we go from 148 million employed

[154.8 - 161.4] to 70 million employed that is more than

[158.459 - 163.739] 50 percent lost so I have been

[161.4 - 166.5] repeatedly saying you know we could face

[163.739 - 168.59900000000002] 70 unemployment 80 and other people say

[166.5 - 170.459] 80 unemployment here's the numbers to

[168.599 - 172.07999999999998] back it up all right now

[170.459 - 174.36] since I got your attention let me tell

[172.08 - 176.87900000000002] you how I did this and again remember

[174.36 - 178.86] this is incredibly dubious so take it

[176.879 - 182.17999999999998] with a huge grain of salt but basically

[178.86 - 185.09900000000002] what I did was I took the

[182.18 - 187.31900000000002] gpt40613 model

[185.099 - 190.44] and I gave it instructions I said you

[187.319 - 192.89999999999998] are a BLS chat bot and you're trying to

[190.44 - 193.85999999999999] assess the risk of having jobs automated

[192.9 - 197.519] away

[193.86 - 202.44000000000003] uh yada yada yada the tldr is that I

[197.519 - 204.9] asked it to uh judge jobs or occupations

[202.44 - 207.72] based on job activities and I had it

[204.9 - 209.81900000000002] break it down into percentages uh based

[207.72 - 212.64] on three categories so the first

[209.819 - 215.7] category is is dexterity so this is high

[212.64 - 218.64] friction uh in in physical space that

[215.7 - 220.67999999999998] requires compliance uh manual dexterity

[218.64 - 223.319] uh kinetic intelligence that sort of

[220.68 - 225.72] stuff because yes we do have a few

[223.319 - 227.64] robots that can do this but there are as

[225.72 - 230.099] of right now no general purpose robots

[227.64 - 232.319] that are capable of operating anywhere

[230.099 - 234.54] near human level in terms of dexterity

[232.319 - 236.22] there are no general purpose surgical

[234.54 - 240.06] robots there are no general purpose

[236.22 - 242.4] labor robots uh just doesn't exist

[240.06 - 244.379] now that being said you can robotically

[242.4 - 246.48000000000002] automate like a skid steer or a tractor

[244.379 - 248.159] or something that's fine that's not what

[246.48 - 250.07999999999998] I'm talking about

[248.159 - 252.54] um I'm talking about what a human can do

[250.08 - 254.459] with your hands and body and then the

[252.54 - 256.079] second category is solo work so this is

[254.459 - 259.139] work that can be done in front of a

[256.079 - 261.959] computer or otherwise electronically by

[259.139 - 264.12] yourself uh you know on your phone on a

[261.959 - 266.1] computer that sort of thing and then the

[264.12 - 267.9] third category of job activities is

[266.1 - 270.54] group stuff so this is communication

[267.9 - 271.79999999999995] collaboration face-to-face time with

[270.54 - 274.04] other humans

[271.8 - 277.62] and so those three categories break down

[274.04 - 280.38] and and kind of Judge the that's part of

[277.62 - 283.56] what I use to judge the vulnerability of

[280.38 - 285.96] a job so if it if it has low dexterity

[283.56 - 288.419] it is much at much greater risk of being

[285.96 - 292.08] automated away uh just with today's

[288.419 - 294.12] technology uh if it is mostly solo work

[292.08 - 296.4] it is much higher risk of being

[294.12 - 298.199] automated away and if it's a high group

[296.4 - 300.479] activity then it's a much lower risk

[298.199 - 302.58000000000004] because that indicates that the human

[300.479 - 304.68] com the human connection component is a

[302.58 - 306.71999999999997] big part of it and then finally the

[304.68 - 311.54] vulnerability score is a standalone

[306.72 - 314.46000000000004] score which is used to uh basically uh

[311.54 - 316.91900000000004] assess how how much you want a human

[314.46 - 318.78] doing that job what is the intrinsic uh

[316.919 - 320.69899999999996] need for that job and if the number is

[318.78 - 323.4] lower if that means it's less vulnerable

[320.699 - 325.56] which means you're more likely to really

[323.4 - 327.84] want to have a human in that job and

[325.56 - 330.0] you're willing to pay for that whereas

[327.84 - 331.61999999999995] if it's a high vulnerability score then

[330.0 - 334.5] that means that there's no intrinsic

[331.62 - 336.9] economic or personal or whatever there's

[334.5 - 338.6] no intrinsic demand to have a human in

[336.9 - 342.17999999999995] that job if you could automate it away

[338.6 - 344.699] then you might as well and so this is

[342.18 - 346.02] like machine shop workers right you

[344.699 - 348.479] don't need a whole heck of a lot of

[346.02 - 349.74] empathy or communication skills and I

[348.479 - 350.9] can hear all the machinists saying yeah

[349.74 - 354.0] like hell

[350.9 - 355.62] because machine is a machinists actually

[354.0 - 358.74] do have to do a tremendous amount of

[355.62 - 361.08] communication that being said the actual

[358.74 - 362.82] Hands-On machine stuff that that part

[361.08 - 364.919] could be automated away

[362.82 - 366.71999999999997] if of course the machines become more

[364.919 - 367.979] dexterous right because dexterity is a

[366.72 - 369.6] huge component of that so that's why I

[367.979 - 373.5] broke it down into these four categories

[369.6 - 375.66] of vulnerability and I had chat GPT just

[373.5 - 378.96] kind of do these rough estimates

[375.66 - 382.68] and it did a pretty good job using gpt4

[378.96 - 386.69899999999996] so I ran I downloaded the data from BLS

[382.68 - 388.5] and I excluded the detail in Broad ones

[386.699 - 390.84000000000003] because they're they're they're very

[388.5 - 393.3] very highly specific and I noticed that

[390.84 - 395.75899999999996] it was like okay the job duties really

[393.3 - 397.86] didn't change so I only focused on the

[395.759 - 399.41900000000004] minor and major categories which ended

[397.86 - 404.16] up being

[399.419 - 407.81899999999996] um let's see that was 116 categories so

[404.16 - 409.86] that's still 116 categories uh that it

[407.819 - 411.84000000000003] was used to estimate

[409.86 - 413.639] um in terms of vulnerability and I've

[411.84 - 417.35999999999996] got it all color coded so I'll tell you

[413.639 - 418.979] how to interpret the data in a second

[417.36 - 421.56] um here's the here's the thing so the

[418.979 - 422.88] first thing uh the first sorry good

[421.56 - 425.819] grief I'm going too fast here's the

[422.88 - 428.699] repository the first step of this is to

[425.819 - 430.68] break it down uh it just it's very very

[428.699 - 434.34000000000003] simple you open the data

[430.68 - 437.52] the CSV data pipe it in you get the

[434.34 - 439.44] result it pipes it back out in Json and

[437.52 - 442.4] I can show you an example of the debug

[439.44 - 444.9] here so I just it captures everything

[442.4 - 447.12] occupation code description and

[444.9 - 448.56] employment so that's what it gives it so

[447.12 - 450.3] that it understands and of course chat

[448.56 - 452.28000000000003] GPT already knows what all the

[450.3 - 454.5] occupation codes actually mean because

[452.28 - 456.78] it's baked into the training data and so

[454.5 - 459.08] if you go and talk to like chat gbt and

[456.78 - 462.11999999999995] say like hey what is BLS occupation code

[459.08 - 463.62] 17-1000 mean give me some examples and

[462.12 - 468.78000000000003] it'll it can give you a good explanation

[463.62 - 472.8] now one thing that I had it do was to in

[468.78 - 474.539] the output it actually tells me why it

[472.8 - 476.58] made the judgments that it did so this

[474.539 - 479.81899999999996] is where explainability comes in

[476.58 - 482.65999999999997] so uh here's an example of the final

[479.819 - 484.91900000000004] output for uh code

[482.66 - 488.03900000000004] 41-3000 sales representatives and

[484.919 - 491.52] services total current employment is 2.1

[488.039 - 493.74] million uh dexterity rather low you know

[491.52 - 495.599] you got to call some people

[493.74 - 497.099] um you know a significant portion of

[495.599 - 499.02] their work can be done solo on a

[497.099 - 500.94] computer such as managing customer

[499.02 - 503.039] databases and orders which make it

[500.94 - 504.9] susceptible to automation however a

[503.039 - 506.34] large part of their job about 60 percent

[504.9 - 507.599] involves group collaboration and

[506.34 - 509.81899999999996] communication such as face-to-face

[507.599 - 511.979] meetings negotiations which is difficult

[509.819 - 514.26] to automate the intrinsic technological

[511.979 - 517.1999999999999] vulnerability is estimated at 40 so it's

[514.26 - 519.18] a relatively low vulnerability uh job

[517.2 - 522.5390000000001] because yes there are some things that

[519.18 - 524.279] you can automate away but in general you

[522.539 - 526.62] want to be talking to a human sales rep

[524.279 - 529.4399999999999] it to close the deal

[526.62 - 531.779] so in this case uh the the numbers kind

[529.44 - 534.6600000000001] of all come together to say okay uh

[531.779 - 536.58] let's see we uh this estimated that we

[534.66 - 538.8] might lose about twenty six thousand

[536.58 - 542.64] jobs

[538.8 - 545.6999999999999] um or no sorry uh 255 000 jobs uh

[542.64 - 547.8] leaving 1.86 million instead of the 2.1

[545.7 - 550.38] million because again if you can

[547.8 - 553.68] automate if you can automate away a

[550.38 - 555.42] third or you know a quarter or a half of

[553.68 - 558.06] a job that reduces the demand for people

[555.42 - 559.74] doing that and if you have tools that

[558.06 - 562.56] can accelerate it and make it easier

[559.74 - 564.6] then you uh then of course you have less

[562.56 - 565.92] demand for someone in that role now that

[564.6 - 568.019] being said this vulnerability score

[565.92 - 570.24] means that in general you still want to

[568.019 - 572.4590000000001] have a human there even if you have less

[570.24 - 573.779] demand for humans overall aggregate

[572.459 - 575.279] demand so think of it in terms of

[573.779 - 580.5] aggregates

[575.279 - 583.2] okay so uh that is how I achieved that

[580.5 - 584.64] and um let's see I kind of lost my train

[583.2 - 586.2] of thought okay I guess we can go over

[584.64 - 588.18] the code it's all pretty straightforward

[586.2 - 590.519] I've got it documented

[588.18 - 592.62] um it it dumps it all out into the yaml

[590.519 - 594.92] files here so you can look at all

[592.62 - 597.3] however many there are

[594.92 - 599.16] 116 so you can look at the reasoning

[597.3 - 600.7199999999999] that it used for each one and you can

[599.16 - 603.0] you can monkey around with this if you

[600.72 - 606.0600000000001] want uh you can rerun it all the code is

[603.0 - 610.8] there to regenerate this data but then I

[606.06 - 612.06] got it all into this and so this is uh

[610.8 - 615.66] the total data and I've got it color

[612.06 - 618.2399999999999] coded so I have total number of jobs

[615.66 - 620.399] lost and this is color coded so that the

[618.24 - 622.98] the higher the number the darker or the

[620.399 - 624.6] more red it is and of course it's not

[622.98 - 628.019] proportionate so I added a percentage

[624.6 - 629.82] lost and so this is this column here the

[628.019 - 632.94] jobs lost in percentage loss this is

[629.82 - 637.08] most likely based on some really rough

[632.94 - 638.94] numbers uh based on what AI what I know

[637.08 - 641.58] AI is capable of today and so remember

[638.94 - 643.6800000000001] here's my credibility I was an I.T

[641.58 - 646.0790000000001] automation engineer I've deployed

[643.68 - 649.079] servers and software and cloud and

[646.079 - 651.66] everything to automate uh and and

[649.079 - 653.04] support businesses and and I've

[651.66 - 655.079] integrated all these systems I know what

[653.04 - 657.779] it takes to run these systems and to do

[655.079 - 660.12] the job of like a DBA and business

[657.779 - 662.519] analyst and you know Financial you know

[660.12 - 665.04] comptroller I I talked to everyone when

[662.519 - 667.32] I was in a corporate job so

[665.04 - 668.8199999999999] that being said remember like I'm

[667.32 - 672.779] basically throwing wet spaghetti at the

[668.82 - 675.0] wall so this is a educated guess uh as

[672.779 - 677.04] to percentage of jobs that could be

[675.0 - 679.2] automated away obviously I'm less

[677.04 - 681.18] familiar with uh blue collar jobs with

[679.2 - 683.7] manual labor jobs I have done them in

[681.18 - 685.8599999999999] the past uh I've I've worked nights in

[683.7 - 688.38] in stores and warehouses so I kind of

[685.86 - 689.94] have a feel for that that being said

[688.38 - 693.0] um you know I have poured concrete but

[689.94 - 694.98] not professionally so you know take some

[693.0 - 696.72] of that with a grain of salt now percent

[694.98 - 698.279] loss you see some of the higher ones

[696.72 - 700.5600000000001] computer and mathematical operations

[698.279 - 702.24] okay yeah that makes sense

[700.56 - 703.7399999999999] um stuff with a low percentage loss

[702.24 - 706.44] occupational therapy and physical

[703.74 - 709.92] therapists assistance and AIDS this is

[706.44 - 713.82] at a very very very low risk of being

[709.92 - 717.42] automated away because it is one it's a

[713.82 - 720.0600000000001] highly dexterous job and you also very

[717.42 - 722.959] much want a human I've dated a physical

[720.06 - 725.3389999999999] therapist before and it is an intensely

[722.959 - 727.8] emotional job and it has to do with

[725.339 - 730.8000000000001] communication verbal and non-verbal

[727.8 - 732.779] communication there's tremendous amount

[730.8 - 735.12] of human connection involved in that so

[732.779 - 737.82] I totally agree with the result here

[735.12 - 740.1] where you know health support and stuff

[737.82 - 742.6800000000001] so all these numbers are jobs that are

[740.1 - 745.38] at very very low vulnerability

[742.68 - 746.9399999999999] uh for being automated away

[745.38 - 750.18] um and then you see oh wait here's a big

[746.94 - 753.0600000000001] chunk here so Communications uh clerks

[750.18 - 755.88] information uh handling material

[753.06 - 758.9399999999999] recording secretaries uh other office

[755.88 - 760.5] and admin all at high very high risk of

[758.94 - 762.24] getting automated away because again

[760.5 - 763.579] these are things that you primarily do

[762.24 - 766.74] in front of a computer

[763.579 - 768.5999999999999] agricultural workers this is uh you know

[766.74 - 770.7] eight and a half percent because again

[768.6 - 773.519] you know some of it will be automated

[770.7 - 776.7] away and you see most of them are around

[773.519 - 778.8] kind of like the 10 to 12 percent range

[776.7 - 781.26] um you know with a few few categories

[778.8 - 782.459] being much much more vulnerable to

[781.26 - 786.54] automation

[782.459 - 788.16] now that being said there is uh I have a

[786.54 - 789.899] second sheet and in the second sheet

[788.16 - 791.639] what I did was I removed all the major

[789.899 - 793.88] categories

[791.639 - 796.82] um so you see like it's

[793.88 - 799.74] 11-10011-2000 so I removed

[796.82 - 803.639] 11-000 so that we would have a finer

[799.74 - 806.5790000000001] grain view to look at the total data for

[803.639 - 808.8] each of the the the minor categories

[806.579 - 810.7199999999999] and so here

[808.8 - 812.2199999999999] um it's it's the same same pattern

[810.72 - 813.779] obviously I just removed some of the

[812.22 - 815.279] stuff so that we'd have more accurate in

[813.779 - 818.88] terms of total numbers

[815.279 - 820.98] now what I did was I uh you know I

[818.88 - 823.32] estimated total jobs lost that could be

[820.98 - 826.019] automated away right now so that's right

[823.32 - 828.6] here uh so that's that's how I arrived

[826.019 - 831.12] at that data is okay based on all these

[828.6 - 833.399] vulnerabilities scores and stuff what is

[831.12 - 835.68] the what is the maximum jobs loss that

[833.399 - 837.899] we could anticipate here

[835.68 - 840.4799999999999] uh and then of course you just take that

[837.899 - 841.56] away from you know total remaining etc

[840.48 - 845.76] etc

[841.56 - 847.7399999999999] simple simple arithmetic now over here I

[845.76 - 850.2] said okay let's ignore what Ai and

[847.74 - 853.74] Robotics are capable of today and let's

[850.2 - 856.62] just look at the uh the aggregate demand

[853.74 - 858.54] for humans in a particular job and so

[856.62 - 861.3] for instance in computer occupations

[858.54 - 863.16] there's not really a strong need to have

[861.3 - 865.8] humans doing that to do most of those

[863.16 - 869.16] jobs uh you know if the computer works

[865.8 - 871.5] nobody cares uh as as an example and as

[869.16 - 875.04] a former I.T specialist I can tell you

[871.5 - 876.899] that my Humanity didn't really matter uh

[875.04 - 878.76] it was as long as as long as the lights

[876.899 - 880.86] were on and the you know the registers

[878.76 - 883.98] were running nobody cares

[880.86 - 885.72] uh drafters engineering techs a little

[883.98 - 887.279] bit less demand

[885.72 - 889.86] um let's see

[887.279 - 892.4399999999999] there's some yeah so what are these

[889.86 - 894.779] uh Communications operation operators

[892.44 - 896.6990000000001] clerks these are at super high risk

[894.779 - 898.079] agricultural workers so this is this is

[896.699 - 901.139] one of the ones that's kind of a paradox

[898.079 - 904.7399999999999] because on the one hand right now it's

[901.139 - 907.6800000000001] at a very low risk because it requires a

[904.74 - 909.48] tremendous amount of dexterity but

[907.68 - 911.459] as long as the food gets on the table it

[909.48 - 913.62] doesn't matter who put it there so in

[911.459 - 915.899] terms of intrinsic vulnerability it is a

[913.62 - 916.8] very high intrinsic vulnerability so

[915.899 - 918.899] that's why I've got all these color

[916.8 - 921.899] coded here

[918.899 - 924.0] um let's see uh yep so there that's that

[921.899 - 925.74] and so what I used there was to say like

[924.0 - 928.92] what is the maximum possible attrition

[925.74 - 930.9590000000001] we could see based on you know okay if

[928.92 - 932.2199999999999] we can get rid of 20 of Executives

[930.959 - 934.7399999999999] that's so that's basically what this

[932.22 - 937.74] means is that the aggregate demand for

[934.74 - 940.32] uh Executives for top Executives goes

[937.74 - 943.019] down by 20 because we can automate away

[940.32 - 945.24] a lot of it and you know make the things

[943.019 - 947.1] easier and faster and so on and so forth

[945.24 - 949.62] so that means we could have an attrition

[947.1 - 952.639] of seven hundred thousand Executives

[949.62 - 955.5600000000001] leaving us with 2.9 Million Executives

[952.639 - 956.88] uh and you know but then you go down and

[955.56 - 958.26] because this is Imagining the future

[956.88 - 960.12] where it's like okay

[958.26 - 963.54] let's take the Farm Workers the

[960.12 - 967.199] agricultural workers uh for example and

[963.54 - 970.62] so right now we have uh looks like we've

[967.199 - 973.3199999999999] got a total employment of 390 000.

[970.62 - 976.26] um but there's only so much demand for

[973.32 - 979.6800000000001] that so imagine we put AI in every John

[976.26 - 982.4399999999999] Deere tractor every combine every Hopper

[979.68 - 984.7199999999999] system and you basically have you know

[982.44 - 986.94] Farm entire Farms with no humans that's

[984.72 - 990.24] what this .85 means so we'd have an

[986.94 - 993.9590000000001] attrition rate of 85 percent leaving

[990.24 - 995.5790000000001] only 58 000 farmers in America total now

[993.959 - 998.899] of course this does not include seasonal

[995.579 - 1001.279] labor so that's uh slightly different

[998.899 - 1003.259] construction workers this is another

[1001.279 - 1005.06] example where

[1003.259 - 1007.16] um the it's kind of it's kind of a mixed

[1005.06 - 1009.38] bag so the attrition rate here would be

[1007.16 - 1011.3] expected to be about 40 percent but then

[1009.38 - 1013.639] again like this is a super highly

[1011.3 - 1016.9399999999999] dexterous thing with with that is

[1013.639 - 1018.6800000000001] primarily uh collaborative work so this

[1016.94 - 1020.1800000000001] is going to be a very very very

[1018.68 - 1022.9399999999999] difficult one to automate away because

[1020.18 - 1024.74] it's very high risks if a robot makes a

[1022.94 - 1026.839] mistake an I-beam gets dropped on

[1024.74 - 1028.16] someone and they get killed right and so

[1026.839 - 1031.28] it actually you'll probably have a

[1028.16 - 1033.26] threshold where it'll be safer and

[1031.28 - 1036.9189999999999] cheaper to just take humans off the job

[1033.26 - 1038.72] site entirely now that being said we are

[1036.919 - 1042.0200000000002] already seeing that a little bit with

[1038.72 - 1043.88] like the 3D printing home printers where

[1042.02 - 1045.439] it's like a robotic Gantry that just

[1043.88 - 1047.0] sits over there it's got its pile of

[1045.439 - 1049.4] material and it just builds the house

[1047.0 - 1051.02] with no humans involved at all and so

[1049.4 - 1053.1200000000001] that's what we have to look out for is

[1051.02 - 1054.799] that in some of these cases there's

[1053.12 - 1056.4799999999998] going to be this saltatory leap where it

[1054.799 - 1058.94] goes from you know four and a half

[1056.48 - 1060.799] million employees to zero very quickly

[1058.94 - 1062.299] because as these new technologies rolled

[1060.799 - 1064.34] out you're going to replace them all

[1062.299 - 1065.48] wholesale there is some things are not

[1064.34 - 1067.82] going to lend themselves to being

[1065.48 - 1069.5] gradualistically replaced truckers are

[1067.82 - 1071.96] going to be the same thing once we

[1069.5 - 1073.64] figure out how to automate trucks truck

[1071.96 - 1075.8600000000001] driving it's just not going to make

[1073.64 - 1077.9] sense to have truck drivers now that

[1075.86 - 1079.82] being said that's a very high threshold

[1077.9 - 1081.44] but once to reach that threshold it's a

[1079.82 - 1083.36] step change so that's what I mean by

[1081.44 - 1085.4] saltatory leaps that's that's a step

[1083.36 - 1087.02] change it's a more common term versus

[1085.4 - 1088.6000000000001] gradualistic where you kind of replace

[1087.02 - 1090.98] people slowly

[1088.6 - 1092.8999999999999] in some cases where you replace people

[1090.98 - 1093.919] slowly that could be like I.T staff

[1092.9 - 1096.5590000000002] right

[1093.919 - 1098.179] as a former automation engineer I can

[1096.559 - 1101.0] tell you that I have personally reduced

[1098.179 - 1103.3400000000001] head count in infrastructure departments

[1101.0 - 1105.919] by automating away jobs which reduce the

[1103.34 - 1107.4189999999999] demand but it was over time right it was

[1105.919 - 1109.22] like okay well we can do more with less

[1107.419 - 1110.8400000000001] let me automate a little bit more and

[1109.22 - 1112.22] then we can do more with less and so on

[1110.84 - 1114.02] and so forth and then eventually it was

[1112.22 - 1115.7] basically just me running the whole

[1114.02 - 1118.1] department by myself as an automation

[1115.7 - 1120.5] engineer not everything lends itself to

[1118.1 - 1122.24] that but that being said the amount of

[1120.5 - 1125.0] logic that goes into making decisions

[1122.24 - 1127.1] even financial decisions or executive

[1125.0 - 1129.1] decisions or HR decisions a lot of this

[1127.1 - 1133.6399999999999] is now within the realm of possibility

[1129.1 - 1136.1] of GPT Technologies so when I say that

[1133.64 - 1138.8600000000001] we could we could get rid of almost 25

[1136.1 - 1141.3799999999999] million jobs right now

[1138.86 - 1143.299] that's a number that I will stand behind

[1141.38 - 1145.7] again it's going to take time because

[1143.299 - 1148.58] there's inertia but then in terms of

[1145.7 - 1151.7] total risk of jobs that might go away

[1148.58 - 1154.28] for good looking at 77 million jobs in

[1151.7 - 1156.14] America leaving us with only 70 million

[1154.28 - 1158.78] jobs and we have a population of what

[1156.14 - 1160.46] 350 million or 400 million right now so

[1158.78 - 1162.32] that's an employment rate that is very

[1160.46 - 1165.679] very low that's a very high unemployment

[1162.32 - 1168.2] rate if if that comes to pass and again

[1165.679 - 1170.179] some of these things are dependent upon

[1168.2 - 1172.5800000000002] robotic advancements that are actively

[1170.179 - 1175.039] being worked on construction robots

[1172.58 - 1178.34] surgical robots general purpose domestic

[1175.039 - 1181.039] robots so that the aggregate demand for

[1178.34 - 1184.1] human labor is going to fall off a

[1181.039 - 1187.82] freaking Cliff that being said like okay

[1184.1 - 1190.52] you know what happens with when you have

[1187.82 - 1192.98] 70 million people which is less than a

[1190.52 - 1194.9] third of uh the Americans out there

[1192.98 - 1196.7] let's see what is it

[1194.9 - 1198.4] um I don't remember the population but

[1196.7 - 1202.3400000000001] let's say we have 380

[1198.4 - 1205.64] million Americans right now and

[1202.34 - 1209.1999999999998] we end up with only 70 million jobs

[1205.64 - 1209.2] um oh wait uh

[1209.6 - 1215.84] where's the invert there we go so that

[1212.0 - 1217.82] is a that is only 18 of our current

[1215.84 - 1221.48] employment so that means we'd be having

[1217.82 - 1225.559] an unemployment rate of about 82 percent

[1221.48 - 1228.679] um yeah so we go if if we end up with an

[1225.559 - 1230.84] unemployment rate of 82 percent uh that

[1228.679 - 1232.64] is not good uh based on current

[1230.84 - 1234.62] paradigms and so when people say oh well

[1232.64 - 1235.88] you know Dave you keep advocating for

[1234.62 - 1238.52] Universal basic income and that's

[1235.88 - 1240.3200000000002] socialism well if one out of if only one

[1238.52 - 1243.2] out of five people have a job

[1240.32 - 1244.82] we got to do something right if there

[1243.2 - 1246.44] it's that simple

[1244.82 - 1248.1789999999999] um now one thing that I wanted to point

[1246.44 - 1249.44] out is that people are like well where's

[1248.179 - 1251.96] the money going to come from where does

[1249.44 - 1254.3600000000001] money already come from money is created

[1251.96 - 1256.76] through uh through minting money and

[1254.36 - 1258.4399999999998] giving loans to central banks and who do

[1256.76 - 1259.7] the central banks give money to they

[1258.44 - 1261.799] lend it out to other Banks and

[1259.7 - 1263.48] corporations that's where money comes

[1261.799 - 1265.94] down from it doesn't come from the

[1263.48 - 1267.74] bottom up money is created at the center

[1265.94 - 1270.559] of the economic system and then it

[1267.74 - 1272.9] percolates outwards so when I when I

[1270.559 - 1275.299] mention in another video recently that

[1272.9 - 1276.8600000000001] uh B2B transactions are going to be what

[1275.299 - 1280.28] drives the economy that's what I'm

[1276.86 - 1282.1999999999998] referring to uh because you know if a

[1280.28 - 1284.72] company lends money to another company

[1282.2 - 1287.059] or bank or whatever and then they have

[1284.72 - 1289.039] goods and products and services the

[1287.059 - 1291.74] aggregate consumer demand is only part

[1289.039 - 1293.179] of that uh part of that equation uh

[1291.74 - 1294.32] because if if you have a lights out

[1293.179 - 1295.88] company that's selling goods and

[1294.32 - 1298.28] services to another lights out company

[1295.88 - 1300.919] the economy is going to be red hot even

[1298.28 - 1303.58] though there's no humans involved so

[1300.919 - 1305.72] that's why I mentioned in my in my uh

[1303.58 - 1307.6999999999998] macroeconomics or sorry post labor

[1305.72 - 1308.96] economics video that we're going to need

[1307.7 - 1310.4] new kpi

[1308.96 - 1313.039] and we're also going to need to

[1310.4 - 1314.539] redistribute that because right now the

[1313.039 - 1317.6589999999999] only way that money gets into the hands

[1314.539 - 1320.0] of consumers is through either the the

[1317.659 - 1323.5390000000002] very few uh entitlement programs that we

[1320.0 - 1325.94] do have uh which are relatively weak or

[1323.539 - 1329.24] through uh employment through money

[1325.94 - 1330.919] coming by force of extraction downwards

[1329.24 - 1333.74] uh through the through the grapevine

[1330.919 - 1335.7800000000002] from the central banks to the regional

[1333.74 - 1338.78] Banks to the corporations and then

[1335.78 - 1341.24] finally to us but if we if we reverse

[1338.78 - 1343.8799999999999] that if instead so this is basically

[1341.24 - 1347.48] what Universal basic income is to me if

[1343.88 - 1349.5200000000002] instead of lending money to from uh from

[1347.48 - 1351.74] you know the Federal Reserve to the

[1349.52 - 1354.44] central banks to the regional Banks what

[1351.74 - 1356.6] if we instead uh take about half of that

[1354.44 - 1358.52] and just give it instead of lending it

[1356.6 - 1360.1399999999999] out to Banks we just give it to
