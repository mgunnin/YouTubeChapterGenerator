[0.799 - 4.4] hey everybody david shapiro here with uh

[3.28 - 6.48] part two

[4.4 - 9.519] of my getting started with python and

[6.48 - 11.36] gpt3 from scratch video series

[9.519 - 13.519] uh before we get started please go ahead

[11.36 - 15.36] and like and subscribe this video uh

[13.519 - 17.84] that will help me work towards getting

[15.36 - 19.198999999999998] monetized on youtube which who knows

[17.84 - 22.8] maybe one day i'll be able to do this

[19.199 - 24.8] full time but also if you like uh my

[22.8 - 26.64] videos my content you find them helpful

[24.8 - 28.16] please consider hopping over to my

[26.64 - 29.679000000000002] patreon link in the description or

[28.16 - 32.88] comments

[29.679 - 35.519999999999996] and consider supporting me directly

[32.88 - 37.6] that will go much further towards

[35.52 - 40.239000000000004] helping me to do this full-time

[37.6 - 42.079] you see how i churn out content

[40.239 - 44.48] i'm happy to keep doing this and the

[42.079 - 46.64] more support i get the better it'll be

[44.48 - 50.16] so without further ado let's jump back

[46.64 - 52.16] over to our uh our project our learning

[50.16 - 54.239] so this is our repo

[52.16 - 57.599999999999994] this is where we left off we did a hello

[54.239 - 59.519999999999996] world um a read me and

[57.6 - 60.480000000000004] and so on and so forth now what i've

[59.52 - 62.800000000000004] done

[60.48 - 64.72] is i added a

[62.8 - 66.56] i added git ignore

[64.72 - 69.67999999999999] and what git ignore does

[66.56 - 71.119] is i've added open ai api key because

[69.68 - 74.56] last time i said

[71.119 - 76.08] whatever you do don't ever store your

[74.56 - 78.799] api key

[76.08 - 80.24] publicly or in a git repo and so what

[78.799 - 81.60000000000001] git ignore does and this is what it

[80.24 - 85.19999999999999] looks like locally

[81.6 - 87.119] is it tells git to ignore that

[85.2 - 89.28] um you can do directories you can do

[87.119 - 92.159] wild cards as well so you could do like

[89.28 - 95.6] star.json to ignore all json files

[92.159 - 98.4] that's fine so but if i look in my repo

[95.6 - 100.15899999999999] my key is here so you should have last

[98.4 - 101.43900000000001] time you should have created this text

[100.159 - 103.84] file

[101.439 - 104.96] and populated it

[103.84 - 107.04] and

[104.96 - 108.399] get in and get your hello world to work

[107.04 - 109.84] so let's take a quick look at hello

[108.399 - 112.72] world

[109.84 - 114.96000000000001] um all this does is opens a file sets

[112.72 - 117.03999999999999] the api or at first we declare a

[114.96 - 118.32] function that opens the file reads it

[117.04 - 121.36000000000001] and returns

[118.32 - 123.119] um that file contents and then we have a

[121.36 - 124.399] function that will do a davinci

[123.119 - 126.88] completion

[124.399 - 129.119] um and then we will

[126.88 - 130.56] we'll we get we pass it a prompt that

[129.119 - 133.2] says write a list of famous american

[130.56 - 135.12] actors we get the response from gpd3 and

[133.2 - 137.28] then we print it out so i'm assuming you

[135.12 - 138.8] did your homework and you you've tested

[137.28 - 140.48] this so python

[138.8 - 142.08] hello world

[140.48 - 143.67999999999998] so it'll take just a second and then

[142.08 - 145.52] it'll spit out

[143.68 - 148.56] tom hanks leonardo dicaprio jennifer

[145.52 - 149.44] lawrence brad pitt excellent so it works

[148.56 - 151.68] now

[149.44 - 152.8] this was all statically coded so what

[151.68 - 154.4] are we going to do we need to do

[152.8 - 156.16000000000003] something more useful

[154.4 - 158.87900000000002] so what we're going to do is we're going

[156.16 - 160.72] to hop over to the playground and we're

[158.879 - 162.879] going to do some prompt engineering

[160.72 - 164.64] so let's just say we want to do our

[162.879 - 167.35999999999999] first chatbot

[164.64 - 169.11999999999998] um so we'll say the following is a

[167.36 - 171.28] conversation

[169.12 - 173.12] between user

[171.28 - 176.08] and jacks

[173.12 - 177.92000000000002] jax is a sentient

[176.08 - 179.519] sentient

[177.92 - 181.28] machine

[179.519 - 182.72] with the goal

[181.28 - 184.08] of

[182.72 - 186.8] i don't want to say something evil like

[184.08 - 190.31900000000002] taking over the world let's say jax is a

[186.8 - 192.56] sentient machine with the goal of um

[190.319 - 195.28] i don't know world peace

[192.56 - 197.68] that's fine um okay

[195.28 - 201.84] so let's say user

[197.68 - 203.12] hey jax uh what are you doing today

[201.84 - 205.84] and then let's see what happens if we

[203.12 - 205.84] just hit enter

[206.56 - 210.64000000000001] that says jacks i'm working on my plans

[208.319 - 212.159] for world peace not bad

[210.64 - 215.27999999999997] so what's the first thing that you

[212.159 - 217.2] notice um there's a space here uh that's

[215.28 - 219.519] not necessarily a bad thing but we'll we

[217.2 - 220.56] will have to contend with that space

[219.519 - 221.92000000000002] um

[220.56 - 224.879] if we uh

[221.92 - 226.64] when we go to automate this in code

[224.879 - 228.56] that's like okay

[226.64 - 232.55999999999997] user okay

[228.56 - 234.48] how are you going to achieve that

[232.56 - 235.84] and we say what's next

[234.48 - 238.64] i'm still working out the details but

[235.84 - 241.04] i'm confident i can make a difference

[238.64 - 243.439] user

[241.04 - 246.48] so you're not that smart are you

[243.439 - 247.68] i'm being real sassy here

[246.48 - 250.0] oh okay

[247.68 - 251.92000000000002] all right so you can see that this works

[250.0 - 254.64] so now what do we do how do we actually

[251.92 - 256.639] take this into um

[254.64 - 258.239] and and do this with code

[256.639 - 261.759] so let me show you

[258.239 - 264.08] so the first thing we do is we copy down

[261.759 - 265.04] this prompt this initial prompt and you

[264.08 - 268.96] see how

[265.04 - 270.72] how how um how simple it is uh so what

[268.96 - 272.63899999999995] we'll do is we'll copy that

[270.72 - 273.759] we'll say we'll save this into a new

[272.639 - 275.84000000000003] file

[273.759 - 277.44] do a couple new lines and then we'll do

[275.84 - 279.28] block and i'll show you what we do with

[277.44 - 281.36] the block in just a minute

[279.28 - 282.479] so we'll save this as prompt

[281.36 - 285.04] chat

[282.479 - 287.36] so now we have this which is just a copy

[285.04 - 289.6] paste of what we did in the playground

[287.36 - 290.88] and it's like okay well how do we

[289.6 - 293.28000000000003] accumulate

[290.88 - 295.199] these this chat how do we what do we do

[293.28 - 297.19899999999996] here

[295.199 - 298.639] i'm glad you asked so we'll get we'll

[297.199 - 302.24] start a new file

[298.639 - 304.24] and then we'll do file f uh alt f a for

[302.24 - 307.28000000000003] alt uh file save as

[304.24 - 308.96000000000004] and we'll go to all types

[307.28 - 311.919] and we'll say um

[308.96 - 313.84] chat dot pi so now we've got a new

[311.919 - 314.88] um we've got a new uh

[313.84 - 317.11999999999995] uh

[314.88 - 318.8] python script that we're working on

[317.12 - 321.199] this will be in the repo so you will

[318.8 - 323.039] have been able to just clone this down

[321.199 - 324.8] but what i recommend that you do

[323.039 - 326.56] is that you ignore the existing file you

[324.8 - 329.12] can look at it for reference but that

[326.56 - 330.24] you follow along and do this coding

[329.12 - 331.68] by hand

[330.24 - 334.08] so first what we'll do is we'll just

[331.68 - 335.039] copy the existing code that we have that

[334.08 - 337.59999999999997] works

[335.039 - 339.12] there is no shame in recycling

[337.6 - 341.199] your old code

[339.12 - 342.8] just remember that if you have errors in

[341.199 - 345.039] your old code you're copying those

[342.8 - 347.199] errors i do that all the time

[345.039 - 348.639] um okay so we start here we've got our

[347.199 - 350.56] completion

[348.639 - 352.40000000000003] it uses davinci

[350.56 - 353.919] and we say prompt write a list of famous

[352.4 - 355.67999999999995] american actors

[353.919 - 357.28] all right so here's your first big

[355.68 - 359.84000000000003] python lesson

[357.28 - 362.31899999999996] we want to have an open-ended chat so

[359.84 - 364.31899999999996] there's a few things that we need to do

[362.319 - 365.26] first we get rid of the prompt not using

[364.319 - 366.40000000000003] that

[365.26 - 370.0] [Music]

[366.4 - 371.84] so we'll say while true oops

[370.0 - 373.68] so while true this is what's called a

[371.84 - 375.919] this is what's called a loop there's a

[373.68 - 378.40000000000003] few kinds of loops the two primary loops

[375.919 - 380.79999999999995] that you'll use are a while loop

[378.4 - 383.19899999999996] and so if you do while true it's just

[380.8 - 384.88] always true so this is an infinite loop

[383.199 - 386.40000000000003] so while true

[384.88 - 389.36] what are we going to do

[386.4 - 393.28] uh well first we need user input

[389.36 - 395.68] and we'll say user input equals input

[393.28 - 397.67999999999995] and we'll just say user

[395.68 - 400.08] oops user

[397.68 - 403.6] and it's that simple so this

[400.08 - 405.84] is a built-in um uh construct a built-in

[403.6 - 408.08000000000004] function for python that allows you to

[405.84 - 410.15999999999997] just take in console user

[408.08 - 412.96] console input from the user

[410.16 - 414.40000000000003] great okay now what ah well we forgot a

[412.96 - 417.52] step what do we where do we put this do

[414.4 - 418.63899999999995] we just pass this um do we just do gpt3

[417.52 - 419.919] completion

[418.639 - 421.52] user input

[419.919 - 422.4] what do you think is going to happen

[421.52 - 424.79999999999995] nothing

[422.4 - 425.919] because let's say that you see something

[424.8 - 428.24] that says like

[425.919 - 429.84] that you get this variable

[428.24 - 432.0] here let me just show you actually

[429.84 - 435.11999999999995] python um

[432.0 - 437.199] uh user input equals

[435.12 - 439.599] input

[437.199 - 439.599] user

[439.84 - 444.79999999999995] it says user um

[442.319 - 447.599] hey jax are you alive

[444.8 - 449.12] okay now what so then we say print

[447.599 - 451.599] user input

[449.12 - 455.199] hey jax are you live so if we just print

[451.599 - 458.479] this or if we just send this up to gpt 3

[455.199 - 458.479] it's not going to do anything for us

[461.12 - 465.44] it kind of intuits that uh that it's a

[463.039 - 467.199] machine or whatever but there's no other

[465.44 - 468.8] framing right

[467.199 - 471.68] so it it

[468.8 - 472.72] if we however

[471.68 - 474.08] um

[472.72 - 477.03900000000004] go back to our

[474.08 - 477.039] uh prompt

[477.36 - 480.879] right here

[479.12 - 482.479] we say

[480.879 - 483.91900000000004] user

[482.479 - 487.12] hey jax

[483.919 - 487.12] are you alive

[488.0 - 491.36] of course i am i'm a sentient machine

[489.599 - 493.28] with a goal of world peace see a little

[491.36 - 494.47900000000004] bit different all right so how do we do

[493.28 - 496.0] this

[494.479 - 498.24] glad you asked

[496.0 - 499.28] so we say so we're going to say no

[498.24 - 502.08] that's not what we're going to do we're

[499.28 - 503.039] not going to just send up our base

[502.08 - 505.199] input

[503.039 - 507.52] we're going to say conversation equals

[505.199 - 509.36] list so what you can do is this is

[507.52 - 512.159] called instantiating a variable or

[509.36 - 514.479] declaring a variable so now conversation

[512.159 - 516.8] we're saying conversation is an empty

[514.479 - 518.64] list so we're going to accumulate it as

[516.8 - 521.039] a list of

[518.64 - 523.36] as a list of text and what this does is

[521.039 - 524.24] this instantiates another variable a

[523.36 - 528.0] text

[524.24 - 529.36] variable or a string variable as um as

[528.0 - 532.16] an input

[529.36 - 534.88] okay great so then what do we do with it

[532.16 - 536.48] well how do you add something to a list

[534.88 - 538.56] so first you do

[536.48 - 539.76] conversation dot

[538.56 - 542.64] append

[539.76 - 544.56] and then we don't want just

[542.64 - 546.88] we don't want just this

[544.56 - 550.399] we want this to look so hey jacks are

[546.88 - 552.48] you alive but if you look here i had

[550.399 - 554.64] this little bit so it tells you who was

[552.48 - 556.32] speaking right you see that in every

[554.64 - 557.519] text message every chat you got to know

[556.32 - 560.08] who's speaking

[557.519 - 563.04] so we want to have both the user and hey

[560.08 - 564.32] jax are you live so what we do here

[563.04 - 566.56] is we do

[564.32 - 568.1600000000001] um we'll copy

[566.56 - 569.68] this bit so that'll be that'll be

[568.16 - 571.519] hard-coded

[569.68 - 572.56] and then we'll do percent

[571.519 - 574.399] s

[572.56 - 575.279] and so basically that's a placeholder

[574.399 - 577.76] for

[575.279 - 579.4399999999999] populating a string so percent s means

[577.76 - 581.4399999999999] populate a string here

[579.44 - 584.0] and then we're going to do percent

[581.44 - 586.48] user input and so this says all right

[584.0 - 589.6] when you when you store this variable

[586.48 - 592.24] populate this bit with this variable

[589.6 - 596.0] and so then what happens is

[592.24 - 598.16] uh in memory it'll look just like this

[596.0 - 599.2] great okay now what

[598.16 - 601.36] um

[599.2 - 603.44] how do we convert

[601.36 - 605.6800000000001] uh how do we convert this conversation

[603.44 - 607.6800000000001] into something usable

[605.68 - 608.959] so that we can actually send it up to

[607.68 - 611.5999999999999] gpt3

[608.959 - 614.88] so let me let me go ahead and just um

[611.6 - 616.5600000000001] i'll i'll follow along here in in the

[614.88 - 618.56] python interpreter here this is a little

[616.56 - 621.1199999999999] big

[618.56 - 621.1199999999999] so we'll say

[622.32 - 626.88] okay so

[623.839 - 628.9590000000001] conversation equals list okay cool you

[626.88 - 630.56] can do you can follow along in your own

[628.959 - 633.3599999999999] interpreter

[630.56 - 634.7199999999999] and we'll say uh conversation

[633.36 - 636.64] dot

[634.72 - 638.72] append

[636.64 - 641.1999999999999] user um

[638.72 - 642.32] hey jax are you alive

[641.2 - 643.76] okay

[642.32 - 645.519] so that's what it'll look like and then

[643.76 - 647.36] we do print

[645.519 - 649.12] conversation

[647.36 - 651.36] and you see how it's it's wrapped in

[649.12 - 653.279] brackets that's how you know that it's a

[651.36 - 655.36] list

[653.279 - 657.4399999999999] okay so then then what let's imagine

[655.36 - 658.88] that jax gave us a response actually we

[657.44 - 662.24] can just go ahead and copy jax's

[658.88 - 663.36] response so we're basically simulating

[662.24 - 666.5600000000001] what's going to be happening in the

[663.36 - 668.24] background so then we'll do conversation

[666.56 - 670.64] dot append

[668.24 - 672.0790000000001] and then add the uh

[670.64 - 674.399] the single quote

[672.079 - 676.959] and do shift insert so the reason that i

[674.399 - 679.76] do shift insert instead of control v

[676.959 - 681.279] is that sometimes your terminal session

[679.76 - 682.88] doesn't really like

[681.279 - 685.24] control v

[682.88 - 688.399] and shift insert is just a little more

[685.24 - 691.44] reliable um

[688.399 - 691.44] so of course i am

[691.6 - 696.399] okay so now if we do print conversation

[694.32 - 698.9590000000001] you see that user hey jacks or your live

[696.399 - 701.12] jacks of course i am one advantage of a

[698.959 - 703.5999999999999] list is that it is always in the order

[701.12 - 704.5600000000001] that you add it that you create it in

[703.6 - 707.12] and so

[704.56 - 710.0] um lists are uh what is that it's not

[707.12 - 711.36] immutable it may be immutable no

[710.0 - 713.36] i can't remember the exact term right

[711.36 - 715.279] now but anyways lists are always going

[713.36 - 716.639] to be in the order in which you created

[715.279 - 717.68] them

[716.639 - 718.48] okay

[717.68 - 722.2399999999999] so

[718.48 - 724.16] um now what so like conversation so

[722.24 - 726.16] let's say print

[724.16 - 728.399] um conversation and then if we do

[726.16 - 730.639] bracket zero so that's index zero

[728.399 - 732.32] that'll just print the first part

[730.639 - 734.0790000000001] and the second part

[732.32 - 736.24] how do we how do we get this up into

[734.079 - 738.079] gpt3

[736.24 - 740.88] what we need to do is we need to convert

[738.079 - 743.3599999999999] this list into a full text block so that

[740.88 - 744.48] you can see as it gets bigger and gets

[743.36 - 745.839] accumulated

[744.48 - 748.32] we will have

[745.839 - 749.9200000000001] we'll have a

[748.32 - 751.519] something that we can take from a list

[749.92 - 753.5999999999999] we can accumulate the conversation we

[751.519 - 755.36] can save it locally but then we also

[753.6 - 757.76] need to be able to convert it back into

[755.36 - 760.16] text to send it in a gpt3 prompt because

[757.76 - 761.8389999999999] gpt3 doesn't understand python lists it

[760.16 - 763.8389999999999] only understands text

[761.839 - 765.9200000000001] so we do here is we do

[763.839 - 768.72] single single quote

[765.92 - 770.56] slash backslash n so that's for newline

[768.72 - 773.0400000000001] and we do dot join

[770.56 - 774.959] so this is this is a method that is

[773.04 - 776.3199999999999] built into the string type in python

[774.959 - 778.16] that allows you

[776.32 - 780.72] to um it's basically a list

[778.16 - 782.16] comprehension and so we'll do is do uh

[780.72 - 784.9590000000001] conversation

[782.16 - 789.279] um and so we'll do is we'll do uh text

[784.959 - 791.92] equals uh backslash n join conversation

[789.279 - 793.519] so one new line and then we're gonna put

[791.92 - 797.279] a new line between every bit of

[793.519 - 799.36] conversation so then if we do print text

[797.279 - 800.639] it puts it back into one text block

[799.36 - 802.72] great

[800.639 - 804.01] so we'll just copy that code because

[802.72 - 805.44] that's exactly what we need

[804.01 - 807.36] [Music]

[805.44 - 808.72] text and join

[807.36 - 811.44] excuse me

[808.72 - 814.72] okay great so now we've got the text

[811.44 - 816.0] block that we want to put here

[814.72 - 818.32] so basically what it's going to look

[816.0 - 820.399] like when we're done

[818.32 - 822.24] copy that real quick we're going to say

[820.399 - 825.12] it's going to look like this

[822.24 - 827.12] and if we put this into

[825.12 - 830.639] up into gpt3 we can test how it's going

[827.12 - 830.639] to look the user

[831.04 - 836.88] yes but how do you know you're s you're

[834.48 - 836.88] alive

[839.68 - 844.399] there you go okay so you can see this is

[841.92 - 846.3199999999999] this is coming right along

[844.399 - 848.8] but we're still we're still a couple

[846.32 - 851.519] steps shy let's do a control z to undo

[848.8 - 852.959] that so we've got this little token here

[851.519 - 854.9590000000001] and it's like okay well what do we do

[852.959 - 858.2399999999999] next

[854.959 - 861.199] all right so we will use

[858.24 - 862.16] we'll say prompt equals

[861.199 - 864.56] open

[862.16 - 866.3199999999999] file so this open file is the function

[864.56 - 868.6389999999999] that i wrote here

[866.32 - 871.36] and we're going to say open prompt

[868.639 - 873.6] underscore chat.text that's this right

[871.36 - 873.6] here

[873.68 - 878.7199999999999] um and so we just pass it and what this

[875.839 - 881.519] passes back it just passes um it says

[878.72 - 884.8000000000001] return infile read so it'll read the

[881.519 - 886.32] file for us and it'll pass it back as is

[884.8 - 889.12] but what we want to do is we want to

[886.32 - 890.88] replace this block with the text

[889.12 - 893.279] um you know so basically we'll do that

[890.88 - 895.68] we'll we'll do functionally the same

[893.279 - 897.36] that we did just a minute ago whoopsies

[895.68 - 898.959] that's not what i meant to do

[897.36 - 902.0790000000001] there we go

[898.959 - 904.6389999999999] okay so we'll save that um we'll we'll

[902.079 - 907.199] we'll functionally replace that block so

[904.639 - 910.48] it'll look like this right

[907.199 - 912.0] so we'll do a virtual control v to paste

[910.48 - 914.88] in instead of having this this

[912.0 - 919.199] placeholder will actually paste in our

[914.88 - 920.8] our our text block so we do dot replace

[919.199 - 923.519] and then we'll say what are we going to

[920.8 - 925.199] replace we're going to look for block

[923.519 - 926.48] and we're going to replace it

[925.199 - 928.0] with text

[926.48 - 929.6800000000001] and so this

[928.0 - 930.88] variable right here

[929.68 - 932.6389999999999] is this one

[930.88 - 935.519] and so you see how text is used in

[932.639 - 936.32] multiple places that's bad form so what

[935.519 - 939.12] we're going to do is we're going to

[936.32 - 940.88] rename this and and we'll call this

[939.12 - 942.399] text block

[940.88 - 944.24] because that's a little bit more

[942.399 - 946.399] specific about what what it is that it

[944.24 - 948.72] is so this is the conversation this is

[946.399 - 950.0] the text block of the conversation so

[948.72 - 951.12] we'll

[950.0 - 952.8] do that

[951.12 - 954.9590000000001] and this will make

[952.8 - 956.079] the prompt is going to look just like

[954.959 - 958.2399999999999] this

[956.079 - 960.959] now there's one last step missing

[958.24 - 962.24] so uh fortunately

[960.959 - 963.04] da vinci

[962.24 - 965.36] is

[963.04 - 967.36] this this one is aligned well enough so

[965.36 - 969.36] that it knows once it sees a couple of

[967.36 - 972.0790000000001] messages back and forth it knows what

[969.36 - 973.759] format to follow however we don't want

[972.079 - 975.3599999999999] to rely on that

[973.759 - 977.44] so what we're going to do

[975.36 - 978.9590000000001] is we're going to add just a little bit

[977.44 - 981.519] to the end of the prompt so we'll say

[978.959 - 982.56] prompt equals prompt

[981.519 - 984.399] plus

[982.56 - 985.5999999999999] we'll do one more new line

[984.399 - 987.199] jacks

[985.6 - 989.6800000000001] and so basically what that'll make it

[987.199 - 991.12] look like is

[989.68 - 992.56] this

[991.12 - 994.16] so

[992.56 - 996.3199999999999] it we're basically we're basically

[994.16 - 998.399] priming the next line because one thing

[996.32 - 1000.24] that can happen this this is doing

[998.399 - 1002.56] pretty well not to do this but one thing

[1000.24 - 1003.6] that can happen is if you don't have

[1002.56 - 1005.279] this here

[1003.6 - 1008.32] it might like

[1005.279 - 1010.32] continue the user's side

[1008.32 - 1012.5600000000001] see how what it did here is if i took

[1010.32 - 1014.32] out the um the question mark it added in

[1012.56 - 1016.4799999999999] the question mark for me and then

[1014.32 - 1017.9200000000001] continued with jax but let's say you

[1016.48 - 1021.6800000000001] didn't want that

[1017.92 - 1021.68] um and you just say jax

[1022.639 - 1026.079] see it's a little bit different

[1024.48 - 1027.76] so you got to be very careful about the

[1026.079 - 1031.1989999999998] text that you pass back

[1027.76 - 1033.439] okay so we we uh we we load our prompt

[1031.199 - 1036.16] we populate it with the text block of

[1033.439 - 1037.3600000000001] the conversation and we say okay jax

[1036.16 - 1038.559] you're up

[1037.36 - 1040.319] so now what

[1038.559 - 1041.6] now we do

[1040.319 - 1042.72] response

[1041.6 - 1044.24] actually here we've already got that

[1042.72 - 1046.72] code here

[1044.24 - 1048.88] so response equals gpt3 completion

[1046.72 - 1050.4] prompt so this is going to be jax's

[1048.88 - 1052.4] answer

[1050.4 - 1055.2800000000002] and so what we'll do is

[1052.4 - 1055.2800000000002] we will do print

[1056.32 - 1061.52] jacks

[1058.32 - 1063.28] and then we'll do comma response so

[1061.52 - 1065.12] print allows you to print multiple

[1063.28 - 1067.12] variables at once so we're basically

[1065.12 - 1068.8799999999999] printing two string variables and when

[1067.12 - 1071.039] you put a comma between it it basically

[1068.88 - 1072.24] just acts like a space it won't work if

[1071.039 - 1074.8799999999999] you do this because it's like i don't

[1072.24 - 1077.36] know how to how to view these two things

[1074.88 - 1078.8400000000001] so we just do jax comma response

[1077.36 - 1082.3999999999999] great

[1078.84 - 1084.559] so but don't we need to accumulate jax's

[1082.4 - 1087.1200000000001] end of the conversation in the text

[1084.559 - 1089.039] block and the in the list absolutely

[1087.12 - 1091.6789999999999] because if we don't it's just going to

[1089.039 - 1093.2] talk be talking to itself and our it

[1091.679 - 1096.0] will we're only right now we're only

[1093.2 - 1098.0] recording our side of the conversation

[1096.0 - 1101.52] um okay so then what we'll do is we'll

[1098.0 - 1104.08] do conversation dot append

[1101.52 - 1106.32] and we'll make this look exactly like

[1104.08 - 1108.6399999999999] this one

[1106.32 - 1111.4399999999998] except we'll change this to jax

[1108.64 - 1113.1200000000001] and we'll change user input

[1111.44 - 1114.24] to response

[1113.12 - 1115.9189999999999] there you go

[1114.24 - 1119.44] um all right

[1115.919 - 1120.5590000000002] so we're just about done and ready for

[1119.44 - 1121.679] testing

[1120.559 - 1124.0] um

[1121.679 - 1126.5590000000002] one thing that is important to note here

[1124.0 - 1128.559] you see how it added a couple new lines

[1126.559 - 1130.72] so for whatever reason gpt3 will

[1128.559 - 1133.76] sometimes do this where it'll it'll add

[1130.72 - 1135.3600000000001] new lines um between stuff and we don't

[1133.76 - 1137.76] want our our

[1135.36 - 1139.52] our text message to get all scattered we

[1137.76 - 1140.559] want it to look

[1139.52 - 1142.24] like this

[1140.559 - 1144.48] so how do we do that

[1142.24 - 1146.08] um i've got that i've got that covered

[1144.48 - 1148.32] right here with this little function i

[1146.08 - 1149.76] think i mentioned it in the previous

[1148.32 - 1152.799] video

[1149.76 - 1155.84] so it always will cut out any excess

[1152.799 - 1158.0] space around it

[1155.84 - 1159.4399999999998] now there's one last thing

[1158.0 - 1161.919] sometimes

[1159.44 - 1164.799] what happens is

[1161.919 - 1167.3600000000001] is gbt3 will just it'll have the whole

[1164.799 - 1169.44] conversation on its own right

[1167.36 - 1172.4799999999998] um it'll just it'll it'll try and fill

[1169.44 - 1173.919] in the position for the user and jax and

[1172.48 - 1176.88] so we want to do

[1173.919 - 1180.88] is we want it to stop if if gpt3 ever

[1176.88 - 1184.64] generates these tokens user or jacks and

[1180.88 - 1186.3200000000002] so what we do is we'll add those

[1184.64 - 1188.3200000000002] right here

[1186.32 - 1191.48] so jacks

[1188.32 - 1191.48] and then

[1192.08 - 1194.48] user i could have just typed it out i

[1193.44 - 1196.0800000000002] guess

[1194.48 - 1198.32] that's five characters i should have

[1196.08 - 1201.6] typed it out okay that's fine so this

[1198.32 - 1203.4399999999998] will basically tell gbt3 just in case

[1201.6 - 1204.32] do not have this whole conversation for

[1203.44 - 1206.88] me

[1204.32 - 1209.84] because what i can do is i can say

[1206.88 - 1212.48] um if we change this to imagine

[1209.84 - 1213.9189999999999] a conversation between user and jax

[1212.48 - 1216.08] what'll happen is it'll do the

[1213.919 - 1220.039] conversation for me

[1216.08 - 1220.039] well sometimes it will

[1221.76 - 1225.039] okay

[1223.52 - 1226.6399999999999] this prompt isn't causing it to do that

[1225.039 - 1228.32] but sometimes it will

[1226.64 - 1231.1200000000001] i wonder if it'll do it if we if we turn

[1228.32 - 1231.12] the temperature up

[1232.72 - 1236.799] there we go see how it completed it for

[1235.6 - 1239.12] me

[1236.799 - 1241.039] so sometimes it's like you know it'll

[1239.12 - 1243.1999999999998] kind of make up its own mind about what

[1241.039 - 1244.799] to do so we'll turn that back down to

[1243.2 - 1246.32] 0.7

[1244.799 - 1249.6] um okay

[1246.32 - 1251.12] i think we're ready for testing

[1249.6 - 1254.32] so we'll come here

[1251.12 - 1255.76] um once you're in python you hit control
