[0.539 - 6.2989999999999995] hey everyone David Shapiro here with a

[3.48 - 9.179] weekly update for project Raven but

[6.299 - 9.72] before we jump into that I wanted to

[9.179 - 13.5] um

[9.72 - 15.540000000000001] share this with you guys so Nvidia is a

[13.5 - 18.0] company that I'm working with

[15.54 - 19.858999999999998] public information we had a my startup

[18.0 - 23.22] had a press release that we're in the

[19.859 - 25.8] Nvidia Inception program and I saw this

[23.22 - 27.119] article just now and I said yes we need

[25.8 - 30.3] to talk about this

[27.119 - 32.82] so Nvidia predicts that AI models one

[30.3 - 36.480000000000004] million times more powerful than chat

[32.82 - 40.68] GPT will be here within 10 years

[36.48 - 42.839999999999996] and this is why projects like Raven are

[40.68 - 45.48] so important

[42.84 - 48.0] so the tldr

[45.48 - 51.12] is that as

[48.0 - 53.399] uh neural networks get bigger they get

[51.12 - 56.16] deeper more training data we get better

[53.399 - 59.34] optimizations so on and so forth and as

[56.16 - 61.31999999999999] also the underlying Hardware is getting

[59.34 - 63.359] better really quick

[61.32 - 67.26] so you look at the way that things are

[63.359 - 70.26] scaling up and it just goes keeps going

[67.26 - 73.799] this is why I am confident when I say we

[70.26 - 76.74000000000001] will be facing 70 unemployment by 2030

[73.799 - 80.159] because you think of how useful chat GPT

[76.74 - 83.33999999999999] is right now imagine chat gpt2 three

[80.159 - 86.759] four five six versions later

[83.34 - 89.28] with Hardware that is 10 000 times more

[86.759 - 91.08] powerful on models that are ten thousand

[89.28 - 95.28] times more sophisticated

[91.08 - 97.32] this is coming and it's coming fast so

[95.28 - 98.22] with all that said

[97.32 - 100.79899999999999] thank you

[98.22 - 103.259] let's talk about how to make sure that

[100.799 - 104.93900000000001] once artificial general intelligence and

[103.259 - 106.92] then artificial super intelligence and

[104.939 - 108.96] Global intelligence whatever you want to

[106.92 - 111.18] call it as it's coming

[108.96 - 113.69999999999999] how do we make sure that it's safe

[111.18 - 115.259] how do we make sure that it isn't going

[113.7 - 118.22] to kill us all and that it does what we

[115.259 - 118.22] want etc etc

[118.56 - 124.56] so there's a few components of this

[120.899 - 126.38] problem one is just the software how do

[124.56 - 128.88] you write the code how do you even

[126.38 - 132.18] generalize the principles of

[128.88 - 134.4] intelligence into code into language so

[132.18 - 137.81900000000002] that a machine can do it

[134.4 - 139.98000000000002] so that is that is the first PR uh

[137.819 - 142.14] problem of developing a cognitive

[139.98 - 145.73899999999998] architecture like Raven and so if you're

[142.14 - 147.95899999999997] new Raven is my open source project for

[145.739 - 150.18] creating an artificial cognitive entity

[147.959 - 152.18] or autonomous cognitive entity that's

[150.18 - 155.22] actually what we're pivoting to Ace

[152.18 - 157.86] autonomous cognitive entity is a machine

[155.22 - 161.16] that can think on its own

[157.86 - 162.59900000000002] uh indefinitely and ideally will be safe

[161.16 - 164.42] I've written a few books on this topic

[162.599 - 167.57999999999998] so on and so forth

[164.42 - 170.64] so that is

[167.58 - 174.06] the purpose of this project and with

[170.64 - 176.819] that I have a whole bunch of stuff code

[174.06 - 180.06] experiments books so on and so forth but

[176.819 - 183.66] as you can see we have 541 Stars 58

[180.06 - 185.34] Forks uh 69 Watchers

[183.66 - 189.239] what we are working on with this project

[185.34 - 191.70000000000002] right now we're on consensus Step 2 to

[189.239 - 193.8] define a consensus policy

[191.7 - 196.61999999999998] and so for some background

[193.8 - 200.76000000000002] the idea is that

[196.62 - 202.20000000000002] something as important as AGI artificial

[200.76 - 203.51899999999998] Global intelligence or autonomous

[202.2 - 205.73899999999998] cognitive entities

[203.519 - 208.5] whatever digital super intelligence

[205.739 - 210.48000000000002] something like this is entirely too

[208.5 - 214.14] important for it to be developed

[210.48 - 216.29999999999998] entirely behind closed doors

[214.14 - 219.23899999999998] so one of the chief goals one of the

[216.3 - 220.799] foremost goals of my project is to have

[219.239 - 223.799] the development be completely

[220.799 - 226.62] transparent and as participatory as

[223.799 - 229.739] possible that's what we're working on

[226.62 - 232.62] and so consensus Capital C consensus is

[229.739 - 234.18] a method of inviting more people to the

[232.62 - 236.459] table now

[234.18 - 239.64000000000001] we're learning lessons as we go so for

[236.459 - 241.799] instance not everyone is qualified to uh

[239.64 - 243.89999999999998] contribute but everyone's voice should

[241.799 - 245.87900000000002] be heard and so we're working on the

[243.9 - 247.44] nuances of of that

[245.879 - 250.5] so for instance one of the tools that

[247.44 - 253.019] we're looking at is using chialo so I

[250.5 - 254.7] did a test uh chialo here where it's

[253.019 - 257.04] basically like you have a you have a

[254.7 - 259.38] problem you have a few proposals and

[257.04 - 261.23900000000003] then you pick apart those proposals and

[259.38 - 262.8] so this is a way of organizing and

[261.239 - 264.78] formalizing debate I don't know if this

[262.8 - 267.78000000000003] is the way that we'll go certainly not

[264.78 - 270.9] in public not fully in public we're

[267.78 - 272.52] working through the process of consensus

[270.9 - 275.4] so we're basing it on a book called

[272.52 - 277.62] consensus through conversation which is

[275.4 - 279.84] has a five-step process five or six step

[277.62 - 283.08] process

[279.84 - 286.38] um and we are on step two which is set

[283.08 - 289.19899999999996] the decision criteria which is a list of

[286.38 - 291.419] criteria that whatever proposal you end

[289.199 - 293.28000000000003] up coming with uh or coming to or

[291.419 - 294.9] decision that you come to these are the

[293.28 - 296.75899999999996] criteria that must be met in order for

[294.9 - 299.34] it to be considered successful

[296.759 - 301.86] so I use gpt3 to summarize all the

[299.34 - 304.73999999999995] conversations into a list of must-haves

[301.86 - 306.84000000000003] nice to haves and must not haves and

[304.74 - 309.66] people seem to like that summary so we

[306.84 - 311.69899999999996] have we have some boundaries for our

[309.66 - 314.28000000000003] consensus policy that we're working on

[311.699 - 317.04] so then the question is okay why what do

[314.28 - 321.0] we use consensus for

[317.04 - 323.40000000000003] consensus will likely be used for making

[321.0 - 325.8] architectural decisions on how to deploy

[323.4 - 327.539] Raven so this will be things like you

[325.8 - 330.24] know what kind of containers to use what

[327.539 - 333.539] kind of cloud services to use

[330.24 - 335.88] um the the definitions around you know

[333.539 - 338.15999999999997] release one the MVP release two that

[335.88 - 340.74] sort of thing

[338.16 - 342.72] it probably oh we'll also use it to make

[340.74 - 344.039] decisions around like what communication

[342.72 - 345.78000000000003] channels should we use should we use

[344.039 - 346.62] like a shared Google Calendar should we

[345.78 - 350.58] use

[346.62 - 354.84000000000003] you know Discord or slack or whatever

[350.58 - 356.4] it probably will not extend into the

[354.84 - 360.419] full governance

[356.4 - 362.46] of of the whole Raven project so my

[360.419 - 367.79999999999995] startup is is almost certainly going to

[362.46 - 369.59999999999997] own the the product the overall process

[367.8 - 373.02000000000004] um we're talking with various uh

[369.6 - 374.88] potential investors and customers

[373.02 - 378.479] um in order to figure that out talking

[374.88 - 379.68] to the CTO of my startup we will

[378.479 - 381.0] probably

[379.68 - 383.16] or at least where we're looking right

[381.0 - 385.74] now is we will probably uh

[383.16 - 388.74] professionally code the Nexus service

[385.74 - 390.96000000000004] and the conductor service and then as

[388.74 - 392.94] once we establish

[390.96 - 394.44] all those guidelines all the all the

[392.94 - 397.62] standards all the apis and the

[394.44 - 399.96] deployments and stuff then

[397.62 - 401.819] as there's as there's a common framework

[399.96 - 405.0] then everyone else will be able to

[401.819 - 408.12] contribute microservices as they wish

[405.0 - 409.62] and we'll probably have templates so

[408.12 - 411.539] that if you have an idea for a micro

[409.62 - 414.18] service that you want to create you can

[411.539 - 415.919] just copy a baseline repository throw it

[414.18 - 418.34000000000003] in and it'll have all the all the you

[415.919 - 420.9] know basic authentication and other

[418.34 - 423.419] Telemetry Bells whistles and knobs and

[420.9 - 426.35999999999996] levers that you need to get started but

[423.419 - 428.81899999999996] we will probably own fully owned

[426.36 - 431.039] the Nexus and the conductor maybe a

[428.819 - 432.24] couple other Baseline Services we'll see

[431.039 - 433.979] that's the direction that we're going

[432.24 - 435.66] right now

[433.979 - 438.18] um so it is getting organized it is

[435.66 - 440.09900000000005] coming together my startup is also uh

[438.18 - 441.36] we're in crunch time for releasing our

[440.099 - 445.8] first product

[441.36 - 447.72] so that's why again uh uh progress is

[445.8 - 450.84000000000003] slow but this is also part of consensus

[447.72 - 453.3] too something this important deserves

[450.84 - 456.96] the time that it's going to take

[453.3 - 460.08] so with all that said we are in the

[456.96 - 462.65999999999997] middle of step two of consensus this

[460.08 - 463.62] time next week next Friday we will uh

[462.66 - 466.38000000000005] call

[463.62 - 468.12] um consensus step two we'll bring that

[466.38 - 470.88] to a close and then we'll start

[468.12 - 473.28000000000003] workshopping the actual proposal

[470.88 - 475.44] uh for our consensus so I'll probably

[473.28 - 477.539] draft something a bunch of other people

[475.44 - 479.699] will contribute and we will get to

[477.539 - 481.08] something where

[479.699 - 481.8] um you know the community will vote on

[481.08 - 485.099] it

[481.8 - 489.08] so that's where we're at those are the

[485.099 - 489.08] stakes and thanks for watching
