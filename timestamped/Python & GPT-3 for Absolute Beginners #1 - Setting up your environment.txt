[0.56 - 5.119999999999999] hey everybody david shapiro here with a

[2.96 - 8.48] uh the first video in a new tutorial

[5.12 - 10.0] series so this is python and gpt3 from

[8.48 - 12.799] the ground up so if you don't know

[10.0 - 15.2] anything about python or gpt3 and you

[12.799 - 16.72] want to get into it start here so this

[15.2 - 18.24] is going to be the boot camp starting

[16.72 - 20.16] from zero

[18.24 - 21.599999999999998] starting from scratch so the first thing

[20.16 - 24.16] you're going to want to do is take a

[21.6 - 25.439] look at this comic from xkcd from 10 15

[24.16 - 27.039] years ago

[25.439 - 28.72] it basically it's just making fun of how

[27.039 - 30.560000000000002] simple python is

[28.72 - 32.64] the the punch line is um how are you

[30.56 - 34.559] flying and i just i just typed import

[32.64 - 35.84] anti-gravity and then of course he

[34.559 - 38.079] sampled all the things in the medicine

[35.84 - 39.6] cabinet and then now he's flying

[38.079 - 40.879] um anyways

[39.6 - 43.52] so the first thing you do is you go to

[40.879 - 46.8] python.org downloads

[43.52 - 46.800000000000004] it downloads pretty quick

[47.44 - 52.239] you do install now and so

[50.0 - 54.0] the first time i did this i missed this

[52.239 - 55.279999999999994] because we're doing something so simple

[54.0 - 58.64] you don't need to worry about virtual

[55.28 - 61.28] environments so you make sure to click

[58.64 - 63.120000000000005] add python to path

[61.28 - 65.28] and you can expand here

[63.12 - 67.84] to see what else it'll do documentation

[65.28 - 71.04] that's fine pip you definitely need pip

[67.84 - 73.2] so pip is the pack package manager for

[71.04 - 76.24000000000001] python which allows you to install other

[73.2 - 79.60000000000001] stuff that python needs so

[76.24 - 81.439] that's fine install for all users

[79.6 - 82.479] you don't always need to do that but i

[81.439 - 84.24] do

[82.479 - 85.6] so that puts it right here in the

[84.24 - 87.03999999999999] standard thing

[85.6 - 88.24] again

[87.04 - 89.28] don't worry about virtual environments

[88.24 - 92.0] we're just going to install it as the

[89.28 - 93.84] system interpreter

[92.0 - 95.119] using virtual environments is more

[93.84 - 96.799] advanced so we're not going to worry

[95.119 - 98.96] about that

[96.799 - 102.07900000000001] so there you go i actually uninstalled

[98.96 - 103.67999999999999] python entirely just so to show like

[102.079 - 106.0] going from scratch

[103.68 - 107.92] um so this is python 3.10 that's the

[106.0 - 110.079] latest and greatest

[107.92 - 112.159] it's the same process uh

[110.079 - 114.88] probably forever it's been it's been the

[112.159 - 116.96000000000001] same for all of 3.3.

[114.88 - 118.64] it didn't used to come with pip you used

[116.96 - 120.55999999999999] to have to install that separately so

[118.64 - 122.719] the fact that they they include that now

[120.56 - 124.159] is is nice

[122.719 - 126.64] let me close my

[124.159 - 126.64] console

[126.88 - 130.399] so once this is done it'll add python to

[129.28 - 132.879] the um

[130.399 - 132.879] there we go

[133.76 - 140.79999999999998] okay so python dash dash version

[136.64 - 142.72] 3.10.5 there we go so pip install pip

[140.8 - 144.16000000000003] dash dash upgrade

[142.72 - 145.76] so you can do this

[144.16 - 147.44] it's recommended that that's the first

[145.76 - 149.44] thing that you do

[147.44 - 150.48] and because it upgrades your package

[149.44 - 152.48] manager

[150.48 - 154.879] so the command here is pip

[152.48 - 156.64] so that's the python package manager

[154.879 - 158.319] install pip so you're telling it to

[156.64 - 160.319] install something that's already there

[158.319 - 161.92] and then the dash dash upgrade tells you

[160.319 - 163.2] to upgrade

[161.92 - 164.79999999999998] now the very next thing you're going to

[163.2 - 167.28] want to do

[164.8 - 169.20000000000002] is install openai

[167.28 - 171.68] if you want to use gpt3 this is the

[169.2 - 173.28] module or the package that you can use

[171.68 - 175.84] and all you got to do is copy that to

[173.28 - 175.84] clipboard

[175.92 - 181.44] and you do control paste or shift insert

[178.64 - 184.879] for a command line

[181.44 - 187.76] pip install open ai

[184.879 - 190.39999999999998] and this is most of the way there

[187.76 - 191.67999999999998] so it'll run all the dependencies

[190.4 - 193.44] and unless your

[191.68 - 194.8] system is weird or something you

[193.44 - 197.35999999999999] shouldn't get any errors here this is

[194.8 - 199.20000000000002] pretty straightforward

[197.36 - 200.959] and if you already have open ai

[199.2 - 202.879] installed then you can just add that

[200.959 - 205.92000000000002] dash dash upgrade

[202.879 - 205.92] and away it goes

[209.28 - 213.92] that's giving me a few few notices

[212.959 - 215.84] yep

[213.92 - 218.48] which is not on path

[215.84 - 221.28] that's fine

[218.48 - 222.72] successfully installed ta-dah

[221.28 - 224.72] okay so we're most of the way there

[222.72 - 226.48] you're most of the way ready but now

[224.72 - 228.239] what how do you get code

[226.48 - 230.39999999999998] so if you watch my channel you'll know

[228.239 - 232.879] that i have i do a lot of code and i put

[230.4 - 235.36] all of my code up on github so how do

[232.879 - 237.439] you get stuff quickly and easily the

[235.36 - 241.519] answer there is you use git

[237.439 - 244.07999999999998] so you go to git dash scm.com downloads

[241.519 - 245.04] or slash download sorry

[244.08 - 246.4] you get

[245.04 - 248.07999999999998] you download git

[246.4 - 250.0] i've already got it but i'll go ahead

[248.08 - 252.4] and install the update

[250.0 - 254.959] so you can see the process

[252.4 - 256.0] so we will install git for windows

[254.959 - 257.28000000000003] um

[256.0 - 259.28] install

[257.28 - 260.71999999999997] removing previous get version so this is

[259.28 - 263.35999999999996] pretty much the same process you'll go

[260.72 - 266.0] through so what git does it is an open

[263.36 - 268.88] source code management tool it has

[266.0 - 270.639] become the standard code management tool

[268.88 - 272.56] globally

[270.639 - 274.479] we don't need to see the release notes

[272.56 - 277.12] okay so now that git is installed what

[274.479 - 277.12] do you do then

[277.44 - 280.479] what i do next or what i'll have you do

[279.6 - 283.04] next

[280.479 - 285.199] is you go to your command line um and

[283.04 - 287.12] you go to this repo so this is the this

[285.199 - 289.28000000000003] is the tutorial repo i'll put all the

[287.12 - 291.68] all the code and demos here

[289.28 - 292.79999999999995] so you go to this you click code the big

[291.68 - 295.84000000000003] green button

[292.8 - 298.639] and you see where it says https ssh or

[295.84 - 300.88] github cli just leave it on https that's

[298.639 - 302.40000000000003] the standard you click this

[300.88 - 303.84] for copied

[302.4 - 305.59999999999997] you come back in here

[303.84 - 307.44] you go to the root which you don't have

[305.6 - 310.639] to that's what i do you can also do cd

[307.44 - 312.96] um oh what was it no it's cd uh was it

[310.639 - 316.479] user

[312.96 - 318.56] i don't remember um user der

[316.479 - 320.96] whatever um i always copy stuff down to

[318.56 - 324.08] root just because uh it's shorter that

[320.96 - 325.28] way um so get clone and then shift

[324.08 - 327.59999999999997] insert

[325.28 - 329.44] um for for this

[327.6 - 333.199] uh and so this this

[329.44 - 335.6] goes to the python gbt3 tutorial dot git

[333.199 - 337.6] so the dot get file is the configuration

[335.6 - 340.8] file that it's going to use to download

[337.6 - 342.56] the entire repo so get clone

[340.8 - 345.039] and it down downloads it nice and quick

[342.56 - 347.199] then you do cd python

[345.039 - 349.12] and use tab to complete so tab is

[347.199 - 352.96000000000004] autocomplete so like if you type in

[349.12 - 355.68] windows and then complete like just win

[352.96 - 358.0] tab that'll do complete you can do

[355.68 - 361.36] program files and there's two different

[358.0 - 364.479] ones program data program files

[361.36 - 367.12] but we're going to go into python

[364.479 - 368.88] and then we'll do dur now windows

[367.12 - 371.199] started integrating uh linux command so

[368.88 - 372.08] i think ls dash all nope it doesn't work

[371.199 - 373.91900000000004] okay

[372.08 - 375.59999999999997] but dura will show you everything in the

[373.919 - 378.0] file which right now since i just

[375.6 - 380.0] started it it's fine okay

[378.0 - 381.6] so for review we've downloaded python

[380.0 - 383.919] and we've downloaded git and then we've

[381.6 - 386.319] cloned down this repo we've also

[383.919 - 389.52] installed um open ai

[386.319 - 391.03900000000004] so we're like right off the bat we've

[389.52 - 392.88] we've got a nice minimalist clean

[391.039 - 394.96] environment the last thing that i want

[392.88 - 397.039] you to download is notepad plus plus and

[394.96 - 399.12] this is if you're on windows actually i

[397.039 - 400.88] think notepad plus plus is on

[399.12 - 404.88] linux as well

[400.88 - 408.68] notepad plus plus is a basic text editor

[404.88 - 408.68] wait that's not what i wanted

[409.039 - 411.28] there we go

[410.16 - 412.56] um

[411.28 - 414.31899999999996] so they do have that deceptive thing

[412.56 - 416.0] make sure you click the the download on

[414.319 - 417.91900000000004] under the the

[416.0 - 421.759] lizard icon

[417.919 - 423.68] um notepad plus plus it is a minimalist

[421.759 - 425.759] development environment there are

[423.68 - 428.639] develop there are ides integrated

[425.759 - 430.88] development environments um like pycharm

[428.639 - 433.44] i stopped using pycharm years ago

[430.88 - 435.36] because it has its own environment

[433.44 - 436.639] variables and all sorts of other complex

[435.36 - 439.039] stuff

[436.639 - 440.8] that is just it's way overkill

[439.039 - 442.0] and i wanted the simplest environment

[440.8 - 442.8] possible

[442.0 - 444.96] so

[442.8 - 447.759] notepad plus plus

[444.96 - 450.15999999999997] it'll it'll do the um the language for

[447.759 - 452.40000000000003] you and everything one reason that i

[450.16 - 454.72] like using notepad plus plus over

[452.4 - 456.31899999999996] pycharm is that you have to learn to

[454.72 - 459.12] code correctly

[456.319 - 461.03900000000004] um pycharm will do a lot of stuff for

[459.12 - 463.36] you it's kind of like microsoft word and

[461.039 - 467.039] it'll recommend grammar and syntax

[463.36 - 469.28000000000003] changes which is great except you don't

[467.039 - 471.199] ever learn to do that yourself

[469.28 - 473.35999999999996] and we'll get into best practices for

[471.199 - 475.039] python in a future video but right now

[473.36 - 477.039] we're just focusing on setting up our

[475.039 - 478.56] environment and so what we've done is

[477.039 - 480.71999999999997] we've done python

[478.56 - 483.52] we've done git we've done notepad plus

[480.72 - 485.84000000000003] plus we've done open ai

[483.52 - 487.52] and then we've gotten this repo now by

[485.84 - 489.84] the time you download this there will be

[487.52 - 491.75899999999996] a little bit more in this repo

[489.84 - 494.87899999999996] so let me show you what i mean by in the

[491.759 - 497.199] repo so we'll just say

[494.879 - 498.639] copy paste

[497.199 - 502.96000000000004] your

[498.639 - 504.639] api key here so then i'll save this file

[502.96 - 506.56] we'll go to

[504.639 - 508.72] what was it uh

[506.56 - 511.199] python there we go

[508.72 - 514.32] um and so we'll call this

[511.199 - 516.24] open ai api

[514.32 - 518.399] key dot text

[516.24 - 519.2] and so we'll save this here

[518.399 - 521.36] and

[519.2 - 524.159] what i'll do is this will end up in here

[521.36 - 527.6] and so you'll go to your open ai account

[524.159 - 529.36] so it'll be um openai.com account api

[527.6 - 531.2] keys right here

[529.36 - 532.9590000000001] i'm not going to show you my key but

[531.2 - 536.72] what you do is you you click copy on

[532.959 - 538.4799999999999] that and you put it in this folder

[536.72 - 543.279] and so then we're basically just going

[538.48 - 545.6] to do the hello world of of um

[543.279 - 547.4399999999999] of gpt3 so

[545.6 - 549.6] import openai we'll just go ahead and

[547.44 - 552.24] save this

[549.6 - 553.839] and i'll save it as hello

[552.24 - 555.279] world.pi

[553.839 - 557.7600000000001] and you see that it changed the the

[555.279 - 560.32] formatting so that now import is

[557.76 - 560.3199999999999] highlighted

[560.88 - 565.76] i am super guilty of this i always copy

[562.88 - 568.0] paste my own all of my own old code um

[565.76 - 571.04] so i'm gonna do that real quick

[568.0 - 572.88] um and show you some basic functions

[571.04 - 575.279] that i use all the time

[572.88 - 578.48] um all right so we'll go in here

[575.279 - 578.48] oops no don't open that

[578.56 - 583.8389999999999] we will open it in a notepad plus plus

[581.68 - 586.0] okay so i always

[583.839 - 588.0] start with these few

[586.0 - 589.839] things right off the top

[588.0 - 591.36] and i'll show you what these do in just

[589.839 - 594.24] a second actually let me check the video

[591.36 - 595.76] length oh we're already at 10 minutes

[594.24 - 597.6] um so we're kind of we're kind of

[595.76 - 599.04] running long already but this will at

[597.6 - 602.9590000000001] least get you started with the hello

[599.04 - 605.68] world of of um your your your your life

[602.959 - 607.4399999999999] your life in gpt3 so i just write a

[605.68 - 610.56] quick function it's called open file you

[607.44 - 613.0400000000001] give it a file path it opens it um with

[610.56 - 615.1199999999999] encoding as utf-8 as in file and then it

[613.04 - 616.88] returns the contents of the file and

[615.12 - 620.9590000000001] then the very next thing is i return

[616.88 - 624.16] that and i pass this information back

[620.959 - 625.5189999999999] and so then what you can do oops

[624.16 - 629.6] is

[625.519 - 629.6] you can borrow this function

[630.16 - 636.399] which will be in this

[633.04 - 637.76] and i'll trim it down for you

[636.399 - 640.16] and you'll know that it works though

[637.76 - 642.16] because we'll i'll have you call this

[640.16 - 644.24] and you'll actually get a prompt or

[642.16 - 645.4399999999999] you'll get you'll get a response

[644.24 - 646.9590000000001] what i'm going to do is i'm going to

[645.44 - 648.32] simplify it a little bit because if it

[646.959 - 650.399] blows up

[648.32 - 651.44] i want you to do some troubleshooting on

[650.399 - 652.48] your own

[651.44 - 654.48] um

[652.48 - 658.399] and then we'll remove the while loop and

[654.48 - 658.399] we'll remove the accept part

[659.519 - 662.64] and we'll

[661.2 - 663.6] pull that back whoops

[662.64 - 665.76] okay

[663.6 - 667.76] so what this function does the first one

[665.76 - 669.2] super simple it just opens a file reads

[667.76 - 671.4399999999999] it and sends it back

[669.2 - 674.0790000000001] um we the second thing what we did is we

[671.44 - 675.6800000000001] set our api key to the contents of this

[674.079 - 678.56] which you'll need to update

[675.68 - 680.88] um and uh

[678.56 - 683.8389999999999] no special important note don't ever

[680.88 - 686.16] commit your api key to a repo because uh

[683.839 - 688.6400000000001] then someone else might see it one day

[686.16 - 690.3199999999999] that should be local only

[688.64 - 691.99] um we will

[690.32 - 693.2] simplify this

[691.99 - 695.6800000000001] [Music]

[693.2 - 697.6] so this is the stop we'll get into what

[695.68 - 700.3199999999999] all of these things do later

[697.6 - 703.839] um but yeah so this what this will do is

[700.32 - 703.839] it will just send back

[704.32 - 708.6400000000001] a completion and so then we'll say

[707.6 - 709.839] if

[708.64 - 711.279] name

[709.839 - 711.72] equals

[711.279 - 714.779] main

[711.72 - 714.779] [Music]

[714.88 - 720.639] then we'll say um my prompt equals

[718.16 - 722.56] uh what'll be a good prompt um

[720.639 - 725.12] write a list of

[722.56 - 728.4799999999999] uh of um

[725.12 - 730.639] famous american actors

[728.48 - 734.72] okay so that'll be our prompt then

[730.639 - 736.24] response will be equals uh gpt3 whoops

[734.72 - 738.24] completion

[736.24 - 740.639] and we'll pass the prompt in and then

[738.24 - 742.5600000000001] we'll print the response now i'm not

[740.639 - 744.639] going to run this because your homework

[742.56 - 746.4799999999999] is you've got to run this yourself which

[744.639 - 748.639] means you've got to get all this

[746.48 - 749.839] cloned downloaded and put in your api

[748.639 - 751.6] key here

[749.839 - 753.839] and we'll call that a day

[751.6 - 755.12] so just as a quick review here's what

[753.839 - 758.0790000000001] we've done

[755.12 - 760.399] we we looked at our xkcd comic from many

[758.079 - 762.16] years ago we downloaded python we

[760.399 - 764.88] downloaded git

[762.16 - 767.519] we downloaded notepad plus plus

[764.88 - 769.4399999999999] we installed openai which allows us to

[767.519 - 772.48] talk to gpt3

[769.44 - 773.9200000000001] and then we cloned down this tutorial

[772.48 - 776.0] repo

[773.92 - 777.92] and then i showed you how to get your

[776.0 - 780.56] api key so what you'll do is you'll just

[777.92 - 782.4799999999999] click this that copy button come in here

[780.56 - 785.04] to open ai key

[782.48 - 787.44] open ai api key dot text and copy paste

[785.04 - 789.36] it in here make sure there's no spaces

[787.44 - 792.0790000000001] or anything it'll just be the first line

[789.36 - 794.0] and that's it and then what you do

[792.079 - 796.3199999999999] and this is going to bomb in order to

[794.0 - 797.76] test it you type in python

[796.32 - 800.48] hello world

[797.76 - 802.399] and it's not going to work um except

[800.48 - 805.12] finally oh whoops see this is why you

[802.399 - 807.76] test your code kids what did i miss

[805.12 - 809.92] oh i forgot to remove the try

[807.76 - 812.16] there we go

[809.92 - 813.92] ta-da okay now it works it would be

[812.16 - 816.48] really unfortunate if i sent you code

[813.92 - 819.36] that didn't actually work okay

[816.48 - 821.36] now this will still bomb because the api

[819.36 - 822.5600000000001] key is invalid so let me show you what

[821.36 - 824.639] will happen

[822.56 - 826.079] so it'll say hello world it'll say uh

[824.639 - 827.6800000000001] hey

[826.079 - 828.399] something didn't work

[827.68 - 829.8389999999999] you know

[828.399 - 831.6] uh open ai

[829.839 - 833.9200000000001] yep so here's the error right here open

[831.6 - 835.1990000000001] ai error authentication incorrect api

[833.92 - 837.519] key provided

[835.199 - 840.079] um it did not like

[837.519 - 842.72] my api key so you need to fix that that

[840.079 - 845.279] is your very first homework so then to

[842.72 - 847.44] save save your work um or to save my

[845.279 - 849.36] work i'll do git add

[847.44 - 851.9200000000001] dot

[849.36 - 853.76] so then i do that adds all files so then

[851.92 - 856.76] i do get stat

[853.76 - 856.76] um

[857.44 - 862.639] no git status sorry

[859.6 - 865.0400000000001] um so there's two new files to add

[862.639 - 867.36] so i'll do git commit am and we'll do a

[865.04 - 869.5999999999999] deeper dive on git in the future

[867.36 - 871.36] and we'll say initial commit

[869.6 - 873.1990000000001] and then i'll do git push

[871.36 - 874.5600000000001] and so what that does is it says okay

[873.199 - 876.3199999999999] every i've looked at all the changes

[874.56 - 878.2399999999999] that i've made locally i want to push it

[876.32 - 880.32] back up to the cloud so what we'll do

[878.24 - 881.839] then is we'll go back up to git and i'll

[880.32 - 883.7600000000001] just do a quick refresh and you'll see

[881.839 - 885.1990000000001] that those files are now here and so

[883.76 - 887.68] these are the files that you're going to

[885.199 - 889.519] use to start learning python and get

[887.68 - 891.76] your environment set up
